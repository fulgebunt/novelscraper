    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 1Chapter 1A twilight sky.It rotted away into darkness as the ground disintegrated. The place they\u2019d called home for ages.The Tower was falling apart.\u201cSo we\u2019ve lost.\u201dThose were words no one dared to say because it felt like it would finally become true once it was spoken.The ten \u201cGods\u201d who were gathered around started reminiscing their epics.\u201cSo is this really the end?\u201d\u201cI never imagined that this would be how we part ways.\u201d\u201cWell said. I knew it had to end one way or another but\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not get mushy and make this quick. We\u2019re done for anyways.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean done for? It\u2019s not over yet.\u201dA platinum white-haired man holding a long staff spoke. It was Son OhGong.* He held the title of [The Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal] and was the protagonist of the myth \u201cHeavenly Realm\u2019s Traitor.\u201d*T/N: Son OhGong is the Korean name for Sun Wukong, the Monkey King.\u201cYou\u2019re talking big for someone who\u2019s on the brink of death.\u201dThe one who disputed Son OhGong\u2019s confidence was Hercules, wearing his lion skin, wielding a broken club. Having brought victory in the war against the Titans, the greatest hero of Olympus was nearing death with one of his arms cut off.\u201cI\u2019m not dying.\u201d\u201cYou might be an\u00a0\u2018Immortal,\u2019 but can you really keep acting so mighty in front of them?\u201dHercules turned his head, staring at the beings flying far above the twilight skies. Gods of the Other Realm.The Outer Gods.[Despair that Reaches the Skies, Gloom Trapped in a Swamp]; [One Who Couldn\u2019t Be Born]; [Foolish Calamity]\u2026Normal people would lose their life simply by looking at them. Such beings were tearing apart their world.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll soon discover this place.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a chance they already have.\u201dWhoosh\u2014Thud\u2014A pure white mass flew down from out of nowhere. All the Gods turned their gazes towards the mass before looking back towards the person\u2019s voice.\u201cSo I made it back.\u201d\u201cI thought I was going to die.\u201dJet black hair with eyes just as dark, the man had short, messy hair. YuWon looked drained, taking slow steps towards the makeshift tree trunk chair before sitting down.\u201cIt\u2019s just you?\u201d Hercules asked.The companions that definitely left with him were nowhere to be found, and YuWon came back alone.\u201c\u2026 Uh-huh.\u201d\u201cMerlin, Asura, Vishnu\u2026 All of them?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dYuWon nodded his head.\u201cThey\u2019re all dead.\u201dThe air became somber.The Gods that left with YuWon were unable to come back. They were probably swallowed up by those beings, nourishing the Other Realm.The somber mood was short-lived. The Gods turned their attention towards the pure white mass that YuWon threw.\u201cWho is this bastard?\u201d\u201c[Foolish Chaos].\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe surviving Gods were shocked by YuWon\u2019s response.They knew it wouldn\u2019t be someone normal when YuWon came back alone, but its identity was even greater than they imagined.\u201c\u2026 Really? It\u2019s that guy?\u201dYuWon nodded his head.\u201cWith this, I now know for a fact.\u201dOne of the Outer Gods.YuWon realized the cold, hard truth in his fight against the [Foolish Chaos].\u201cAn\u00a0\u2018Inner\u2019 cannot beat an\u00a0\u2018Outer.\u2019\u201dInner.That was how beings that existed within the Tower, like YuWon, were referred to. And those who were gathered here were beings that had risen to the top floor of the Tower, forging their myth, earning divinity and a divine name.But even they couldn\u2019t compare to the Gods of the Other Realm.Actually, this was something they knew all along. Since the start of this fight, when the Gods of the Other Realm appeared. Their existence was a calamity, even to those who thought they were equal to a god.\u201cThere is no way to win.\u201dThe old man who was sitting in the corner spoke.\u201cFor now, that is.\u201dHe stretched out his hand to reveal a clock\u2019s internal mechanics in his palm.\u300cChronos\u2019s Clock Movement*\u300d*PR/N: This is the name of an object. A movement is the watchmakers\u2019 term for the inner mechanisms of a clock; everything but a clock\u2019s exterior shell.YuWon asked while staring at the old man, Chronos, \u201cIs this the only way?\u201d\u201cReturn to an old world line. And start over.\u201d\u201cIf possible, I wanted to end this here.\u201d\u201cThis was the last chance.\u201d Chronos spoke with a powerful voice, which contrasted with his hunchback and wrinkled face.Chronos was a being that possessed the Divinity to control time. The items he crafted held powers relating to time. But\u2026\u201cIn the world line you will return to, I will probably have disappeared. It is a fair price to pay for the only way to go back in time and shift the world line. So do not waste your energy looking for me.\u201d\u201cSo you will cease to exist?\u201d\u201cI do not know in what form it will be, but my disappearance does not matter.\u201dTheir story had already ended, which is why YuWon wanted the fight to end here. However, the fight was a loss in the end. Now, there was no other option but to return.\u201cSo who will\u2026\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes turned to YuWon.It was already decided who would be returning to the past.The only thing remaining was YuWon\u2019s decision.\u201cI expected it, but it really is gonna be me?\u201d\u201cThat is right.\u201dIt was something that was talked about since the Clock Movement was first brought up, who would return to the past. It wasn\u2019t for certain, but there were two main candidates.YuWon and Son OhGong.But while YuWon was absent, there must have been some sort of discussion because a decision was made.\u201c\u2026 Why me?\u201d\u201cBecause you entered last. Yet despite that, you are standing here right now.\u201dIt was true. YuWon entered the Tower later than everyone else present. However, he adjusted to this world and climbed the Tower faster than anyone else, arriving at this place where he could fight together.\u201cYou didn\u2019t forget, right? Beings on the upper floors are restricted in how they can intervene with the lower floors. So, in order to change the Tower, we have to start from the lower floors and go up.\u201d\u201cYeah, I know.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re our only choice.\u201dYuWon let out a deep sigh as he reached out his hand.The Clock Movement continued to send time forward. The instructions would be registered in a person\u2019s mind as soon as they held the item.\u201cWhen you return back in time, we probably won\u2019t have the same relationship we have now. So even if I don\u2019t recognize you, just let it slide. That me really won\u2019t know who you are.\u201d\u201cKnock some sense into the guys who can\u2019t comprehend the situation. If all else fails, you can just kill them.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I hope you have a hard time, my friend.\u201dEach gave a word to YuWon. Now that this was the final farewell, they didn\u2019t hold back.\u201cYou guys are never short for words.\u201dYuWon put on a melancholic smile as he gave his companions a good, final look.After the Gods of the Other Realm appeared, they had no choice but to join forces. No one here were companions in the beginning. Some were antagonistic and hostile. Some even aimed for each others\u2019 throats.But everything was different now.Recollecting, it seemed impossible.\u2018They were all very bull-headed\u2026\u2019Tick-tock\u2014He was already filled with worry. He wondered if he\u2019d be able to gather all these idiots together in one place after returning to the past. If they\u2019d be able to fight the beings from the Other World, if they\u2019d be able to win this fight\u2026If he\u2019d be able to change everything for the better.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euTick-tock\u2014The Clock Movement started moving backwards.\u2018I guess I\u2019m going to have a hard time.\u2019Within YuWon\u2019s field of vision, countless clock mechanisms started moving backwards.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 2Chapter 2YuWon slowly opened his eyes after having been engulfed by countless Clock Movements.\u2018So my body didn\u2019t return to the past. Instead, my time was rewound.\u2019His body felt light like a deflated balloon. Stats, mana\u2014everything that strengthened his body was gone.It was a shame. If he could have returned to the past with the powers he possessed, things would be a lot easier.\u2018I guess that would have been much harder to make happen.\u2019Sending just the soul back in time versus sending a physical body back in time are two completely different sets of problems.When a body is sent back in time, you need to deal with the problem of having two versions of the same person in the same time period, not to mention that it requires much greater energy to cross the timeline. So that would probably be an impossible feat, even for Chronos.\u2018This means I need to start over from zero\u2026\u2019Returning to the past felt like waking up from a long slumber. In order to find out how far back in time he went back, YuWon started observing his surroundings.Wham\u2014!He felt a heavy impact on his face.What a shitty moment to return to.\u201cHold up. Gonna act like a big man?\u201dHis blurry vision came back into focus, revealing a man in front of him.A well-toned physique, a long nose, and an attempt at making a scary expression.\u2018Who in the world is this?\u2019It happened so long ago, he couldn\u2019t remember right away. That\u2019s when YuWon noticed the clothes the man was wearing.\u2018Oh, right.\u2019CheongSol University.The man was wearing a letterman jacket from the university YuWon used to attend. His memories were fuzzy because it was such a distant memory, but looking at the letterman jacket helped him remember the fact that he used to be a college student.YuWon was at one of the gyms on campus.\u2018What was this guy\u2019s name\u2026?\u2019It was almost coming back to him.Whoosh\u2014\u201cHuh?\u201dWhen his punch missed, the man became visibly confused.YuWon took a step back, muttering to himself, \u201cWas it tomorrow, or was it today?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s today\u2019s date? If you answer me quickly, I\u2019ll forgive you for punching me since your weak punch didn\u2019t even really hurt.\u201dThe man\u2019s expression turned extremely sour. He probably thought he was being mocked.\u201cWhat did you just say, bitch\u2026? You lose your mind? What the fuck are you spouting? You even dropped the honorifics\u2026\u201dSwoosh\u2014Wham\u2014!The man\u2019s head spun. The ceiling and the floor blending together was the last thing he saw before falling on his ass.\u201cI guess I don\u2019t need your help. I\u2019ve got my phone, after all.\u201dThere was no point to YuWon\u2019s question. In his pocket he could feel his smartphone, which would tell him what he wanted to know.After checking the date with his phone, YuWon looked down at the fellow that was knocked out cold on the floor.\u201cSchool should be on break. Do you really have nothing better to do with your free time?\u201dHe saw the man\u2019s name in his call log.He finally remembered. It was a guy by the name of Kim MyungHoon.He was a grade above YuWon, and he was well known for being a garbage human being in the physical education department.\u2018And here I was getting beat up without even knowing the reason.\u2019He really didn\u2019t know why. The semester was over, yet Kim MyungHoon had called YuWon over to beat YuWon to a pulp. He had told YuWon to think of the reason himself.\u201cThen you deserve a hard time as well,\u201d YuWon said to his unconscious body.The date was December 31st, 2019. It was the last day of the year.YuWon remembered December 31st as the day the Tutorial first started.\u2018What perfect timing.\u2019It was a good date. Not too early, not too late.There was no way to know if it was a coincidence or if Chronos set the date, but YuWon was pleased with his situation.The time was 3PM.\u2018So nine hours \u2018til midnight.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a lot of time to prepare and select a location.\u201cI guess I\u2019ll be busy starting today.\u201d* * *When Kim MyungHoon finally regained consciousness, it was late evening.All the lights were off, and on the floor of the dark gym, MyungHoon was woken up by his phone vibrating.\u2018Oh, right.\u2019He had plans.7PM. He was supposed to meet up with his friends for a drink over dinner.\u201cGod, fucking dammit\u2026\u201dRemembering why he was passed out, Kim MyungHoon started swearing in anger. He got knocked out while lecturing his underclassmen. It was something he could never tell anyone out of sheer embarrassment.\u2018I\u2019m going to teach that asshole a proper lesson real soon.\u2019A lucky punch. That\u2019s what MyungHoon brushed it off as.He was pretty infamous for his fighting skills, while Kim YuWon had a smaller physique among the underclassmen, on top of being a pushover.\u201cYeah, you called? Uh, yeah. I was just teaching someone a lesson. Where?\u201dAfter quickly grabbing his belongings, MyungHoon took a taxi to Hongdae.Once he cleaned up the nosebleed and brushed the dirt off his clothes, he looked fine again.Not only was it December 31st, it was a Thursday, so Hongdae was overcrowded with people excited for their four-day holiday.\u201cDamn, this is a lot of people.\u201d\u201cHey, here. Over here!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re late. We\u2019re charging you a late fee!\u201dMyungHoon\u2019s friends had been waiting for him. His fellow class of 2018.* They were all guys due to serve in the army soon.*T/N: Korea labels college classes by year of admittance.\u201cWhy were you so hard to get a hold of?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re an hour late. That\u2019ll be 50,000 won*.\u201d*T/N: Approx $45 USD\u201cCut the crap.\u201dThey served MyungHoon a drink as soon as he sat down. Since they had already been drinking for an hour, one of them was flushed red.\u201cHey now, why is this mofo being such a fucking downer?\u201cDidn\u2019t you just get back from blowing off some steam?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it. Just give me another drink.\u201dHe felt the need to get drunk.As per MyungHoon\u2019s request, his friends mixed another glass of beer with soju. Thinking it\u2019d raise his spirits, one of MyungHoon\u2019s buddies asked him while handing him a drink, \u201cSo, what did you do with Kim YuWon?\u201dKim MyungHoon\u2019s hand that was raising the drink to his lips froze for just a second. He got lost in thought for a moment before smirking and replying.\u201cI beat the shit out of him. I hope he made it to the hospital.\u201d\u201cC\u2019mon, go a li\u2019l bit easier. Or he might kill himself.\u201d\u201cSo what if he does? Doesn\u2019t that fucker not have any parents? Who\u2019s gonna come after us?\u201d\u201cEh, you\u2019re right. Is it really our fault if he commits suicide? If he kills himself because he was beat up a few times, it\u2019s his fault for being such a little bitch.\u201dKim MyungHoon was pleased by his friends\u2019 agreement. Everyone was partying. The bad memory from earlier that day was quickly fading away.\u2018It\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll just beat the crap out of him later.\u2019As long as he did that, he could claim that today\u2019s events never happened.Round one and round two flashed by. After drinking just beer and soju, for round three, they decided to drink some expensive liquor.\u201cWhy the fuck are there so many people!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the four-day weekend.\u201d\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201c11:50\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost 2020.\u201dThe cool breeze was gently sobering them up. When his head stopped feeling so hazy, MyungHoon threw his finished cigarette on the ground and started walking.\u201cHey, let\u2019s get a move on. We don\u2019t want to sober up now, do we?\u201d\u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Kim YuWon?\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cOh shit, it is him.\u201dKim MyungHoon froze over the words of his friends. He turned his head, pretending like nothing was wrong.\u2018Why is that fucker here?\u2019It really was him.In the midst of a crowd, YuWon was standing still, holding a luggage case in one hand. People just brushed past YuWon, who stood like a statue. He wasn\u2019t moving, looking like he was waiting for someone.\u2018Is this for real? Fuck\u2026\u2019It really wasn\u2019t his day. Meeting Kim YuWon here and now, before even getting the chance to properly get his revenge.\u201cDoesn\u2019t he look fine?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cIs he waiting for someone? What\u2019s up with that carry-on?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go say hi.\u201d\u201cWhy greet him? What are y\u2019all scheming?\u201dMyungHoon\u2019s friends were already walking up to YuWon.\u2018I\u2019m seriously going to kill him.\u2019Kim MyungHoon ground his teeth in anger, remembering the event from earlier that day. Now that it had come to this, he decided to crush YuWon, even if it meant losing face in front of his friends.\u201cHey, Kim YuWon!\u201dMyungHoon led his pack towards YuWon, a total of six people including himself.When outnumbering someone, one naturally felt no fear. MyungHoon asked, baring his white teeth, \u201cWhat business you got here?\u201dThe six surrounded YuWon.People started steering clear to avoid their threatening aura. It looked like a fight could break out at any moment.Instead of answering MyungHoon\u2019s question, YuWon checked his electronic wristwatch.\u201cIt\u2019s almost 12 o\u2019clock.\u201d[ 11 : 57 : 12 ]Once he had checked the time, YuWon took the watch off his wrist and threw it to the ground.\u201cEnjoy your last three minutes\u2026\u201dThud\u2014Ziiip\u2014YuWon opened up his large luggage case. He rummaged around, pulling stuff out as he spoke to them.\u201cSince it\u2019ll be hell after that.\u201dThey didn\u2019t know.The events that were about to unfold, the kind of world they would have to start living in.That\u2019s why they did not know what a sweet and precious moment these last three minutes were.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cFucking bitch, what are you blabbering about\u2026\u201dKim MyungHoon walked menacingly towards YuWon, only to take a few steps back in fear. It was because he saw what YuWon pulled out of his luggage.\u201cAhh, are you\u2026 fu-fucking nuts?\u201dThe items he pulled out were all very threatening weapons. A sashimi knife, swiss army knife, machete, an axe\u2026 and a bag whose contents were a mystery.YuWon hung the swiss army knife and axe on his waist and wielded the sashimi knife.\u201cHey, a-apologize already!\u201d\u201cH-How hard did you beat this kid up that he\u2019s come to this?\u201d\u201cYeah, bro. You\u2014you\u2019re clearly in the wrong here!\u201d\u201cHey, YuWon. You shouldn\u2019t be like this either! I get that you\u2019re really angry, but\u2026\u201dA crowd formed around YuWon, who was holding various weapons. People kept murmuring. MyungHoon didn\u2019t dare approach YuWon, frightened by the sashimi knife. Some people even called the cops.\u201858 minutes.\u2019There wasn\u2019t a lot of time left.YuWon put the bag he pulled out of the luggage on his shoulder and looked around.\u2018This should be enough people.\u2019Hongdae. It was one of the most populated places in Seoul, according to YuWon\u2019s memories.\u2018It was Anyang, previously.\u2019YuWon lifted his chin and looked up at the sky.The clouds stopped moving.Everyone was focused on the commotion. No one was paying any attention to the phenomenon that was occurring. They only saw the weapons YuWon was holding and that he was causing a ruckus.\u2018Finally\u2026\u2019In the midst of the chaos, YuWon checked the watch he dropped on the ground.\u201cIt\u2019s starting.\u201dZzzzzt\u2014!A noise rang in his ears.The noise wasn\u2019t exclusive to YuWon. The hundreds and thousands of people roaming the streets of Hongdae covered their ears. Some people even fainted from the sound that rang inside their head and eardrums. YuWon stood silent, watching the landscape morph around him.Kkk\u2014gukuk\u2014Crack! Kkk\u2014The ground split apart, and never-before-seen plants grew from the fissure.\u201cGuuuuuh\u2014\u201dThe color of the clouds floating in the sky inverted, turning black.The electronic watch froze at 2020, 00:00 hours.[SECTOR\u00a0 20131][POPULATION : 12,014]It was a welcoming message. 12,000 people. Picking Hongdae was not the wrong choice.\u201cGuuuuahhhh\u2014!\u201d\u201cGyaaaa\u2014\u201dThe first things that could be heard once the ringing stopped were frightening roars.\u201c\u2026 They\u2019re here.\u201dThe roars echoed between the buildings.YuWon, holding the knife in his hand, walked past Kim MyungHoon and his gang. They were still covering their ears.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d[THE TUTORIAL WILL NOW BEGIN.]\u201cThe three minutes.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The difficulty was related to the number of people, so the higher the population, the higher the difficulty.It made sense. Since there were more people that could cooperate, the missions had to have stronger monsters to make things fair.At least, that would be the logical reasoning.\u2018It\u2019s all nonsensical.\u2019\u201cKiyaaaah\u2014!\u201d\u201cMo-Monsters!\u201d\u201cZom\u2026bies? It\u2019s fucking zombies!\u201dYuWon observed the people that screamed and ran in terror after discovering the zombies.It was unavoidable. The streets of Hongdae were far too small for how densely populated it was.Elsewhere, the streets would be wide and empty, leaving more room for people to escape. There would also be fewer zombies, significantly lowering the difficulty.\u2018There\u2019s just too many people in the streets.\u2019There wasn\u2019t an adequate place to run away to. Therefore, the streets of Hongdae would become flooded by the blood of people torn apart by zombies.There was only a single solution to this problem\u2014when you can\u2019t run, you should fight. You can\u2019t survive such a large horde simply by running.As this place became a \u201cTutorial Zone,\u201d you could only run so far, and zombies were hiding around every corner. And\u2026\u2018It\u2019s a normal reaction.\u2019YuWon was the same.Accepting the world as it was, adapting, and doing everything he could to survive only happened after the Tutorial started.[You are able to check your status by saying the activation phrase \u201cStatus Window.\u201d][You have obtained a basic weapon \u2013 \u300cOld Knife\u300d]Each person was given a weapon: knives, hammers, spears, and various other weapons. It seems like everyone was given a weapon that they could utilize well. YuWon was given a knife.Clank\u2014YuWon tossed the knife away.It was an item with a dull blade. You could barely call it a weapon.\u2018I couldn\u2019t even kill three zombies with this thing.\u2019It would be a different story if he could utilize it well, but the old knife was just slightly better than going bare-handed. In truth, it was no better than a steel rod. It was a weapon that was so old, it could break any time.On the other hand, the theme of the 1st Tutorial was \u201cSurvival.\u201dThe countless zombies would continue to respawn no matter how many you killed.\u201cKiyaaah\u2014!\u201d\u201cDo-Don\u2019t push!\u201d\u201cFucking move, damn it!\u201dThe unfortunate people who happened to be close to the zombies were already getting bit, shoving and pulling each other.They didn\u2019t hesitate to sacrifice others for their own survival. That was human nature.\u2018Surviving, huh\u2026\u2019YuWon unzipped his bags, opening a small bottle that was inside.\u201cThat won\u2019t be enough.\u201dThe things YuWon had to do couldn\u2019t be achieved by simply clearing the Tutorial normally .Before, simply surviving was enough, but now he had a more important objective.YuWon had brought other weapons to use instead of the old knife. And one more thing\u2026YuWon poured the contents of the bottle onto the sashimi knife.Splash\u2014\u201cAlright.\u201dDone preparing, YuWon had a fierce look in his eyes.He didn\u2019t need to check his own status. He could feel what his starting stats were.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dVroom\u2014YuWon dove head-first into the horde of zombies.Zombies were slow and weak, but to compensate, they were immune to pain and extremely hard to kill. You needed a lot of strength to kill them. There weren\u2019t a lot of people in the 1st Tutorial who would be able to kill them. But\u2026Slash\u2014[You were the first to kill a zombie in your area.][You have obtained 100 points.][Your experience points massively increased.][You leveled up.][Strength increased by 1.][Dexterity increased by 1.][Constitution increased by 1.]The sashimi knife sliced through the zombies\u2019 heads with great ease.\u2018Perfect.\u2019A smile crossed YuWon\u2019s face.It was worth moving quickly. The reward for the first zombie kill was quite generous for the effort it took. 100 points were hard to gain in the early stages of the Tutorial, and the stats that came with the level-up would be very useful.His arms and legs were stronger\u2014the power of the strength stat.The zombies appeared slower, while his body felt lighter\u2014the power of the dexterity stat.His body felt revitalized, while his breathing stabilized\u2014the power of the constitution stat.YuWon kept moving.Shing-\u2014!Stab, stab, stab\u2014!Slash\u2014YuWon swung his knife, cutting down the zombies one by one in a flash.[You leveled up.][You leveled\u2026]Leveling up was quick in the beginning. Of course, it was also due to YuWon cutting the heads off of zombies as fast as he could.A flurry of endorphin-rushing notifications.\u2018This feels great.\u2019YuWon laughed, seeing the endless number of zombies surrounding him.This was one of his reasons for selecting Hongdae for his Tutorial location. The number of zombies directly correlated to the population of the region. And that would be consistent until the next area of the Tutorial.Watching YuWon cut down dozens of zombies by himself, the people\u2019s reactions started to change one by one.\u201cHold up\u2026\u201d\u201cCould the zombies actually be pretty weak?\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t that seem pretty doable?\u201dWherever you go, there will always be people without fear. A few people started joining the fight after witnessing YuWon slaughter the zombies.The rewards from the early stages of the Tutorial were extremely important. Among the people who were quick to act that day, a few of them would probably make it to the upper floors of the Tower. But of course\u2026\u2018It won\u2019t be easy.\u2019\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cWha\u2014what\u2019s up with these things!\u201d\u201cWhy won\u2019t they die!\u201dNo matter how hard you hit them in the head with a sword, zombies wouldn\u2019t die easily. It was no laughing matter, slicing the head of a zombie with a dull, old sword. Many got bit by the zombies, surprised that the zombies weren\u2019t so easy to kill.\u2018The toxins of a zombie are bound to be fatal to the participants of the 1st Tutorial.\u2019Slice\u2014The knife didn\u2019t feel like it was making as smooth a cut anymore. It felt as though the knife had become dull, however, that was not the reason.\u201cTsk.\u201dPow\u2014!YuWon made a sound of disapproval while kicking away a zombie.The effect must have worn off.Zip\u2014YuWon pulled out another bottle in a hurry.Smash\u2014!Splash\u2014He cut the bottle apart with his sword, wetting the blade with its contents.The salty, fishy smell pierced YuWon\u2019s nose.\u2018It\u2019s definitely working.\u2019YuWon remembered a distant memory, something one of his companions told him right after they entered the Tower.\u201cUnlike you, I don\u2019t have any talents. Seriously, compare me to anyone, and it becomes obvious how untalented I am.\u201d\u201cAt least you still survived.\u201d\u201cI was lucky. I made an amazing discovery in the 1st Tutorial.\u201d\u201cThe first one? Don\u2019t you just have to survive against zombies in that one?\u201d\u201cDo you know where I used to work?\u201d\u201cWork? Why are you bringing up your work\u2026? What was your job?\u201d\u2018The man I met on the 1st Floor was quite fortunate. Right about now, unlike most people, he is probably hunting zombies with ease.\u2019\u201cI managed salt evaporation ponds. The zombies in the 1st Tutorial\u2026\u201cTheir weakness is salt.\u201dSlash\u2014Once again, the sashimi knife cut the zombie\u2019s head like it was butter.It was thanks to the salt water that YuWon had just poured on the knife.[You have defeated 100 zombies in 10 minutes.][You have achieved an unbelievable feat in the Tutorial.][You have obtained 3 unallocated stat points.][Unallocated stat points will be distributed at random if unused by the end of the Tutorial.]Yuwon\u2019s eyes widened. He wasn\u2019t expecting this kind of reward.\u2018It\u2019s possible to earn unallocated stat points in the Tutorial?\u2019Unallocated stat points were a valuable reward. You gain stats at random when you level up, so unallocated stat points were very useful since it could be used to raise any stats you wanted. Your level becomes harder to raise the higher it is, but unallocated stat points were completely separate from the leveling system.\u2018Should I save it for later?\u2019Currently, Arcane Power was disabled. Arcane Power would only be available starting in the middle stages of the Tutorial. It was the most efficient stat, as well as the hardest to raise. That was Arcane Power.But instead of saving the points for later, it might be better to use it now for an immediate power boost.YuWon made a decision after weighing his options.\u2018Let\u2019s save it for now.\u2019Looking at the big picture, it seemed like a waste to use unallocated stat points to crush some measly zombies. Besides, YuWon wasn\u2019t going to simply slash and stab the zombies anymore.\u2018It\u2019s the ten minute mark.\u2019The number of zombies would start overflowing any second now.YuWon had to hurry and make his preparations.\u2018Where would be an adequate place\u2026?\u2019YuWon looked around as he cleared himself a path by slicing and dicing zombies. The streets had devolved into absolute chaos from the battle between people and zombies. In the midst of his search, a place caught YuWon\u2019s attention.\u2018Found it.\u2019* * *\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dCrack\u2014!Kim MyungHoon swung his old knife.Once again it didn\u2019t go as expected. He couldn\u2019t get a clean cut on the zombie\u2019s head.\u2018Fuck! Why isn\u2019t this working?!\u2019He couldn\u2019t figure out the reason.YuWon, who charged into the zombies faster than anyone else, slayed the zombies like it was nothing.In comparison, MyungHoon, as well as others, were barely killing one zombie after multiple slashes.\u2018Is it because the blade is dull?\u2019YuWon wielded a different knife.Instead of a worn out knife, he used the sashimi knife and machete he happened to have on hand.\u2018Damn it. If only I had a proper weapon like him\u2026\u2019\u201cGuuuuuuuh\u2014\u201dA zombie with its head half-split open roared.The nasty stench was unbearable. Startled, MyungHoon kicked the zombie in the chest.Bam\u2014!\u201cFucking hell!\u201dThe zombie must have felt no pain. After falling down, it got back up like it was nothing. Kim MyungHoon stared at the unfaltering zombie in disgust.\u201cHey, MyungHoon.\u201d\u201cIs it just me\u2026 or are they growing in numbers?\u201d As their stamina was reaching their limits, MyungHoon\u2019s friend asked him this question.He bit his trembling lips. He knew it as well.\u2018Instead of decreasing, they\u2019re multiplying.\u2019There was no way they could handle this many of them.\u201cGuwaaaaaah\u2014\u201d\u201cGyaaack\u2014\u201dThey were surrounded by zombies on all sides.There was no way to escape, nor did they have any strength left to continue fighting. Their fates were sealed.Can we hold these bastards off?How are we supposed to survive in this situation?\u2018How the fuck are we supposed to do that?!\u2019Kim MyungHoon heard the answer in that moment.\u201cYuWon! Where did YuWon go?\u201dThere was only one way to survive now that they were surrounded.Kim YuWon.They had to receive his help. YuWon\u2019s skill was the real deal, being able to cut zombies like they were made of tofu.\u201cHe\u2019s gone!\u201d\u201cFuck, where did that motherfucker go?!\u201d\u201cThey\u2014they\u2019re coming!\u201d\u201cGuwaaaah\u2014\u201dThe zombies were closing in tighter on them.Kim MyungHoon swung his knife with all he had.At that very moment\u2026Clang\u2014!His eyes opened wide. A fragment of his knife had fallen to the ground. The knife he was swinging broke in half.\u201cAre you fucking\u2014\u201dThough completely dull, it was at least something that MyungHoon could use as a weapon to protect himself. Now, he no longer had a way to defend himself against the zombies.\u201cGuwaaah\u2014\u201dA zombie got within spitting distance, widening its jaws at MyungHoon.A nose-piercing stench. Rotten teeth that would soon tear him apart.\u201cAhhhhhhhh\u2014!\u201dHe screamed, helplessly watching the zombie that was about to take his life.\u201cUh\u2026 ah\u2026?\u201dSomething was off. The zombies suddenly stopped moving.\u201cWha\u2014what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWhy did these fuckers suddenly\u2026?\u201dThey hadn\u2019t reached the stated time limit yet. There was no reason for the zombies to freeze. And that wasn\u2019t the weirdest part\u2026\u201cChiii\u2014\u201d\u201cGugh, guwahhh\u2014\u201d\u201cGyaaack\u2014!\u201dThe zombies started to twitch, screaming in pain.They were monsters that didn\u2019t feel any pain, no matter how much their arms and legs were cut, even withstanding broken bones.Yet, suddenly they were crying in agony, falling one by one to the ground.Thud\u2014\u201cChiii\u2014\u201dThe zombies\u2019 rotten flesh started melting, as if they had been splashed with acid.\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, something\u2019s falling!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dKim MyungHoon raised his head, following his friend\u2019s observation.Lost in terror, he hadn\u2019t noticed it. There were things falling from the sky.MyungHoon reached out for one of them with the palm of his hands.It was a familiar-looking crystal.He wanted to confirm his suspicions, so he licked it.T/N: Do drugs, kids.PR/N: Wait, no, don\u2019t just lick random white crystals, kids.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cUgh, salty\u2026\u201dIt was a familiar taste.\u201c\u2026 Salt?\u201dMyungHoon looked up again.Salt was raining down from the skies.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 4\u201cGuwooooooh\u2014!\u201d\u201cGyaaah\u2014!\u201dThe cries of the zombies echoed below.It was quite pleasant, watching the zombies cry in agony. Normally, they wouldn\u2019t let out a peep, no matter how much you stabbed them or severed their limbs.[You leveled up.][You leveled up.][You leveled\u2026]A stream of notifications.YuWon mumbled to himself, pouring out the next sack of salt, \u201cIs this the last one?\u201dAt the 20 minute mark, when the number of zombies had peaked, YuWon brought the salt he had prepared to the top of the building.Jumping between the rooftops of the buildings, he dumped salt over the hoard of zombies.Swoosh\u2014The final sack of salt was unleashed.The salt crystals dispersed far away, falling on the zombies like rain drops. Once again, the zombies\u2019 heads and bodies started disintegrating.Countless level-up notifications popped up. A pleasant smile dawned on YuWon\u2019s face.\u201cThis feels great.\u201dYuWon wondered how many zombies he massacred. He knew it had to be at least in the thousands.YuWon\u2019s question was soon answered.[FINALIZING THE 1ST TUTORIAL.][SURVIVORS : 4077][Rewards for defeating enemies are being distributed.][Defeated Enemies : 1427][You have obtained 500 points.][You have achieved an unbelievable feat.][You have obtained 1000 points.][Distributing 1427 points.][You have obtained additional random stat points.][Strength increased by 1.][Constitution increased by 2.][You have obtained 1 unallocated stat point.][The 2nd Tutorial will start in 10 minutes.]\u2018A lot of people died, huh.\u2019After seeing the number of survivors, YuWon let out a sigh. Since the Hongdae sector\u2019s starting population was approximately 12,000, it meant 8,000 people died in this sector alone.\u2018I guess 4,000 survivors isn\u2019t too bad.\u2019Before, in the 1st Tutorial, more than 80% of the people hadn\u2019t made it. Especially in sectors like Hongdae, where there were a large number of zombies, it wasn\u2019t out of place for there to be no survivors.Taking that into account, 4,000 was a lot of survivors.\u2018\u2026 And I sure killed a lot.\u20191,427. That was the number of zombies YuWon killed.If he had just mindlessly cut down zombies with a knife, it would have been impossible to slaughter that many in 30 minutes.\u2018100 for taking the first kill, 500 for highest kill count, 1,000 for the unbelievable feat, and 1,427\u2014one point for each zombie.\u2019In total, it was over 3,000 points. That was an amount that should have been impossible to obtain in the 1st Tutorial.Most Tutorial participants only managed to kill one or two zombies, ten at most. So most of them started with 1-10 points.\u2018I think I started with seven points before.\u2019Since he had done sports and because he had the guts, he remembered having hunted a few zombies.Compared to back then, this was an unbelievable starting point.[Name : Kim YuWon][Level : 16][Strength : 23][Dexterity : 20][Constitution : 24][Perception : 21][Total Points : 3027][Unallocated Stat Points : 4]Level 16.The total value of his stats was 88. And if you counted the unallocated stat points, his stats totaled 92.\u2018This is a ridiculous amount to earn in the 1st Tutorial.\u2019Zombies don\u2019t give a lot of experience. No matter how many you killed, Level 3 or 4 should have been the limit in the 1st Tutorial.\u2018The next Tutorial was\u2026\u2019As YuWon stood back up\u2026\u201c> Hello, everyone!\u201dA cheerful voice in stark contrast to the situation could be heard. The voice caused the commotion below to die down, freezing people in their steps, including YuWon.\u201cWh-Who was that?\u201d\u201cWhat, did you hear that as well?\u201d\u201cI heard it too.\u201d\u201cWhere is it coming from?\u201dThe voice wasn\u2019t loud, but everyone could hear it clearly.It was different from the system\u2019s message. Unlike the robotic, toneless message, this voice felt like it belonged to an actual person.YuWon raised his head, realizing who\u2019s voice this was.\u2018A Lackey.\u2019The voice belonged to the Administrator\u2019s Lackey in charge of the Tutorial.Unlike real Administrators that were in charge of an entire floor, they were merely gophers for the Administrator, overseeing one of the tens of thousands of sectors. However, they still had to be regarded as powerful supernatural beings for now.\u2018I don\u2019t remember them appearing in the 2nd Tutorial.\u2019The reason why they weren\u2019t actually showing themselves is probably because of that person. Before, Lackeys would have started appearing only during the start of the 3rd Tutorial.\u201c> Congratulations on your survival! There are a lot of survivors here, aren\u2019t there? I\u2019m honestly shocked at how many survived.\u201dThe 1st Tutorial had two objectives. The first was to get rid of those unqualified to move onto the next Tutorial. The second was to test those qualified to move on.However, more people survived in Hongdae than the Administrator intended. The reason was simple.\u2018It\u2019s because of me.\u2019YuWon killed a zombie before everyone else, inspiring a mob mentality.There are different ways to overcome fear. One of them is watching someone else overcome it, and seeing YuWon fight gave the courage for others to also fight.There was also YuWon\u2019s massacre of the zombies with salt.\u2018At least in the places where I spread the salt, there should be a lot of survivors.\u2019Was that why, perhaps? The lackey\u2019s voice was filled with excitement, as if they had just found a new source of entertainment.\u201c> I have an announcement for the survivors. Normally, I would make this announcement after the 2nd Tutorial, but\u2026 this will be an exception because someone met the requirements too quickly.\u201dThe word \u201cannouncement\u201d brought hope to the people.\u201cAn announcement?\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cCan\u2014Can we go home now?\u201dOf course, everyone desired the same thing.To return home.Unless you were a psychopath with a few screws loose, no one would ever want to run from zombies, fight against them, or watch people die in front of them.\u201c> There is only one announcement. It is how to use your points! Now, everybody clap!\u201dThey clapped obediently, feigning excitement, but you could tell their hearts weren\u2019t in it. It wasn\u2019t a way to return home. Their disappointment was immeasurable.Still, some people were paying very close attention to what the Lackey had to say. These were your typical survivors, the people who were fast to adapt.\u201c> There are two main methods to use your points. The first is by utilizing the Shop. Now this is a really amazing thing! There are items beyond your imagination available!\u201dThe Shop.The name sounds very underwhelming, but the Shop that the Lackey mentioned had a very important role in this world.\u2018They say that you can even become a god as long as you have enough points for a reason.\u2019Levels and points.From here on out, it would be a battle for those two.\u201c> The second way is to use it as currency. You all like money, don\u2019t you? You can give or receive points by shaking hands with someone.\u201dYou could spend your points at the Shop. Additionally, you could surrender your points to someone in exchange for their cooperation or some other compensation.So, as stated by the Lackey, points were this world\u2019s currency, as well as its power and authority.\u201c> Time\u2019s up! Wasn\u2019t that a sweet break? That\u2019s it for the announcement. Now\u2026\u201d[THE 2ND TUTORIAL WILL NOW BEGIN.]\u201c> It\u2019s time for you to struggle again.\u201dThose were the last words from the Lackey.It was now the start of the 2nd Tutorial.* * *[In the center of the sector, a safe zone has been created.][Please enter the safe zone.][Once every 3 hours, 100 points will be distributed.]\u201cSafe zone?\u201d\u201cIs that it?\u201dPeople gathered in the oval that had appeared on the ground. The safe zone was a long oval divided into multiple colors. The center was purple, and the outer ends were red.\u201cHey, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cFucking hell\u2026 What in the fuck is going on?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s ChangHo?\u201d\u201cHell if I know. He probably died.\u201dMyungHoon and his friends started heading to the safe zone while chatting.Luckily, the safe zone was pretty close. They happened to have been near the center of the sector.Kim MyungHoon looked around in confusion.\u201cWhat\u2019s up? What are you looking for?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s, uh, nothing.\u201d\u201cNow that I think about it, I don\u2019t see that bastard, YuWon.\u201dPeople started gathering in the safe zone.It wasn\u2019t the strangest thing, not being able to find him in a crowd of thousands.\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t have died\u2026\u201d\u201cNo way. That guy definitely survived.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. He was fighting like an absolute beast.\u201d\u201cMaybe that\u2019s his calling?\u201dYuWon\u2019s skill was definitely the real deal.That\u2019s why Kim MyungHoon and his buddies searched for YuWon. They thought that they would be safe if they followed him.\u201cHuh?\u201dThat\u2019s when MyungHoon saw YuWon in the distance, cutting through the crowd. After a short hesitation, MyungHoon waved his hands.\u201cHey, hey! Kim YuWon!\u201dHaving heard his name, YuWon stopped in his tracks, turning his head towards him.\u201cKim MyungHoon?\u201d\u201cWhere are you going? That\u2019s the wrong way. Didn\u2019t you hear that we\u2019re supposed to stay in the safe zone?\u201dMyungHoon spoke in a friendly tone, unlike before. Things were different now. He knew that nothing good could come from being at odds with YuWon.\u2018I don\u2019t want to admit it, but being next to this bastard is the safest option.\u2019Fortunately for him, Yuwon didn\u2019t seem like he was in a bad mood.\u2018Even a guy like that should know that nothing good can come from being mad at me right now,\u2019 MyungHoon thought.YuWon should also be in need of a team. Two was better than one, and three would have a better chance of survival than two.\u2018If I just reach out to him like this\u2026\u2019\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI have somewhere I have to go,\u201d YuWon said, tapping MyungHoon\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIf you want to survive, don\u2019t try to latch onto someone. Be a good boy and wait over there. Know your place.\u201d\u201cWhat? You fucking\u2026\u201dYuWon walked away, not concerned with what MyungHoon had to say. He was headed in the complete opposite direction of the safe zone.MyungHoon was conflicted. Should he really let YuWon go?\u2018I have a feeling it\u2019ll be safest sticking with him\u2026\u2019After watching YuWon walk further away from him, MyungHoon made up his mind, heading into the safe zone.\u2018I mean, there\u2019s no way it\u2019ll be safer than the safe zone, right?\u2019And just like that, Kim MyungHoon returned to the safe zone.At that moment\u2026Bonk\u2014\u201cUgh!\u201dThe man that was walking behind MyungHoon hit his head on something, knocking him back a few steps.\u201cWha-What is this?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s blocked off!\u201d\u201cI thought you wanted us to go in there?\u201dBang, bang, bang\u2014!The people who weren\u2019t able to make it into the safe zone banged on the invisible wall.And right at that moment, words popped up on the invisible wall of the safe zone.[CAPACITY : 2038 / 2038]2,038.It was exactly half the number of survivors from the 1st Tutorial.MyungHoon, one of the last people to make it into the safe zone, became lost in thought, looking out through the invisible wall.The safe zone was created at the start of the 2nd Tutorial, and that safe zone had a maximum capacity.That would mean\u2014\u201cO-Over there!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a monster!\u201d\u2014Clearly, it meant that it was dangerous outside of the safe zone.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cWha-What is this\u2026 Aaaaaagh!\u201dMunch\u2014!Crunch, crunch\u2014Kim MyungHoon shook in fear, staring at the absolute chaos that unfolded outside the safe zone.Squirm\u2014Crunch, snap\u2014Countless bugs with gargantuan mouths shot their heads out of the ground and feasted on the people.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At first, it sounds like a pretty great mission, but the Tutorial was a trial to sort out people to enter the Tower. There was no way it would be that easy.Stab\u2014\u201cKrrrr, kishishi\u2014\u201dA bizarre, deflated cry came from the ground. It was the result of YuWon throwing his sashimi knife down.[You were the first to kill an\u300cEarthworm\u300d][You have obtained 300 points.][Distributing 2 random stat points.][Strength increased by 1.][Dexterity increased by 1.]YuWon felt good seeing the messages pop up.The Tutorial was meant to set the standard for who can enter the Tower, and for that, it gave out generous rewards to help people grow to meet that standard.After checking the messages, YuWon looked down at the bugs that shot up from the ground.\u2018Earthworms.\u2019It was a creature with a large mouth and sharp teeth. At first glance, it simply looked like a large worm.\u2018If you leave the safe zone, you become their target.\u2019That was the meaning of the safe zone. A zone that was safe from the Earthworms.And YuWon was outside of that zone.Step, step\u2014YuWon walked down the stairs. He went on high alert and closed his eyes.\u2018I can\u2019t see them anyways.\u2019Earthworms hunted their prey by digging up through the ground. Therefore, walking with your eyes open was meaningless.When you close your eyes, your senses grow sharper, no longer relying on your vision.He had to rely on his sense of hearing, his sense of touch, and his instincts that surpassed his five senses.Squirm\u2014YuWon raised his foot.\u201cGugugugu\u2014\u201d\u201cKyah\u2014\u201dCrack\u2014The Earthworm that burrowed up from the ground got its head crushed by YuWon stomping on it with perfect timing.YuWon swung the sashimi knife in his hand.Slice\u2014[You leveled up.][Strength increased by 1.][Dexterity increased by 1.][Perception increased by 1.]The Earthworm died. Its head was chopped off.YuWon leveled up, even though he only killed two of them. He must have been pretty close to leveling up.Of course, the Earthworms still gave good amounts of experience points. That was only natural. To begin with, Earthworms weren\u2019t creatures that were designed to be subjugated in the 2nd Tutorial.However, unlike zombies, Earthworms were relatively easier to kill. They were only dangerous in the sense that you couldn\u2019t see where they were coming from.Step\u2014YuWon kept descending down the stairs. They went pretty far down.\u2018Earthworms live underground. They create a cave and build their nest inside it.\u2019YuWon opened his eyes and read the sign near him.[Hongdae Station]The subway station was the largest underground area in YuWon\u2019s Tutorial sector.\u2018Earthworms can\u2019t breathe underground. They\u2019re just able to hold their breath for a long time.\u2019That\u2019s why a large nest was essential for them.\u2018That\u2019s why\u2026\u2019YuWon slowly opened his eyes.Sssk\u2014 Sss\u2014Crunch, crunch\u2014\u201cThey should be grouped up in the largest underground space.\u201dThere was no longer a need for him to keep his eyes closed. He could see nothing but Earthworms in front of him.He no longer had to pay attention to the ground, so he focused on what was in front of him.[You have discovered the hidden dungeon \u2013 \u300cHongdae Station\u300d][You have obtained 100 points.]\u201cBingo.\u201dThis was no longer the Hongdae Station YuWon once knew. It was now the home of the Earthworms whose mission was to eat the people who didn\u2019t make it into the safe zone.In other words, it had become a dungeon.\u201cShiiii\u2014\u201dCrunch\u2014\u201cGrrrr\u2014\u201dThe Earthworms discovered YuWon, squirming towards him.It was a sight to behold. Desperate to consume the prey in front of them, they must have forgotten that they were creatures that hunt from below.Stab\u2014! Slice, slash\u2014YuWon swung his knife and machete at the Earthworms that approached him.It was an experience jackpot.\u201cHow lucky for me.\u201dYuWon wasn\u2019t certain that the hidden dungeon would exist.Earthworms couldn\u2019t even be called monsters in the Tower. They were really nothing more than bugs. But even they were dangerous monsters in the Tutorial, and their ability to hide in the ground made them a great threat to those who still didn\u2019t possess proper skills or stats.\u2018What a great source of experience.\u2019Slash\u2014YuWon cut down another Earthworm that got close to him.The Earthworms in front of him were no longer threatening monsters\u2014they were simply large bugs with teeth.\u2018Now that I\u2019ve found their nest, hunting them is going to be a piece of cake.\u2019Right at that moment\u2026Plop\u2014Roll, roll, roll\u2014A marble fell out of the mouth of the Earthworm YuWon just defeated.\u201cHuh?\u201dYuWon picked up the rolling marble.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201dYuWon smiled at the unexpected surprise.\u2018This was something you could obtain in the 2nd Tutorial?\u201dIt was an interesting new find. This was undiscovered information because as far as YuWon knew, no one had managed to hunt an Earthworm before during the 2nd Tutorial.YuWon slid the marble into his pocket. He now had a reason to try even harder.\u2018I\u2019m currently Level 17.\u2019YuWon thought about his original goal for the 2nd Tutorial and contemplated the minimum requirements to achieve his goal.\u2018First, let\u2019s get to Level 20.\u2019He started walking towards the lovely bags of experience that were laid out in front of him.* * *Time crawled by slowly.There was nothing to do. The people inside the safe zone had their heads turned away from the wall, keeping their eyes closed.Outside the safe zone was hell on earth.Pieces of human flesh littered the scene, and there were countless bugs snacking on corpses.\u201cI can\u2019t even kill a single cockroach\u2026\u201d\u201cRather than getting mauled by one of those things, I\u2019d rather bite my tongue and kill myself.\u201d\u201cThey\u2014they can\u2019t get in here, right?\u201d\u201cN-No way\u2026 They said this place was safe.\u201dEven though there were 2,000 people present, there was little talking going on. They feared that if they were even just a little too loud, the Earthworms might pop out from beneath them.The safe zone was quite quiet. It couldn\u2019t be helped, since everyone was cautious when speaking even a single word.Even more time passed.[3 hours have passed.][You have obtained 100 points.]\u201cWow, points.\u201d\u201cSo this is like money?\u201d\u201cIs 100 points a lot?\u201dKim MyungHoon and his gang also became interested in points.One was able to buy items from The Shop with points. Up until now, they only had two or three points, but now they could afford some items from The Shop.That\u2019s when it occurred.[THE RED REGION WILL BE DEACTIVATED.][CAPACITY : 1867 / 1500][When the max capacity is surpassed, people will be randomly expelled from the safe zone.]Along with the message, a few people started moving.Zzzt\u2014\u201cWhoa, what the\u2014?\u201d\u201cNo, please don\u2019t!\u201dZzzzzt\u2014An invisible force dragged people outside the zone.The ground of the safe zone that was red returned to its original color. Those places were no longer safe, and the Earthworms once again reared their heads.Crunch\u2014Snap\u2014\u201cAhhhh!\u201dThe people that were dragged outside and the people that were sitting on the outer edge of the zone were attacked.There was nowhere to run.No matter how far you ran, it would only be a matter of time before you got swallowed up by the bugs.\u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d\u201cThis thing shrank?\u201d\u201cI had my suspicions, but\u2026\u201dEveryone thought that the colors on the ground probably meant something. And among those people, a few of them had considered the possibility that the safe zone might shrink over time. Kim MyungHoon was one of them.\u2018So how small is this thing going to shrink?\u2019The inner center was purple. And the outer parts of the zone had become orange.\u2018And how many people can actually fit in the center?\u2019MyungHook checked how much time he had left.[REMAINING TIME : 02 : 57 : 11]2 hours and 57 minutes.So when time runs out\u2026\u201cMo-Move!\u201d\u201cTha\u2014that\u2019s my spot!\u201d\u201cFuck off! Do you want to die that much? I\u2019ll kill you if that\u2019s what you want!\u201d\u201cGet out of the way! Why are you blocking my way?!\u201dIn an instant, the entire place erupted into chaos.MyungHoon quickly came up with a plan on the spot.\u201cEveryone, quiet!\u201d he got up from his spot and shouted.For a short second, silence returned. MyungHoon calmed his fast-beating heart and opened his mouth.\u201cStarting now, we\u2026\u201dThere was a line dividing orange and yellow. MyungHoon continued his speech while staring at that line.\u201cNeed to decide who to kill in order to live\u2026\u201dGulp\u2014It was a cruel thing to say. But it couldn\u2019t be helped.\u2018We can\u2019t all be in the center.\u2019If that happened, some people would be randomly tossed outside.That meant\u2014\u201cI will\u2026\u201dMyungHoon pointed at the very old man closest to him, a rare sight in Hongdae.\u201c\u2026 Kill this old man.\u201d\u2014That in order to live, you had to kill someone else. That was the central conflict of the 2nd Tutorial.* * *Crack\u2014!The axe split apart the Earthworm\u2019s head. The charging Earthworm flopped dead once its skull was cracked.Splat\u2014Woosh\u2014YuWon spun around full force, swinging the machete that was in his other hand. In one swing, the two Earthworms that were attacking from behind got their heads chopped off.[You have leveled up.][Strength increased by 1.][Constitution increased by 1.][Perception increased by 1.][You have achieved Level 20.][A new stat \u300cArcane Power\u300d has been unlocked.]With the level up, the message that YuWon was waiting for could be heard.\u201c\u2026 Finally.\u201dYuWon was breathing heavily. Even though his Constitution stat had increased greatly, he couldn\u2019t help being exhausted after moving around for three hours.Fortunately, with the level up, his Constitution increased again, along with unlocking a new stat. This made his body feel lighter than before.Plop\u2014Roll, roll, roll\u2014Another marble fell on the ground. YuWon put this one away as well. His bag had become heavy, filled to the brim with marbles.[Name : Kim YuWon][Level : 20][Strength : 28][Dexterity : 26][Constitution : 27][Perception : 24][Arcane Power : 13][Total Points : 3527][Unallocated Stat Points : 5]His stats had improved a lot. Most of his stats were in the mid-20s, and he still had the unallocated stat points he had obtained as a reward. On top of that, he unlocked a new stat by reaching Level 20.YuWon\u2019s stats already far exceeded what should have been possible in the 2nd Tutorial.\u2018Three random stat points and one unallocated stat point from hunting Earthworms\u2026\u201dIt wasn\u2019t a bad haul. However, it fell slightly short of his expectations.\u2018Well, until I defeat\u00a0that\u00a0guy, I shouldn\u2019t expect a better reward.\u2019YuWon used the unallocated points he had been saving up.[Applying unallocated stat points.][Arcane Power increased by 5.]He invested all the unallocated stat points he had been saving up in Arcane Power.Other people would have to work pretty hard to figure out what the Arcane Power stat was. YuWon, on the other hand, already knew the answer.Among the five stats, none of them were as important as Arcane Power.[Arcane Power : 18]\u201cNot bad.\u201dYuWon closed his eyes for a second and nodded his head, feeling the Arcane Power flow inside him.YuWon had started with 13 Arcane Power. It was something he only discovered later, but 13 was unprecedentedly high.Someone who was untalented usually started with 5-6. Talented people generally had 9-11 as their starting stat.And a very small minority started with 12 stat points. They were described as having received the Tower\u2019s blessing.And here was YuWon. He started with 13 points and had now achieved 18 Arcane Power.\u201cHey.\u201dYuWon looked around, standing on top of all the Earthworm corpses.\u201cYou\u2019re watching right?\u201d he shouted into thin air.A moment later.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2014 How did you know?\u201dA finger-sized Pierrot.* The Administrator\u2019s Lackey appeared in front of YuWon\u2019s eyes.*PR/N: Pierrots are a type of clown recognizable by the tear(s) painted on their faces.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 6Chapter 6YuWon boasted once the Lackey appeared, \u201cI happen to know I\u2019m pretty amazing. Besides, isn\u2019t it boring over there?\u201dThe only special thing in the safe zone was the massacre that occurred every three hours. Of course, even that would be entertaining for a Lackey, but Yuwon knew that the Lackey would find him more interesting.\u201c\u2014 Well, you\u2019re right about that. Thank you! You\u2019ve made my boring job a little bit fun! But wow, you really reached Level 20 already?\u201d\u201cI was lucky.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Lucky you say\u2026 People who say that tend to be the scariest.\u201dThe Lackey cackled as he spoke. Among all the Tutorial stages, the 2nd Tutorial was the most boring one for Lackeys.\u201c\u2014 So why did you call me?\u201d\u201cThe Shop.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Oh! You want to buy an item?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d YuWon shook his head.\u201cI want to buy some skills.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Skills?\u201dThe Lackey was surprised by YuWon\u2019s answer. It then grinned as it opened up the Shop.\u201c\u2014 You\u2019re probably the first person ever to buy a skill in the 2nd Tutorial.\u201dSkills referred to the countless special abilities\u00a0that existed within the Tower. And the minimum requirement to use these skills was unlocking the Arcane Power stat by reaching Level 20.An endless catalogue appeared in front of YuWon\u2019s eyes. There was nothing that wasn\u2019t sold in the Shop.To start with, there were some \u201cuseful\u201d weapons and equipment you could purchase with 100-200 points.Anything that you could call a real item cost over 500 points. And among them\u2026\u2018Here it is.\u2019After scrolling through the exceedingly long list, he finally found the skills.The cheapest one was 1,000 points. Some even cost as much as 100,000 points.\u201cIs this all the skills you have? Don\u2019t you have any others?\u201d\u201c\u2014 Those are all the skills you may purchase during the Tutorial. Why? Is there something specific you\u2019re looking for?\u201d\u201cNo. Not really.\u201dBeing noticed was fine. Letting the Lackey know that he knew all the items in the Tower was not.It wasn\u2019t good to be under the eyes of the Lackey for too long. If the Lackey found out that YuWon held information on the Tutorial and the Tower, the difficulty of the Tutorial could potentially change.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ll go with this one.\u201dYuWon selected a skill.[You have spent 2000 points.][You have obtained the skill \u2013 Monkey\u2019s Eyes][Total Points : 1527]YuWon\u2019s eyes changed to a golden color.The Lackey was confused by his decision and transformation.\u201c\u2014 Monkey\u2019s Eyes? That\u2019s not a very good skill, is it?\u201d\u201cThe name sounds cool.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Hm\u2026\u201dThe Lackey\u2019s face soured. It appeared quite disappointed.It couldn\u2019t be helped. Unlike what YuWon said, not only did [Monkey\u2019s Eyes] not actually sound cool, but its effects weren\u2019t very useful either. More than anything, the skill was too difficult for someone who hadn\u2019t entered the Tower to utilize properly.YuWon quickly picked another skill.\u201cAlso, this one.\u201d[You have spent 1500 points.][You have obtained the skill \u2013 Basic Arcane Sword][Total Points : 27]The Lackey nodded his head.\u201c\u2014 What a fine selection. [Arcane Sword] is a pretty useful skill that makes up for a lack of attack power for contestants during the early stages of the Tutorial.\u201dThe Lackey was right. That was actually the reason why he picked this skill.\u2018And it\u2019s also cheap.\u2019He didn\u2019t see a reason to use his remaining points.As YuWon walked away, the Lackey smiled.\u201c\u2014 Have an enjoyable time. I have great expectations of you.\u201dUpon hearing the Lackey say that, YuWon paused his step for a brief second.Expectations.Knowing what that meant, YuWon looked back in the direction of the now vanished Lackey.Special Administrative Target.This refers to participants that really stand out during the Tutorial. They\u2019re marked and observed to make sure that they don\u2019t commit any foul play.\u2018Hopefully it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019It was entirely his abilities that got him to this point already in the 2nd Tutorial.No one should be able to find any evidence of the Tower, a Ranker, or another Lackey helping YuWon cheat.If there was one thing that worried him, it was being a Returner.Being a Returner gave him a huge advantage. With or without the stats, it couldn\u2019t be helped that the Tutorial felt easy when he held information and experience from the future.Though Yuwon wasn\u2019t too worried about that.\u2018There\u2019s no way an Administrator could know.\u2019The \u300cClock Movement\u300d was an item crafted by Chronos, Mimir, and Odin.They were beings that fought against the Outer Gods that brought destruction to the Tower. And Chronos, who was essential in crafting the item, had his existence erased as the penalty for using the \u300cClock Movement.\u300dNot even the real Administrator, let alone its Lackey, should be able to find out about the existence of this item.\u201cHaaaah\u2014\u201d YuWon let out a deep sigh.The Arcane Power stat and two skills.He had achieved the minimum requirements he desired from the 2nd Tutorial.[Monkey\u2019s Eyes]\u15cc Rank : F\u15cc Proficiency : 0.00%\u15cc Eyes that once belonged to a monkey on Mount Huaguo.**T/N: It\u2019s the mountain that Son OhGong was born in.\u15cc When activated, it increases your vision and fortifies your five senses.[Basic Arcane Sword]\u15cc Rank : F\u15cc Proficiency : 0.00%\u15cc It envelops your sword in Arcane Power. Depending on its usage, it can become an excellent trusty sword.The explanations for both spells were simple.[Arcane Sword] was a skill that became more versatile depending on your Arcane Power stat and your control over it. It was a pretty useful skill to use in the Tutorial and the early floors of the Tower.On the other hand, [Monkey\u2019s Eyes] was a skill that one wouldn\u2019t be able to figure out its use simply from the explanation.\u201cThey really have the audacity to sell something like this.\u201dEven though he had just bought it, 2,000 points made it a hard purchase to swallow for YuWon. Despite that, he had selected it over other skills.YuWon activated the skill. His five senses became sharper, and he could see further than he could before. The sounds, the presence, even the air touching his skin\u2014everything felt different.It wasn\u2019t a bad skill.You could never have too many skills. Therefore, there was no such thing as a bad skill.\u2018But if this is it, it\u2019s definitely overpriced.\u2019It couldn\u2019t be helped. This was a skill that he had to start raising his proficiency in by using it as much as he could, starting now.\u2018So this is that guy\u2019s eyes\u2026\u2019[REMAINING TIME : 00 : 29 : 58]YuWon checked how much time remained. There was about 30 minutes remaining until the orange safe zone disappeared.\u2018I have plenty of time.\u2019Having regained the Arcane Power he lost, his body felt lighter than a feather.Compared to how much Arcane Power he had before, it was smaller than even a speck of dust, but there was a clear difference between having it and not.Shhiii, shiiirik\u2014Crunch, CRUNCH\u2014Walking deeper into the subway station, he was able to find more Earthworms. It was an even larger swarm than earlier. It was overpopulated like an ant colony.Vooom\u2014The machete in YuWon\u2019s hand emitted a faint blue glow. It was the effect of the new skill, [Arcane Sword.]\u201cI knew you guys would be here.\u201dShhiii, shiiirik\u2014\u201cCraaa\u2014\u201dMunch, munch\u2014There was a gigantuan bug, much larger than any other Earthworm. Her body was two meters thick and close to 15 meters in length.She was feasting on human torsos, food brought to her by the other Earthworms.\u201cMother Worm.\u201dThe mother of the Earthworms.She laid countless eggs, and the Earthworms that hatched from those eggs hunted food for her.She was the boss of this dungeon and the 2nd Tutorial.Crack, crunch\u2014\u201cKiyaaaah\u2014!\u201dAll the Earthworms screeched upon noticing YuWon\u2019s presence.YuWon estimated there to be about two or three hundred of them.The squirming Earthworms weren\u2019t very threatening, but there were far too many of them. They literally covered the entire ground.\u2018I don\u2019t have time to deal with all of them.\u2019YuWon got a running start before jumping into the air.Leap\u2014Upon landing, he slayed the nearby Earthworms in a flash before dashing towards the Mother Worm.Slash, splat\u2014\u2018I\u2019m going to kill the Mother Worm in one go.\u2019The machete buffed with [Arcane Sword] cut down the Earthworms with ease. And luckily for YuWon, the Mother Worm had strong attachments to her offspring.\u201cKiyaaah\u2014!\u201dThud\u2014The ginormous Mother Worm started moving. Funnily enough, her fury crushed her own babies. YuWon let out a small laugh at the sight.\u201cYou really lack brains, huh.\u201dThe speed at which the Mother Worm approached him was no joke. When she got in range, the Mother Worm swallowed up YuWon in a single bite.Crunch\u2014!The teeth collided into each other, making an ominous sound.\u201cGuurugh\u2014?\u201dNothing was caught between her teeth. As the Mother Worm let out a confused cry\u2026Crack\u2014!\u201cGiyaaaaagh\u2014!\u201dThe Mother Worm howled.It was due to the pain she felt on her head.\u201cThank you for coming to me.\u201dSplat\u2014 Stab\u2014STAB, STAB, STAB\u2014YuWon repeatedly dug his axe and machete into her head. As if he was mountain climbing, YuWon quickly got on top of the Mother Worm\u2019s body.\u201cGyaaaah\u2014!\u201dThe Mother Worm started to seriously thrash around. Realizing that YuWon got on top of her, she immediately rolled over.Boom\u2014She exposed her belly.At that moment, YuWon\u2019s machete pierced her stomach.Splash\u2014!From the Mother Worm\u2019s wound, a fountain of blood erupted.Wooom\u2014The blue light around the axe and machete shone brightly.While her belly was exposed, it was his chance.YuWon mercilessly swung his weapon.Slice, splat\u2014Swoosh\u2014!The Mother Worm\u2019s belly got torn and shredded.\u201cKyaaaaaaagh\u2014!\u201dA cry of pain.While squirming in pain, the Mother Worm bared her teeth at YuWon again.\u201cKyaaah\u2014!\u201dSlash\u2014!YuWon wrapped his axe in Arcane Power and split the Mother Worm\u2019s head in half.Boom\u2014* * *[REMAINING TIME : 00 : 01 : 12]There wasn\u2019t a lot of time left.MyungHoon could see the old man he sent outside.\u2018Fuck, I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u2019As a human being, he at least had an ounce of guilt. There was no way he could feel nothing while watching the old man that was exiled because of him.\u201cP-Please save me\u2026\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t right! How can you all do this, knowing that we\u2019ll die\u2026!As the time approached, the pleas of the people pushed outside grew louder.Kim MyungHoon bit his lip before shouting, \u201cShut up!\u201dThe people who tried to force themselves back in flinched because of his shout and glare.While pointing with the knife he bought from the Shop for 100 points, he spoke, \u201cLet\u2019s not do that. Didn\u2019t we make a promise? And we all agreed to it.\u201d\u201cWhen did we agree to it? When?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! We\u2026\u201d\u201cThe majority! Everyone except you guys!\u201d MyungHoon said.He held his knife even closer to them. The man trying to come back into the yellow area flinched and backed off.\u201cSo if you come back in, we\u2019ll kill you ourselves. Understood?\u201dEveryone in the yellow area nodded in agreement.

Either die to the people here after crossing the yellow line or die to the monsters by staying in the orange.[00 : 00 : 30]The old man closed his eyes.In 30 seconds, the monsters would shoot up from the ground and tear him apart.[00 : 00 : 17]Crunch, crunch\u2014Earthworms appeared right outside the orange safe zone.These bastards knew it too.

    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 7Chapter 7YuWon sat down on top of the Mother Worm\u2019s corpse. He was surrounded by a mountain of Earthworm corpses. It was the result of fighting against them for a whole hour.\u201c\u2014 Wow, you actually managed to slaughter all of them.\u201dHe heard a voice. It was the Lackey.YuWon rubbed on the ointment he had in his pocket and tossed it aside.\u201cIt was a bit of a struggle.\u201dHundreds and hundreds of Earthworms. Even though they could only crawl on the ground, they were still the ones that guarded the Mother Worm. Even YuWon couldn\u2019t help getting a bit wounded while hunting them all.\u201c\u2014 Would you like for me to heal you?\u201d\u201cWill that count as one of the rewards?\u201d\u201c\u2014 Of course.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to refuse. A tiny injury like this can be healed just by raising my Constitution.\u201dThe Lackey seemed disappointed by YuWon\u2019s response. It was probably scheming to reduce YuWon\u2019s rewards, even if it was just a small bit, by using this as an excuse.\u2018That took a while.\u2019After the carnage was over, YuWon had waited in that spot for over 30 minutes.During that time, YuWon treated himself, restoring his health and stamina. He thought the Lackey would have visited him sooner, but it took quite a bit longer before it appeared.\u2018That should mean there was a long discourse between the Lackeys.\u2019\u201c\u2014 First, let me applaud you. How could a normal human being get to this point in just the 2nd Tutorial\u2026?\u201dThe Lackeys\u2019 job was managing the Tutorial. In that role, they had to adequately reward or penalize beings that acted outside of the Tutorial\u2019s design.YuWon hunted the 2nd Tutorial\u2019s boss, the Mother Worm. It was the matriarch of the Earthworms and the monster that preserved the ecosystem of the 2nd Tutorial.However, YuWon killed that Mother Worm. He fully cleared the 2nd Tutorial, going against the design of the level.\u201cAnd the reward is\u2026?\u201dThere was no preset reward in the Tutorial\u2019s system for hunting the Mother Worm. It was only natural. She wasn\u2019t a creature that should have been possible to hunt in the 2nd Tutorial. It was possible to defeat an Earthworm if one was lucky, but the Mother Worm was a class of monster that required being in at least the 5th Tutorial to even encounter.\u201c\u2014 It seems to me that you already understand this world.\u201d\u201cSomewhat. After all I\u2019ve done, it would be weirder for me to not realize that special actions get rewarded.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Is that so? Most people never actually figure that out. Though, I guess you do seem a bit special.\u201dThe conversation started dragging on.YuWon asked the Lackey in an annoyed tone, \u201cSo, what\u2019s my reward?\u201d\u201c\u2014 You may pick between three things.\u201d\u201cWhat are they?\u201d\u201c\u2014 The first option is the right to skip to the 5th Tutorial. Of course, this option will include the information and rewards for the 3rd and 4th Tutorials.\u201dIt was a useless reward. YuWon had no intention to skip through the Tutorials. And the 3rd Tutorial was especially critical in his plans. It might be a good proposition for others, but YuWon had no interest in it.\u2018They must think they\u2019re being clever.\u2019The Lackeys probably thought that the 3rd and 4th Tutorial would be of little value to YuWon. It wasn\u2019t rocket science. If he could achieve this much in just the 2nd Tutorial, he should be able to breeze through the 3rd and 4th Tutorial. Because of that, the Lackeys were eager to send him to a later Tutorial.YuWon silently waited for the Lackey to explain the next reward.\u201c\u2014 The second reward is points. No matter the world, isn\u2019t money the best? And in this world, points are money.\u201dThe Lackey made a circle with his index finger and thumb.T/N: In Korea, the circle hand gesture means \u201cmoney\u201d as well as \u201cOK.\u201dPoints equated to money and power. This wasn\u2019t a bad reward.\u201cAnd the last option?\u201d\u201c\u2014 The final one is connecting you with Olympus.\u201dYuWon narrowed his eyes.This was completely unexpected.\u201c\u2026 Olympus?\u201dFor Olympus to be mentioned by the mid-level management of the Tutorial\u2026\u201c\u2014 You wouldn\u2019t know this, but the Tutorial is merely the starting point. In the grand Tower, there are huge organizations as well as countless beings with god-like powers.\u201dThis was something he never expected in a million years. This was forbidden knowledge for participants of the Tutorial.Yet, for a Lackey of all people to reveal this information\u2026\u201c\u2014 I will recommend you to Olympus. Olympus is one of the organizations that rule the Tower. If you are sponsored by them, you should be safe in the Tower, once you\u2019ve completed the Tutorial.\u201dYuWon let out a small laugh. Instead of a Lackey, it was acting more like a recruiter for Olympus.\u201cOlympus you say\u2026\u201dChronos, the one who sent YuWon to the past, was a Ranker that belonged to Olympus. And as the Lackey described, Olympus was one of the major factions that ruled the Tower. If YuWon could borrow their power, he\u2019d be able to climb the Tower even faster and safer, but\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll go with the second option.\u201dYuWon did not select the third reward.[Distributing reward.][You have obtained 10000 points.]It was a simple but enormous reward. Ten thousand points. It was an unimaginable amount to earn in the Tutorial.YuWon was satisfied with his reward, but he was the only one who was happy.\u201c\u2014 Are you being serious right now?\u201dThe Lackey was clearly displeased by YuWon\u2019s decision, making an extremely sour face. However, YuWon had no intention to change his decision.\u201cI am.\u201d\u201c\u2014 Please rethink this. Since you haven\u2019t used your points yet, I\u2019ll give you a mulligan. I\u2019m sure you made this decision because you don\u2019t really know Olympus very well, but you shouldn\u2019t regret it later, and\u2014\u201d\u201cHey, Lackey.\u201d\u201c\u2014 ?\u201d\u201cCan you just do your job right as the Administrator\u2019s gopher? Are you not worried what might happen if the Administrator catches you working for Oympus?\u201dThe Lackey\u2019s eyes widened from YuWon\u2019s statement.It was because the word \u201cAdministrator\u201d came out of YuWon\u2019s mouth.\u201cThis right now, the other Lackeys didn\u2019t agree to it, right? And it most definitely wouldn\u2019t have been approved by the Administrator.\u201d\u201c\u2014 How do you\u2026?\u201d\u201cHave the other Lackeys also received a similar deal? I wonder if they\u2019re all bought out by the same place? Or maybe some are with the Heavenly Realm? Deva perhaps? Lemegeton even?\u201d\u201c\u2014 You\u2014what in the world are you?\u201dThe Lackey\u2019s voice was shaking.It was something that had never happened before. At least within the Tutorial, a Lackey held absolute power and authority. Such a powerful Lackey was now shaking in front of a mere participant.YuWon looked a bit bitter as he spoke. \u201cThanks, Lackey.\u201dIt didn\u2019t matter which faction bought out the Lackeys. The Tutorial was a place that needed to be separate from the Tower. Yet out of everyone, Olympus being connected to the Tutorial was a problem he could not overlook.\u201cThanks to you flapping your mouth, I\u2019ve found one more thing I have to do here.\u201dYou could do anything in this world as long as you had the points. Among the methods of using points in the Tower, this was one of them.[Requesting a meeting with the Administrator.][Paying 1000 points.]Guoooooh\u2014Rumble, rumble\u2014The subway station shook violently.It felt like the whole world was falling apart. Trembling, the Lackey looked at YuWon.\u201c\u2014 Y-You! What did you just\u2026\u201d\u201cI requested a meeting with the Administrator.\u201dYuWon stared at the spatial disruption.[The Administrator approved your request.]\u201c\u2026 He should arrive soon.\u201dYuWon was a participant that outshined the others in this Tutorial. The Administrator would be at least a little interested in him, which is why his request was approved. And now\u2026\u201c\u25b7 A request for a meeting in the Tutorial\u2026\u201dA presence so powerful that it made one\u2019s body feel like it being pressed down revealed himself in the subway station.\u201c\u25b7 For a mere thousand points. Hahaha!\u201dAmused, the Administrator let out a comical laugh. Of course he found it hilarious.In the Tower, not even tens of thousands of points were enough to meet the Administrator, but in the Tutorial, for just a thousand points, it was a possibility.Even though the value of points in the Tutorial and Tower differed, it was still a funny situation for the Administrator.\u2018The Tutorial\u2019s Administrator, a.k.a. the Tower\u2019s bottom floor Administrator.\u2019The Tutorial was a trail of sorts. And the Tutorial\u2019s Administrator was a being that weeded out people fit to enter the Tower. That\u2019s why some also called him \u201cthe bottom floor Admin.\u201dAn Administrator was a being that ruled over a floor. No one knew their true nature, but they held powers that rivaled the top Rankers.\u201c\u2014 Ad-Administrator\u2026\u201dThe Lackey\u2019s voice trembled at the appearance of the Administrator.Yet, the Administrator looked shabby in comparison to his intimidating presence and deep voice. He looked like a very tall beggar with a long beard. That was all that could be said to describe the Administrator\u2019s appearance.Ignoring the Lackey, the Administrator took long strides and stood in front of YuWon.\u201c\u25b7 So, you wanted a meeting? With me?\u201dThe Administrator suppressed his presence. If he hadn\u2019t held back his presence, YuWon would have had a hard time even breathing in front of him.\u201cMy name is Kim YuWon. I am a participant of the Tutorial.\u201c\u25b7 Hehehe. I\u2019ve heard. So, you killed over 1,000 undead in the 1st Tutorial?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhen my underlings verified the result, they said they didn\u2019t discover any cheating or abnormalities. They weren\u2019t wrong, which is what really surprised me.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t just the Lackey that had taken an interest in YuWon. The ruler of the floor, the Administrator, also couldn\u2019t help being interested in YuWon.\u201c\u25b7 How did you know of my existence? And how did you figure out how to request a meeting?\u201dThe Administrator had many questions.How did YuWon know about the existence of the Administrator and even how to request a meeting? Neither pieces of information should have been available in the 2nd Tutorial. Also, why did YuWon request a meeting with him?\u201cI know about the law of the Tutorial.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 The law? What would that be?\u201d\u201cThe law that all information regarding the Tutorial must be obtained by the participant\u2019s own abilities and not be given by the Administrator or the Tower.\u201dYuWon continued speaking while staring up at the giant figure that exceeded two meters in height. \u201cA law that you decided.\u201dThat was YuWon\u2019s answer. He was stating that all the information he knew was obtained with his own abilities.The Administrator looked into YuWon\u2019s eyes.There were no beings that could lie to the Administrator in the Tutorial. He had the power to discern truth or lies from all spoken words, at least in the Tutorial that he managed.\u201c\u25b7 \u2026 Is that so.\u201dThe Administrator retracted his doubts. It didn\u2019t matter how he found out about this information. As long as no one had assisted YuWon, there weren\u2019t any issues.YuWon shifted the Administrator\u2019s attention.\u201cInstead, I think the Tower\u2019s interference exists over here.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about the Lackey.\u201dThe Lackey, who was biding their time, smiled faintly at the Administrator, letting out nervous laughter.It tried to silently communicate to YuWon to please keep it a secret. It was no use though.\u201cOlympus made contact with the Lackeys.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Olympus?\u201d\u201cYes. It talked about rewarding me with a sponsorship from Olympus.\u201dThe Administrator\u2019s face became red with anger.He looked over at the Lackey to confirm the truth. And as soon as their eyes locked with each other\u2026Whoosh\u2014Crush\u2014!The Administrator swung his arm, demolishing the Lackey\u2019s body in an instant.Drip\u2014The Lackey with the appearance of a pierrot got torn apart, dripping blood.The Administrator mumbled as he shook the blood off his hand.\u201c\u25b7 Those fucking Olympus bastards\u2026 On top of everything else, they dare spread their influence here?\u201dThe Administrator\u2019s eyes turned red.The interference by Olympus must have really displeased him.After grinding his teeth for a moment, staring down at the spot where the Lackey\u2019s corpse laid, the Administrator looked back at YuWon.\u201c\u25b7\u00a0Thank you. Thanks to you, I can now cut away the rotten parts.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t an idiot. The Administrator knew that it wasn\u2019t happenstance for there to be a Lackey connected to Olympus. There were probably other Lackeys in the same boat.YuWon couldn\u2019t hold back his joy at receiving the Administrator\u2019s thanks.\u201cThe second law of the Tutorial.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 \u2026?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2018During the Tutorial, all achievements by a participant must be compensated by a reward of equal merit.\u2019\u201dYuWon looked over at the Lackey that the Administrator killed.\u201cFair and square, I paid my points to call you over, and through you, I \u2018hunted\u2019 a Lackey.\u201dYuWon looked the Administrator in the eyes.\u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 8Chapter 8After hearing YuWon\u2019s words, the Administrator was speechless.After a short pause, he laughed with a large smile.\u201c\u25b7 Fwahaha! Once again, you are right.\u201dThe Administrator stroked his beard, lowering his head to look YuWon straight in the eye.\u201c\u25b7 You\u2019re the first participant to ever kill a Lackey in the 2nd Tutorial. Huh. I guess there\u2019s a first time for everything. Fwahahaha!\u201dThe Administrator laughed bizarrely. Now that he finally understood the situation, he was flabbergasted.YuWon was right. He had requested the meeting with the Administrator, and he had told the Administrator the Lackey\u2019s secret. As a result, the Administrator killed the Lackey. Everything went as YuWon thought it would.\u201c\u25b7 You may not have killed him with your own hands, but it is your achievement.\u201dNormally, a Lackey\u2019s death should have been impossible.Lackeys were the mid-level management of the Tutorial that acted as proxies for the Administrator. All the participants in a Tutorial put together couldn\u2019t defeat a single Lackey. A Lackey\u2019s power was close to that of a Ranker.And one of those Lackeys had just died.Although it might have died at the hands of the Administrator, it was, without a doubt, all according to YuWon\u2019s plan.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 So what do you desire? You seem to already possess plenty of points. Let\u2019s see, what would be a fitting reward\u2026\u201dThe Administrator became lost in thought. As this was the first time a Lackey was killed, he seemed unable to decide on an appropriate reward.YuWon patiently awaited the Administrator\u2019s decision.The Administrator sat down on the floor, crossing his legs, getting lost deep in thought. After five minutes, he jumped up in an epiphany.\u201c\u25b7 He at least deserves this much.\u201dThe Administrator held out his hand towards YuWon.Hand contact. It was the common method of trading points in the Tutorial and the Tower. However, the Administrator of the Tutorial had no reason to use this method to simply give out points. He could even transfer skills without any physical contact.\u2018Why is this necessary?\u2019The Administrator held his hand up. Without understanding his intent, YuWon grabbed it.In that moment\u2026[You have obtained the skill \u2013 Master of Mana.][Your mana recovery rate slightly increases.][Your resistance to mana slightly increases.][Your sensitivity to mana slightly increases.][Your Arcane Power increased by 5.]With the numerous messages that popped up, a blue light enveloped YuWon\u2019s body for a brief moment before fading.\u2018What\u2026?\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes widened.The Administrator let out a small laugh at YuWon\u2019s reaction.\u201c\u25b7 Fuhaha. We shall meet again, once the 3rd Tutorial is over. Right now, I have some house cleaning to do.\u201dGuuuuuuh\u2014Once again, the inside of the station rumbled.Just as when he appeared, the Administrator tumultuously tore apart the fabric of space before vanishing. YuWon blankly stared at the spot where he vanished before he checked his new skill.[Master of Mana]\u15cc Rank : S+\u15cc Proficiency : 0.00%\u15cc One of the Authorities of an Administrator, a being that rules over mana.\u15cc +10% mana recovery rate\u15cc +10% mana resistance\u15cc Increased sensitivity to mana.\u15cc Increased authority over mana.An S+ rank skill. And it was one of the Authorities of an Administrator.\u201cIsn\u2019t this too much for a reward in the Tutorial?\u201dEven though he \u201ckilled\u201d a Lackey, YuWon wasn\u2019t expecting a reward this great. He would have been satisfied with an A-rank skill or item.The Authority of an Administrator. Even YuWon has never heard of such a skill.\u2018Authority over mana, you say\u2026\u2019Mana was everything in the Tower. The power to control that mana, Arcane Power, was the biggest factor in deciding who the weak and the strong were.To rule over that mana\u2026 It was an ability fit to be called an \u201cauthority.\u201d\u201cI probably can\u2019t use it properly yet.\u201dIt was a brand new type of skill, but YuWon knew how to use these kinds of skills well.The skill might not be overpowered by itself, but it synergized well with any skill, boosting the user\u2019s abilities. Depending on their proficiency, the usefulness of their skills could be night and day.\u2018Maybe I should be thankful to Olympus.\u2019Shwoo, shwaaah\u2014A blue sphere gathered on top of YuWon\u2019s palm. The sphere wasn\u2019t smooth. It continuously morphed irregularly. It was proof that he wasn\u2019t able to properly condense mana yet.It was a crude Mana Blast.\u2018A Mana Blast during the second Tutorial\u2026\u2019YuWon stared at the sphere in his palm. It wasn\u2019t able to maintain a proper form yet, but it was undoubtedly a Mana Blast.YuWon\u2019s Arcane Power stat was barely at 26. It took hunting the Mother Worm, getting 2 lucky random stats, and using all his unallocated stat points.Mana Blast was a technique that required at least 40 Arcane Power with advanced control over mana.Though unstable, YuWon was able to create a Mana Blast with only 26 Arcane Power. Part of it was YuWon having exceptional control over mana, but it still would have been impossible without the effects of [Master of Mana.]Boom\u2014!The unstable Mana Blast exploded. The power inside it blew apart like shrapnel, lightly damaging the ground around him.He clenched his fist.\u201cThis is pretty nice.\u201dYuWon had a higher goal than simply making it through the Tutorial in one piece. He didn\u2019t want to climb the Tower and become a Ranker because he desired power or wealth.\u2018But it\u2019s still far from enough.\u2019Outer Gods\u00a0were beings that perfectly fit the definition of omnipotent. Regaining his old powers was far from enough to fight them again. He needed far more cards to play against them than he had now. Far, far more.* * *When he received his reward from the Administrator, there were approximately 14 hours left until the 2nd Tutorial was finalized.YuWon spent that entire time hunting.Earthworms infested more than just the subway station. They populated any underground space. So YuWon killed time by clearing out one basement after another. He didn\u2019t have a choice, since the only monsters in the 2nd Tutorial were Earthworms.Near the end of the 2nd Tutorial\u2026[Name : Kim YuWon][Level : 26][Strength : 33][Dexterity : 29][Constitution : 30][Perception : 26][Arcane Power: 30][Total Points : 10027][Unallocated Stat Points : 0]This was the result of 13 hours of hard work.After hitting Level 21 by killing the Mother Worm, he grinded 5 levels in 13 hours.\u2018Worms aren\u2019t enough anymore.\u2019Level 26.At that level, not just YuWon, but anyone would have an easy time hunting an Earthworm.In the Tutorial, the stronger your opponent is, the greater reward. So, logically, hunting monsters that were far weaker than him resulted in stunted growth.\u2018Thankfully, the 2nd Tutorial is close to being finalized\u2026\u2019One hour remained.YuWon decided to go back above ground.When the timer ran out and the 2nd Tutorial ended, a bonus reward was given to those inside the safe zone. YuWon wasn\u2019t certain, but it was entirely possible that those outside the safe zone could get disqualified from receiving the reward.Tmp, tmp\u2014YuWon took heavy steps towards the surface.A whole day passed by while YuWon was underground, and it was night time once again.In the distance, he saw it.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201dIt was the safe zone that had stopped shrinking. Inside the circle, the people were split into two large groups. They were loudly arguing with each other about something.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying let\u2019s wait a bit longer! Hongdae became such a mess. Do you really think the government will do nothing about this? If we just wait one more day\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in denial! Our world has changed. Not just Hongdae, but everywhere!\u201d\u201cHo-How can you believe that?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear the explanation up \u2018til now? Didn\u2019t you hear what sector this was? Do you really think this is the only place like this?!\u201d\u201cEven if that\u2019s true, isn\u2019t the time almost over? Is there really any need for us to do this?\u201d\u201cThis was the 2nd one. Who\u2019s to say there won\u2019t be a 3rd or even a 4th? Do you think the next one will somehow be safer? What if this safe zone suddenly disappears? Things could become so dangerous, we won\u2019t even be able to secure the rations that are over there!\u201d\u201cStop talking already. We need to form the next resupply squad, now. Who are we sending? We\u2019re almost out of time!\u201dPeople were fighting, split into two main factions\u2014people who had accepted this world versus the people who hadn\u2019t yet.It was the weak against the relatively strong.The people who accepted reality wanted to secure more rations for the safe zone. But they had to avoid the Earthworms above ground to loot the restaurants and convenience stores in the area.\u201cDon\u2019t feel so down. We were all originally going to die, and now a lot of us can survive.\u201d\u201cTha\u2014that\u2019s not fair! Why can\u2019t we all survive together?\u201d\u201cYou want us all to starve together or something?!\u201dInside the zone, people continued to argue. Even among the factions, a few people had already grown close enough to form teams.\u2018I\u2019m not surprised this is happening.\u2019The safe zone was crowded with people. There was only one reason why this situation was occurring.Too many people had survived.It was the result caused by all the people that should have been culled in the 1st and 2nd Tutorial surviving. People this complacent would not change, no matter how hard YuWon worked.Those destined to die would meet their end. Only the ones destined to live would survive. This was the rule of the Tutorial, and this rule would remain the same within the Tower.\u201cL-Look! Over there!\u201d\u201cA person?\u201d\u201cIs that a person over there?\u201dPeople started noticing YuWon in the distance.He was carrying a backpack, walking towards the safe zone. People were surprised that there was a person outside the safe zone, but they were also worried for him.YuWon became the center of attention.Was it because he hunted so many Earthworms? No Earthworms appeared to attack him.When he was almost to the safe zone\u2026Squirm\u2014\u2018That\u2019s more like it.\u2019There was still one remaining Earthworm.The ground below YuWon shifted.A few people with keen eyes spotted it and shouted at YuWon.\u201cBe-Below you!\u201d\u201cBe careful!\u201dThe Earthworm shot out from the ground to take a bite out of YuWon. However, YuWon had already hunted thousands of these bugs.Even if it was a surprise attack\u2026Stomp\u2014!Splat\u2014It wasn\u2019t a difficult task for YuWon to crush the Earthworm\u2019s head.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThanks to having 33 Strength, he didn\u2019t even have to use his knife to kill the Earthworm.Nobody could look away from YuWon.[Remaining time : 00 : 05 : 12]YuWon checked the remaining time before speaking.\u201cJust ignore me and continue whatever you guys were bickering about.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 9Chapter 9YuWon slowly stepped into the safe zone.People whispered amongst themselves at the unbelievable sight.\u201cWha\u2014what did he just do?\u201d\u201cYou could kill them?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dPeople\u2019s gazes switched focus from YuWon to the countless corpse chunks on the ground. If the Earthworms were killable, could the thousands of people who were massacred outside the safe zone have lived instead?\u201cHey, YuWon\u2014!\u201dSomeone approached YuWon.When YuWon turned his head towards the familiar voice, he saw Kim MyungHoon making his way out of the crowd towards him.\u201cWhere did you go? I was worried because you suddenly disappeared.\u201dYuWon thought MyungHoon must be pretty adept at acting. In front of all these people, he was able to act so friendly to an underclassman that he used to use as a punching bag until just yesterday.MyungHoon decided that showing off his \u201cfriendship\u201d with YuWon to the crowd would be beneficial to him.Instead of replying to MyungHoon, YuWon looked around his surroundings.The atmosphere was heavy. There was a mix of fear, wariness, and hope in the people\u2019s gazes.Paying no heed, YuWon walked towards the numbers engraved on the invisible wall at the center of the safe zone.[1427 / 1500]The maximum capacity was 1500 people. 1427 fell quite short of that number. Also\u2026\u201cThe food that they have\u2026\u201d YuWon asked, pointing to the food that people held in their hands, food that looked like it was looted from convenience stores and fast food restaurants. \u201cDid you guys leave the safe zone for it?\u201dThe closest convenience store was 20 meters* away from the safe zone. It appeared as though the food that they had was sourced from outside the safe zone.*PR/N: 20m = 65ft\u201cWe had no other choice. We didn\u2019t have a lot of food left, and the 3rd and 4th Tutorials will surely be harder than this,\u201d MyungHoon replied.\u201cSo what you\u2019re saying\u2026 is that you guys need rations.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou guys aren\u2019t wrong.\u201dThere were less than three minutes remaining for the 2nd Tutorial.The earlier commotion was probably people arguing about securing more rations before the 2nd Tutorial finalized.\u201cIs that the resupply squad?\u201d YuWon looked over at the group of timid and anxious looking people. \u201cThey\u2019re people that were pushed to the outer zone, aren\u2019t they?\u201dThey were people that were in the orange safe zone. People that almost died. Those were the people that had brought back rations for the group.\u201cSo, what, you guys were going to force them to go outside again? So they can bring back more food?\u201d\u201cWell, they\u2019re people that would have died anyway.\u201dMyungHoon was right. They\u2019re people that should have died.However, the people that exiled them to their deaths once already had no right to be deciding the fate of these people.\u201cSince they should have died, you want them to risk their lives to bring back food?\u201d YuWon said, staring MyungHoon dead in the eyes.MyungHoon started shaking after seeing YuWon\u2019s expression. YuWon wasn\u2019t doing anything other than staring at him, but MyungHoon couldn\u2019t help but cower. This wasn\u2019t the same YuWon that he once knew.MyungHoon avoided YuWon\u2019s gaze, but when he noticed his group standing nearby, it gave him back his courage.Looking at YuWon straight in the eyes, Kim MyungHoon started talking. \u201cIt seems that you still haven\u2019t adjusted yet.\u201d\u201cAdjusted?\u201d\u201cYou still think this is the same comfy, cushy world that you lived in? A world with laws and morals?\u201d MyungHoon gauged people\u2019s reactions after asking that question.He could see a handful of people nodding. It was partly because they agreed, but also because they were trying to justify their actions. It couldn\u2019t be helped since the world had changed. To survive, you had to sacrifice someone else.That thought process is how they ended up sending that 'small group\u201d of people outside of the safe zone.\u201cYuWon, in order to survive, you need to become a coward. Be cowardly, and be selfish. I\u2019m giving you advice, not as a sunbae,* but as another human being.*T/N: Korean equivalent of senpai.\u201cAdjust, you say\u2026\u201dYuWon couldn\u2019t help but let out a laugh. To think he would hear this from a brat like Kim MyungHoon of all people.[FINALIZING THE 2ND TUTORIAL.][Distributing 500 points to all the participants in the safe zone.][You have obtained an inventory pouch.][Your inventory pouch will disappear upon dying.]Plop\u2014A small messenger bag fell on top of everyone\u2019s heads. YuWon picked up the bag before speaking.\u201cThere are many ways to survive. I don\u2019t really want to interfere or give you any advice. But here\u2019s the thing.\u201d[THE 3RD TUTORIAL WILL NOW BEGIN.]\u201cDon\u2019t cross the line.\u00a0No matter what.\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t specify what that \u201cline\u201d was, but he didn\u2019t have a lot of time to just stand around and talk.As soon as he finished talking, YuWon looked away from MyungHoon. It was now time for everyone to focus on the contents of the next Tutorial.[HUNT THE MONSTERS IN THE SECTOR AND COLLECT 50 ESSENCE.][In 70 hours, the gate will activate.][After the time limit, the sector will be destroyed.][Time limit : 72 : 00 : 00]Vooom, woom\u2014In the middle of a street in the safe zone, a long, opaque tunnel appeared. There was a number on the tunnel.[0 / 50]It was the number of essence that the participants of the 3rd Tutorial had to collect.The opaque color meant that the gate hadn\u2019t activated yet.\u201cIs that\u2026 the tunnel?\u201dYou could move onto the next Tutorial sector after collecting 50 essence. That tunnel was the pathway that transferred you to the next Tutorial sector.It was a pretty simple mission.Everyone who heard the Tutorial\u2019s explanation had a similar thought.\u201cIt\u2019s just like a video game\u2026\u201dHunt monsters and collect items. It\u2019s a quest that anyone who has played any amount of video games would have gotten at least once. However, the real world wasn\u2019t a video game. It wasn\u2019t quite as simple a thing to do.\u201cO-Over there!\u201d\u201cZombies? A-Aren\u2019t those zombies?A few zombies could be seen in the middle of the street. People thought they had disappeared after the 1st Tutorial.But it wasn\u2019t just zombies. Various other monsters started appearing. There were giant spiders, as well as pigs with sharp, spiky fur. There were even centipedes the size of a human arm crawling up the sides of buildings.\u201cUh, uhhh\u2026\u201d\u201cThe world is\u2026\u201dThe entire world had already become a dungeon.That\u2019s when someone shouted, noticing the ground, \u201cThe safe zone is still here!\u201d\u201cI-It really is!\u201dYuWon clicked his tongue, disapproving of their cheer.\u201c\u2026 Tsk.\u201dThe people who cheered probably wouldn\u2019t survive much longer. The objective of the 3rd Tutorial wasn\u2019t surviving, but \u201chunting.\u201d50 essence. The only way to truly survive was to collect them, allowing you to move onto the next Tutorial. You couldn\u2019t progress any further with just self-preservation in the safe zone.YuWon got up from his spot and started moving again.\u201cYuWon!\u201dMyungHoon\u2019s voice stopped YuWon. He was about to step out of the safe zone when he turned his head to look back at MyungHoon. He wore an annoyed face that said, \u2018If you have something to say, be quick.\u2019\u201cWhat if we team up? Won\u2019t it be more convenient for you if you have companions?\u201d MyungHoon offered, holding out his hand.This was the second time MyungHoon held his hand out to YuWon during the Tutorial. The first time was at the start of the 2nd Tutorial, and now once again in the 3rd Tutorial.YuWon stared blankly at his hand before replying.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s even been a day yet. Did you already forget?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dMyungHoon was confused by his response, before becoming enraged.\u201cIf you want to survive, don\u2019t try to latch onto someone. Be a good boy and wait over there. Know your place.\u201dIt was what YuWon had told him right before the 2nd Tutorial started.MyungHoon was furious. His expression was enough of an answer to YuWon\u2019s question.\u201cSo you do remember.\u201dThose were YuWon\u2019s last words to MyungHoon before he turned his back and stepped out of the safe zone again.Watching YuWon vanish as soon as he had returned made MyungHoon grind his teeth.\u201cThat son of bitch, acting all high and mighty\u2026\u201dYuWon could already walk around freely outside the safe zone starting in the 2nd Tutorial. The outside was crawling with monsters, but he was perfectly safe by himself.MyungHoon thought to himself, \u2018So I need to defeat these guys and get essences or whatever?\u2019He looked around at the monsters outside. There were many different types this time.The 3rd Tutorial was unlike the previous two. You couldn\u2019t survive simply by running away. It was a mission where you had to gather 50 monster drops in order to survive.\u201c50, you say\u2026\u201dHe assumed the bags were given to all the participants to use as a means to hold the essence.MyungHoon kept looking back and forth between the bag and the monsters outside the safe zone. After making a realization, the corners of his lips perked up.\u201cYou all heard it, right?\u201d MyungHoon asked the people around him after wiping the smirk off his face.There were two types of people in the crowd. The first were people terrified of the fact that they had to fight monsters. The second were people who had built up the resolve to fight.\u201cI\u2019m sure you all know what we have to do in order to survive.\u201dMyungHoon raised his knife.\u201cLet\u2019s do this, together.\u201dYuWon watched MyungHoon rally up the people once again.\u2018He sure became cunning and inflammatory.\u2019A world that was suddenly turned upside down was enough to make any person go crazy. In the process, people often became cruel and selfish. So MyungHoon\u2019s change was honestly nothing unexpected.\u2018If anything, this is a completely normal thing to happen.\u2019That\u2019s why YuWon didn\u2019t have any intention to butt heads with people like MyungHoon.There were many ways to survive, which meant he couldn\u2019t interfere with every single person just because their methods were immoral.\u2018Besides\u2026\u2019YuWon walked down into the subway station.\u2018I\u2019ll never see him again after the 3rd Tutorial anyways.\u2019Zip\u2014YuWon turned the bag he was wearing upside down.Pour\u2014The marbles that spilled out of the bag went inside the new inventory pouch he had obtained. There must have been over a hundred of them.[Mana Essence][132 / 50]Was it because the 3rd Tutorial had started?He could see the display for the number of marbles in his inventory pouch.YuWon threw away his bag and hung his inventory pouch on his hip.\u2018I\u2019m lucky I obtained this much essence in the 2nd Tutorial.\u2019Mana essence was essential to passing the 3rd Tutorial. These items were obtainable from the Earthworms in the 2nd Tutorial. That\u2019s why until the 2nd Tutorial ended, YuWon focused on collecting mana essence by hunting Earthworms.YuWon\u2019s hunting speed was\u00a0remarkably fast. In just a day, he far exceeded the necessary number of essence to pass the Tutorial. He could make it through to the 4th Tutorial without doing anything else, but\u2026\u201cI wonder if I can collect a thousand of them.\u201dYuWon had no intention of being satisfied with just 132 essence.\u201cKrrrrr\u2014\u201d\u201cShhrrrk, shiiik\u2014\u201dAt the start of the 3rd Tutorial, the inside of the subway station changed into a different dungeon. There were not only Earthworms, but also zombies, Moss Spiders, and even Subterranean Snakes.All kinds of monsters gathered in the subway station to create the largest dungeon within the Hongdae sector.\u201cThere really are a lot of them.\u201dWas this perhaps a greeting for the first person to enter the dungeon? The monsters all rushed towards YuWon.Seeing the warm welcome, YuWon mumbled to himself, \u201c\u2026 Shall I try this again?\u201dShweek, shwaaa\u2014YuWon raised his hands. The mana in the environment started gathering over his palms.30 Arcane Power with 0.5% proficiency in [Master of Mana.] Compared to his first try, he only had 4 more Arcane Power and a sliver of additional skill proficiency but\u2026Shwik, shweek\u2014Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs if that was enough, the unstable orb of mana started slowly stabilizing.How long had he focused for?[You created a proper \u300cMana Blast\u300d][Registering Mana Blast as a skill.]Above YuWon\u2019s hands, a proper Mana Blast had formed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 10Chapter 10\u2018That should do it.\u2019The flow of mana stabilized. The orb made of mana was no longer shaking violently. Its registration as a skill meant that YuWon successfully created a full fledged Mana Blast.Woom, woooom\u2014The fist-sized Mana Blast howled violently, asking for its power to be unleashed. As he expected, he wasn\u2019t able to fully control it yet.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019YuWon aimed the palm of his hand towards the monsters that were getting closer.\u201cThis should be enough.\u201dWoooooom\u2014The mana blast shone brightly.Flash\u2014!A powerful beam of light shot out from YuWon\u2019s hand.Crumble\u2014The stairway leading to the deeper parts of the station collapsed.The heads of monsters that were running towards YuWon were blown to pieces, and their scorched bodies littered the floor.The blast didn\u2019t cover that large of an area, but its firepower was nothing to sneeze at.\u2018I can\u2019t fully control it yet.\u2019YuWon felt the mana leaking out of him like a deflating balloon. The mana consumption for this skill was just too high. It took all of his mana to create a single Mana Blast.\u2018I need more Arcane Power and higher proficiency before it\u2019ll be usable\u2026\u2019When climbing the tower, Mana Blast was one of the most basic of essential techniques. All it required was gathering mana into a single point and releasing it. It was simple but highly destructive.Due to its simple nature, it was a technique that allowed one to measure the user\u2019s Arcane Power and ability to control mana.\u201cThis technique really isn\u2019t my type.\u201dThere were plenty of people that specialized in using Mana Blast, but despite being able to create one, YuWon seldom used Mana Blast in battle.Plop, plop\u2014Roll, roll, roll\u2014Two essence fell and rolled onto the floor.Not every monster dropped an essence. They dropped from perhaps every one in ten monsters. It didn\u2019t have a very high drop rate.Taking that into account, YuWon had been pretty lucky up to this point, having already collected this much essence.Yuwon picked up the essence from the ground and put it into his inventory pouch. Then, observing that the monsters were cautious of him after seeing the power of the Mana Blast, he pulled out his knife.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dTmp, tmp\u2014YuWon started walking down a flight of stairs.\u201cWhy are you so afraid of me?\u201dThe 3rd Tutorial was all about hunting. 72 hours remained, and YuWon had no intention of wasting a single minute of it.Two days had passed since the start of the 3rd Tutorial.The 1st Tutorial might have killed the largest number of people, but proportionally, the 3rd Tutorial ended up being far more lethal than the last two.Out of approximately 1,400 people, only a little more than 400 people remained after two days\u2019 time. The rate of survival wasn\u2019t even 30%.\u201cAren\u2019t we too far in?\u201d\u201cYeah. I have a bad feeling about this place.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about it. Hopefully, we can find a hiding place here. But was Hongdae Station always this large? Am I imagining it?\u201d\u201cWho knows. The entire world changed. Why would this place be an exception?\u201dThree people entered Hongdae Station. It was one woman and two men.The woman was named JooYeon. She was guarding the group\u2019s rear when she opened her mouth.\u201cHey, hey! Over there.\u201d\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d\u201cA convenience store?\u201dThe group\u2019s faces lit up. They\u2019d been concerned about their depleting rations, so the convenience store was like discovering an oasis in a desert.\u201cThere\u2019s probably ramen, right?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no hot water. Why would you want ramen?\u201d\u201cI can just eat it raw.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go in already. I\u2019m starving.\u201dWhile thinking about filling up their inventory pouch with rations, something fell on the head of the guy running ahead of the group.Thud\u2014\u201cSsss\u2014\u201d\u201cAaaaagh!\u201d\u201cJoonHo!\u201dIt was a large green spider.The man assaulted by the spider let out a painful cry before dropping dead.His head melted off, creating a puddle of poison and liquified flesh. In reaction to the gory sight, JooYeon raised her knife and the other guy, SeongChan, prepared to swing his large hammer.\u201cGrrrrr\u2014\u201d\u201cChweeeek, chak\u2014!\u201dA horrifying cry.One by one, the monsters around the convenience store started revealing themselves: one zombie, two Moss Spiders, and three Man-Eating Rats.\u201cThere\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many?\u201dThey\u2019d already lost one of their companions.\u2018Can we kill them all?\u2019JooYeon\u2019s heart was pounding. During the last two days, the three of them had been through thick and thin. They had flirted with death multiple times, hunting the monsters outside. They even leveled up quite a bit. All three of them were above Level 10, meaning they possessed far greater stats than before.However, it was uncertain if the two of them could face off against all these monsters.There wasn\u2019t a lot of time to think. The three Man-Eating Rats jumped towards them.\u201cScreek, hiss\u2014!\u201d\u201cSqueak\u2014!\u201dMan-Eating Rats were the size of German shepherds, and they were the most nimble among the monsters that inhabited the subway station.JooYeon swung her knife at the Man-Eating Rat charging towards her. It was a knife she had bought from the Lackey for 200 points.\u201cEek!\u201dSlash, slash\u2014The knife was unable to cut the rat. Unlike sluggish zombies, the Man-Eating Rats were easily dodging her attacks.It was the same story with the Moss Spiders that melted their companion\u2019s head with poison. They crawled at her at a breakneck pace, getting up in her face.\u201cGe-Get away!\u201d\u201cSeongChan!\u201dJooYeon tried to push the Man-Eating Rats away from her.Gnaw\u2014!Slice\u2014Though she got bit by one of them, she successfully managed to get one of the Man-Eating Rats. Meanwhile, SeongChan, who was busy facing off against two Moss Spiders, let out a scream after getting bit by a zombie from behind.\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cNo\u2014!\u201dMaybe it would have gone differently with three people, but it was impossible to defeat six monsters with only two.\u2018To die like this here\u2026\u2019She did everything she could to survive \u2018til the 3rd Tutorial. She just wanted to struggle a bit more and live\u2026In the short moment she was distracted by SeongChan\u2026\u201cSqueee\u2014!\u201dJooYeon gasped. One of the Man-Eating Rats jumped, aiming for her face.In that moment\u2026Woosh\u2014!Burst\u2014!Something flew through the air, popping the Man-Eating Rat\u2019s body like a balloon.\u201c\u2026 Huh?\u201dJooYeon was confused by the sudden turn of events.She was covered in the blood and flesh of the rat that exploded in front of her, but she had no time to find that unpleasant. She quickly turned her head towards the convenience store.Creeaak\u2014The broken door opened.\u201cDon\u2019t be loud when someone\u2019s sleeping\u2026\u201dFrom inside the store, a person stepped out.\u201cNow, I\u2019m up.\u201d* * *Yuwon was taking a short nap. No matter high your stats were, not sleeping for days built up fatigue, slowing your body down.Taking the 1st and 2nd Tutorial into account, it was the first time in four days he had slept.He chose the storage room inside the subway station convenience store as his resting place. There was only one reason he was able to safely get some rest in a station full of monsters.It was thanks to the \u300cScentless Powder.\u300dYuwon had bought it from the new Lackey for 100 points. \u300cScentless Powder\u300d could completely erase the smell of whatever it was applied to, protecting it from monsters that had sharp olfactory senses.When YuWon woke up, the first thing he did was check the time.[22 : 58 : 12]There were about 23 hours remaining. A few hours had passed.\u2018So I slept for about six hours, huh.\u2019YuWon let out a big yawn as he got up.Six hours was just enough time to relieve his fatigue. But, unrelated to his fatigue, he felt the desire to sleep a little more.\u2018I guess I did over do it.\u2019Four days.Perhaps he was a bit too overzealous about hunting. He had pushed himself a bit too far because he thought he had to level up as much as he could in the early Tutorial stages, especially before the 3rd Tutorial ended.\u2018I want to sleep more.\u2019The thought would not leave his mind.That\u2019s when\u2026\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cJoonHo!\u201dLoud noises.YuWon slapped himself awake right away. The screams completely quashed his desire to get more sleep.It was whatever. Any more sleep than this would only make him sluggish.YuWon stood up from his spot.As soon as he exited the storage, he noticed the two people fighting against monsters in front of the convenience store.He heard three voices earlier, but seeing how one person was laying on the ground, he assumed that the guy must have died already.\u201c\u2026 If I leave them alone, they\u2019ll probably die too.\u201dWhat were they thinking, coming all the way here with such a small group? It would have been better for them to hunt at the entrance of the subway station. There wouldn\u2019t be that many monsters there since Yuwon had already culled their numbers significantly.\u2018Why don\u2019t I check out the situation.\u2019YuWon looked around. Inside the convenience store, the closest objects to him were soda cans. He grabbed one in each hand.[Activating Monkey\u2019s Eyes]Using a skill with a higher proficiency was always a mystical experience. As soon as the eyes were activated, he could feel all his senses evolving. He could hear sounds more clearly and became hyper-aware of his surroundings. He could feel everything. Their footsteps, presences, and even breathing. He could easily follow the movements of the Man-Eating Rats that were darting around the place.YuWon raised his arm and flung the can with all his might.Wooosh\u2014!Shatter\u2014Pop\u2014!The can smashed through the glass window and hit a Man-Eating Rat. The resulting impact made the can and the rat\u2019s head explode.Splatter\u2014Thud\u2014YuWon threw the other can in his hand.Pop\u2014!The zombie that was biting the man also ended up with its head blown off.That took care of the immediate threats.YuWon grabbed another can from the stack near him and walked out of the convenience store.\u201cDon\u2019t be loud when someone\u2019s sleeping\u2026\u201dYuWon looked back and forth at JooYeon and SeongChan.\u201cNow, I\u2019m up.\u201dWoosh, tup\u2014YuWon tossed the can up and down in his hand.Suddenly\u2026POP\u2014!In an instant, the can flew from YuWon\u2019s hand, blowing apart another rat\u2019s head.Slash, slice\u2014Stomp\u2014!A Moss Spider and a Man-Eating Rat got sliced in half, and the other Moss Spider got crushed under Yuwon\u2019s boot.Gurgle, gurgle\u2014Poison leaked out from the crushed Moss Spider and bubbled on the floor.It all happened in a flash.JooYeon was speechless, unable to even voice her gratitude. She just stared blankly at the soda can that laid on the floor.\u2018He killed those monsters? With that?\u2019They were hard to kill even with a knife. And Man-Eating Rats were so nimble, it was difficult to even get a clean attack on them up close.Yet Yuwon defeated them just by throwing some cans around and cut down the rest at a speed she couldn\u2019t even perceive. She knew that levels and stats were a thing that existed now, but\u2026\u2018That\u2019s actually possible?\u2019JooYeon pushed her amazement aside, as she realized that she still hadn\u2019t properly thanked the man for saving their lives.\u201cTh-Thank you. You saved us.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026 Thank\u2014\u201dThe bite from the zombie must have been excruciatingly painful because SeongChan couldn\u2019t even properly finish his sentence.Yuwon rummaged around his inventory pouch, pulling out an ointment and tossing it over to SeongChan.\u201cFirst, put some of that on. It should be quite effective. What\u2019s your Constitution at?\u201d\u201cHuh? Right now\u2026 Should be 17\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you won\u2019t die, then. You might not be able to use the arm that was bitten anymore, though.\u201d\u201cUhm, say again?\u201d\u201cRub it on right now. It might not be too late.\u201dSeongChan was shocked at being told he might not be able to use one of his arms anymore. He quickly applied the ointment on the bite.Meanwhile, JooYeon sighed in relief and sat down on the floor before asking, \u201cHave you been hunting here this entire time? Isn\u2019t the station pretty dangerous?\u201dThe subway station was an off-limits area for most people. Monsters appeared there more frequently, and though it rarely appeared, the Subterranean Snake was so dangerous, even a decent-sized group of participants would have a hard time against it.\u201cI wasn\u2019t here the entire time.\u201dAfter hearing YuWon\u2019s response, JooYeon made a face that said, \u2018That\u2019s what I thought\u2019. The subway station was so infested with monsters, there was no way he had been there for long.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuWon continued talking. \u201cThis is just my rest area-slash-restaurant.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA rest area?YuWon stood back up.\u201cMy hunting ground is elsewhere.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 11Chapter 11JooYeon and SeongChan followed WuWon.The convenience store was right there, but right now, survival took priority over food. If they remained here and got attacked by more monsters, they likely wouldn\u2019t survive.\u201cUm\u2026 Where are you headed?\u201d\u201cMy hunting grounds.\u201dYuWon continued walking while he answered. He led them down a strange path. They had no memories of such a place inside Hongdae Station.\u2018The layout really did change,\u2019 JooYeon thought.Hongdae Station had become larger and deeper. She was certain the stairwell that she was walking down at that moment hadn\u2019t existed before.\u201cWe\u2019re going further in?\u201d\u201cThe real hunting grounds start on basement level 2.\u201dJooYeon was surprised. \u2018There\u2019s a second level?\u2019None of the people that went inside the station had returned, which is why YuWon was the only person that knew of the stairs that led deeper inside the station.\u2018There\u2026 really is another dungeon on the second level.\u2019It was another basement dungeon the width of a subway car.JooYeon gulped.While pulling out his weapons, YuWon asked them, \u201cYou guys knew it was dangerous, so why did you come here?\u201dJooYeon tightly gripped her weapon with both hands, answering his question with a quivering voice, \u201cYou might not know this because you\u2019ve been in here since the start of the 3rd Tutorial, but it\u2019s complete chaos out there.\u201dYuWon nodded his head. He already knew. \u2018That\u2019s because this isn\u2019t a video game.\u2019On the surface, it might seem like a simple hunting mission, but the 3rd Tutorial was far more complex than that. When hundreds of people are gathered for a simple objective like obtaining items by hunting, it creates a complex ecosystem.\u201cGroups formed, and people started distrusting each other. Right now, there are ongoing fights to rob each other for these tiny marbles,\u201d JooYeon explained.\u201cSo, you guys ran here because you were being attacked?\u201d\u201cYes. I guess they didn\u2019t want to risk their lives since they gave up on chasing us once we entered here.\u201d\u201cBut you guys almost died here instead.\u201d\u201cWe survived in the end. Thanks to you.\u201d\u201cGyaaa\u2014\u201dA sound echoed. It was a cry that JooYeon and SeongChan had never heard before. It made their bodies freeze up.However, Yuwon was used to the cry. Showing no response, he instead turned his back to the source of the noise, looking at the two people.\u201cWho\u2019s to say I won\u2019t kill you guys and steal your essence?\u201d\u201cUm, pardon?\u201dThe two of them started backing away from YuWon.It was a terrifying thing to hear. Right now, YuWon was a much scarier enemy than any monster.\u201cHa-Haven\u2019t you already collected enough essence?\u201d Seongchan asked.Yuwon nodded yes. He had already collected enough essence before the 3rd Tutorial even started.\u201cThen do you have any reason to kill us?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still collecting more essence.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026?\u201d\u201cBesides, even if I don\u2019t kill you myself, you guys will die.\u201dIt was the truth. If Yuwon didn\u2019t help them now, they were destined to die without him having to lift a single finger.\u201cWhat exactly do you want from us?\u201dJooYeon\u2019s question made Yuwon smile.She was a pretty quick thinker. She knew that YuWon wouldn\u2019t have talked with them for as long as he did if didn\u2019t want anything from them.\u201cI promise it\u2019s not a bad deal. If you guys do a good job, I\u2019ll even give you guys some essence.\u201dTheir faces lit up from his offer. They would have been content leaving the station in one piece, but now they were being offered essence. They had to gather 50 essence within one day, so this was an irresistible offer for the two of them.YuWon stared at SeongChan.\u201cYou didn\u2019t hurt your legs, right?\u201d\u201cHuh? Yes, they\u2019re fine.\u201d\u201cAlright, then\u2026\u201dYuWon nodded his head towards the dungeon.\u201cRun.\u201d\u201cShaaaa\u2014!\u201dA large snake approached.It was the Subterranean Snake. It had appeared a few times near the subway entrance. It was a monster that could swallow a monster in one bite, currently making it the hardest monster to hunt.And right now, SeongChan was running with all his might away from that Subterranean Snake.\u201cAhhhhhh\u2014!\u201dHis Dexterity stat was pretty high, relative to his other stats, but the Subterranean Snake was much faster than SeongChan. It closed the distance between them in an instant, making Seongchan scream.\u201cSa-Save me!\u201dThe snake was right behind SeongChan, its mouth opened wide.Stab\u2014A knife flew inside the snake\u2019s open mouth. It blinked a few times, then the Subterranean Snake collapsed on its side.Spurt\u2014!The Subterranean Snake\u2019s blood splattered everywhere.Plop, plop\u2014Roll, roll, roll\u2014An essence fell on the floor.SeongChan looked behind at the monsters that were chasing him.\u2018Already that many\u2026\u2019In an instant, a few monsters began spurting blood everywhere. Starting with the Subterranean Snake, monsters unknown to him started dropping dead one at a time.YuWon jumped into the air.A two-meter tall, muscular Red Lizard opened its jaws wide for Yuwon.A long knife glowed blue. The moment YuWon and the Red Lizard came into contact, a red line was drawn across the lizard\u2019s body.Slash\u2014!He sliced it apart from its head to its torso. With minimal force, YuWon had killed the Red Lizard.Plip, plop\u2014Essence continuously fell to the floor.SeongChan quickly picked up the essence that was rolling around.\u2018Five essense from 15 monsters\u2026 The drop rate is significantly higher.\u2019If he had hunted outside, he might have maybe gotten one essence after killing 15 monsters. Was it because it was a different hunting ground?Compared to zombies or Moss Spiders, the Subterranean Snakes, Red Lizards, and other monsters that YuWon was hunting right now had a much higher drop rate.\u2018This hunting speed is incredible\u2026\u2019If he\u2019s been hunting like this the entire time, how much essence does Yuwon actually have?In just the last two hours, they managed to obtain over 50 essence.Plop\u2014The final monster dropped another essence. YuWon picked it up and put it in his inventory pouch.The knife he had purchased from the new Lackey was now coated in layers of clotted blood. YuWon turned around and asked SeongChan, \u201cHow many was that?\u201d\u201cThat was six.\u201dIt was another successful horde hunt. Counting the one he just picked up, it was a total of seven. YuWon took five essence from SeongChan, letting him keep one.\u201cJooYeon is a bit late.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dSeongChan and JooYeon had one job\u2014to be bait for the horde.In the subterranean dungeon, there were a lot of strong monsters. Until now, Yuwon hunted those monsters by individually searching for them. They might have a higher drop rate, but he was capped by the limitation of being a lone wolf.\u201cBring back a horde of monsters. About ten is probably good\u201dAt first they thought, how could that be any good? But they soon realized.\u2018We can\u2019t bring back monsters fast enough for him.\u2019It was unbelievable.SeongChan collected his breath, peeking over at Yuwon.\u2018Just calling him strong would be an understatement. He\u2019s like a different species than me.\u2019No matter how much they struggled, forest critters would still be forest critters at the end of the day. If the two of them were mere forest critters, YuWon was a species far above them, like a dinosaur.Outside, there were a few people who had become strong by being the first ones to start hunting. However, they were simply strong relative to the pack. They couldn\u2019t hold a candle to Yuwon\u2019s might.\u2018What does he plan on doing with all that essence\u2026?\u2019Yuwon already had 50 essence when they met him. For some reason, that wasn\u2019t enough for him, so he continued to hunt.SeongChan suddenly became curious.\u201cWhat level are you?\u201d\u201cLevel?\u201d\u201cYes. With your rate of hunting, I\u2019d imagine that you\u2019d be leveling up pretty fast.\u201dYuwon shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s slowed down a lot.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to wait for the next Tutorial to really level up properly.\u201d YuWon shrugged as he answered.\u201cBy the way, levels are personal information. Don\u2019t ask others about it, and if you\u2019re asked, don\u2019t answer. It\u2019s the same for stats.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me about my Constitution earlier?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I should have just let your arm rot off.\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d SeongChan let out a nervous laughter before responding. \u201cI\u2019ll take it to heart.\u201dIn this new world, information like social security and phone numbers were meaningless. The most important information about someone would be their levels and stats. SeongChan realized how foolish of an act asking and sharing them was.YuWon observed SeongChan, who was getting ready to go gather another horde.\u2018With this, I\u2019ll be able to gather many more than I originally planned.\u2019It\u2019d been two hours since SeongChan and JooYeon started helping him hunt. His hunting speed significantly increased. It was thanks to him not having to go search for monsters individually.\u2018This is about 50% more efficient.\u2019He was pretty satisfied. The increase in efficiency meant he was gathering essence much faster.\u2018The spawn rate is unable to keep up with us\u2026\u2019YuWon was actually pretty disappointed that there wasn\u2019t a harder dungeon within the subway station.\u201cGyaaa\u2014!\u201d\u201cShyaaa, shyaa\u2014\u201d\u201cYuWon-ssi*! I\u2019m here!\u201dT/N: -Ssi is a commonly used honorific used amongst people of approximately equal level.In the midst of their break, JooYeon had returned with another horde of monsters.Yuwon got back up. There wasn\u2019t a lot of time left. It was time to keep grinding.* * *Smash\u2014!The hammer in his hand crushed the Subterranean Snake\u2019s head. As the Snake stopped squirming, SeongChan shouted in joy, \u201cI-I caught it!\u201dHe heard the level up message. He and JooYeon managed to catch a Subterranean Snake all by themselves.While helping Yuwon hunt hordes, the duo were not negligent, killing a monster here and there. They were leveling up, as per Yuwon\u2019s advice.\u201cDid your level go up?\u201d\u201cYep. You too?\u201d\u201cAs for essence\u2026\u201dPlop\u2014An essence fell out of the Subterranean Snake\u2019s mouth. This was their essence. It wasn\u2019t Yuwon who caught the snake, but them.\u201cAll done?\u201d YuWon asked.SeongChan nodded his head to YuWon, who had been watching over the duo.\u201cSo we can have this?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the last one, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYuWon picked up one of the essence on the ground and tossed it over to JooYeon.\u201cAnd this is your last, too.\u201dJooYeon nodded her head.50 essence.They finished gathering the 50 essence that was required to pass the 3rd Tutorial. They had only managed to collect 20 before meeting YuWon. They had managed to complete what seemed like an impossible task.YuWon checked the time.[02 : 57 : 15]\u2018I should hurry.\u2019There wasn\u2019t a lot of time left. Once there were only two hours remaining, the gate to the next Tutorial would activate. He had to get outside before then.\u201cIf you\u2019re all done, let\u2019s head on out.\u201dYuWon started walking up the stairs.\u201cSo we\u2019re finally going back up. Will outside still be in utter chaos?\u201d SeongChan asked nervously, walking behind YuWon.SeongChan started remembering the situation above ground before they entered the subway station. He and JooYeon were running away from a group that had attacked them. They had lost two friends in that attack, and inside the subway station, they lost another friend. Remembering those events made him afraid of facing them again.\u201cStill?\u201d JooYeon shook her head in response to SeongChan\u2019s question. \u201cI bet it\u2019s become worse.\u201dWhen they were attacked, there was still quite a bit of time remaining, but people already started attacking each other, worried about falling short on essence.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euNow that the 3rd Tutorial was about to come to an end, there was no reason for the chaos to calm down.\u201cThink it\u2019ll be okay?\u201d\u201cI wonder.\u201dJooYeon stared at YuWon who was leading the way.\u201cI\u2019m worried for the people outside.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 12Chapter 12[02 : 31 : 41]Choi JaeHyun checked the time. Looking over at the gate, he could see it slowly turning red.\u2018There really isn\u2019t a lot of time left now.\u2019Once the gate becomes a bright, crimson red, people will be able to move onto the next stage of the Tutorial. Of course, this only applied to people who met the requirements.\u2018I have 45.\u2019He still needed five more to reach 50 essence. He had two and a half hours. If he hustled and bustled, he might be able to obtain them. He even leveled up quite a bit, so hunting had gotten that much easier.However, there was no guarantee he\u2019d actually obtain five more. That\u2019s why he came up with a plan, but\u2026\u201cEveryone else had the same thought.\u201dA lot of people had gathered around the center of the safe zone. They either observed what the others were up to from a distance, or they tried to make some awkward conservation.\u201cI\u2019m not surprised. If they still ain\u2019t got it, this is their only option,\u201d said DooShik.\u201cHey, how many you got?\u201d JaeHyun asked DooShik, who had been following him around the entire 3rd Tutorial like a younger brother.After quickly counting his essence, DooShik replied, \u201cI got 42 total.\u201d\u201cEight short\u2026 So there\u2019s no other way, huh.\u201dThe drop rate for essence was abysmal. You were lucky to obtain even one after fighting an entire horde of monsters. Zombies, the weakest monsters, had a drop rate of less than one out of 20.\u2018This mission is absolutely brutal.\u2019The mission was hard to beat just by hunting. That\u2019s why all these people were gathered here. The second the gate opened, they planned on stealing other people\u2019s essence and dashing to the next Tutorial. So for now, they remained still.\u201cThey don\u2019t seem like they plan on acting any time soon.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll probably start once the gate opens.\u201dThere were 30 minutes remaining till the gate activated. Whoever attacked first would become the center of attention, making enemies out of everyone else.\u2018As soon as the gate activates, steal and dash,\u2019 JaeHyun thought to himself, while keeping a lookout for the group at the opposite end of the safe zone.They were the only people that were closely grouped up near the gate. The largest faction in the 3rd Tutorial.\u201cHyung-nim,*\u201d DooShik spoke.TN: Hyung-nim means older brother, and it\u2019s a respectful way Korean men call men older than them. It is also commonly used in gangs to address people who are higher up in hierarchy.\u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cThat guy. Doesn\u2019t he look like he\u2019s watching us?\u201dJaeHyun shook his head at DooShik\u2019s question. \u201cWell, it can\u2019t be helped. We\u2019re not exactly friends. We even fought them a while back.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cThey far outnumber us, so for now let\u2019s just watch. There\u2019s no point in fighting right now.\u201d\u201cDo you think they\u2019re also short on essence, hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cA few of them might have enough, but most of them probably don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThen why would they be here?\u201d\u201cMaybe to help their companions?\u201d\u201cDo you really think those bastards have that kind of camaraderie, hyung-nim?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s likely this is not the end. If there was a 3rd, there\u2019s probably a 4th, and maybe a 5th or 6th, even.\u201d\u201cShit\u2026\u201d DooShik didn\u2019t like thinking about that possibility.Tap, tap\u2014Someone from the large group started walking towards Choi JaeHyun, grabbing everyone\u2019s attention.\u2018Kim MyungHoon.\u2019He was the one leading the largest faction. He was not only large in size and a good fighter, but he was also extremely charismatic with his silver tongue.JaeHyun and DooShik, with two other guys as the core members, managed to form a group of over 20 people, but MyungHoon managed to create a much larger group.At first, he only had 30 people, but MyungHoon was clearly focused on gathering people during the Tutorial. His group had at least 50 people now, making him the most influential person in the Tutorial.\u201cLong time, no see. What\u2019s it been, two days?\u201d MyungHoon said with a bright tone.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re so friendly enough to be sharing such warm greetings,\u201d JaeHyun coldly replied back.The two groups had already gone up against each other. They were pretty evenly matched in numbers back then, so it only ended as a minor incident. But things had changed, and MyungHoon was well aware of that fact.\u201cGosh. You\u2019re still as prideful as ever, even when you know what\u2019ll happen.\u201dJaeHyun tried to keep his face stoic, watching MyungHoon smile smugly. Nothing good could come from facing off against them right now. It was clear who was the top dog and who was the underdog.Seeing that JaeHyun was remaining silent, MyungHoon continued. \u201cYou know the position you\u2019re in, right?\u201d\u201cWhat position would that be?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019ll become a bloodbath at 2 o\u2019clock? With everyone being short on essence and whatnot.\u201dJaeHyun bit his lip at MyungHoon\u2019s words. He had it all wrong. While some people were thoughtlessly hunting for essence, others probably gathered essence by stealing it from others. Meanwhile, MyungHoon had thought things through far ahead of time.\u2018So he was preparing for this moment.\u2019MyungHoon had spent the last 70 hours gathering people. And in the last two hours, he planned on taking advantage of the fact that you had to go through the gate to reach the next Tutorial\u2014a scheme to snatch up essence at the final moment.\u2018He really is a cunning bastard.\u2019JaeHyun scoped out MyungHoon\u2019s group. Approximately 50 people. In contrast, he only had about 20 people on his side. There were also a handful of small groups that weren\u2019t associated with any faction, but it was unrealistic to expect them to be able to join forces at the last minute.\u201c\u2026 How much do you guys need?\u201d\u201cWell, we have so many mouths to feed. So we need about 700 more.\u201d\u201c700?\u201dThat was far too large a number. If he had requested 100, JaeHyun would have given them up to avoid a confrontation, but this ruled out that option.\u2018We barely have 800 essence.\u2019It was a ridiculous request. If they surrendered 700 essence, they\u2019d be left with basically nothing. JaeHyun was conflicted, and MyungHoon piggybacked off of that.\u201cJust give us 400. Then we\u2019ll leave you guys alone.\u201d\u201c400?\u201d\u201cYeah, we\u2019ll figure out the rest ourselves.\u201dThey were threatening to take only half. However, even that was too generous a concession.\u2018It\u2019ll be a full-on confrontation if we reject his offer.\u2019 JaeHyun looked at DooShik and his companions.\u2018If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u2019That was when someone entered the safe zone.\u201cSorry. \u2018Scuse me.\u201d\u201cComing through.\u201dBreaking through the crowd, a male-female duo was heading towards the center of the safe zone. They were bold without any fear, cutting past MyungHoon and his gang.\u2018Who are these guys?\u2019They were familiar faces. They remembered seeing them at least once, but they hadn\u2019t left a lasting impression.No, that only applied to one of them.\u2018He\u2019s\u2026\u2019It was a man holding a large box. He had an unforgettable face. Black hair with a short undercut, sharp jawline, and clear black eyes. The only participant to have roamed outside the safe zone in the 2nd Tutorial\u2026It was YuWon.YuWon\u2019s appearance silenced the crowd.MyungHoon and JaeHyun temporarily halted their dick-measuring contest because YuWon\u2019s presence was the ultimate wild card in this fight.There was no one in the Hongdae sector who didn\u2019t know YuWon. He freely entered and left the safe zone even before the 3rd Tutorial started, to hunt monsters. The scene of him stomping an Earthworm to death, a creature that everyone feared, was enough to put him in the spotlight.Thud\u2014YuWon walked over to the center of the safe zone and placed down a box.The first person to welcome YuWon\u2019s return was MyungHoon.\u201cHey man, I haven\u2019t seen you in a few days. Where have you been?\u201dYuWon looked over at MyungHoon approaching him. When he locked eyes with MyungHoon, he noticed the bloodthirst. MyungHoon wasn\u2019t even smiling anymore, radiating hostility at YuWon.\u201cWell, you know, I had things to do.\u201d\u201cSo, did you gather enough?\u201d\u201cIs the sky blue?\u201dMyungHoon nodded his head at YuWon\u2019s response. He honestly wasn\u2019t surprised. YuWon made his skills clear starting from the 1st Tutorial, so MyungHoon expected him to easily gather enough essence by hunting.\u201cHow many did you collect?\u201d\u201cAh, just a sec, please.\u201dSome of MyungHoon\u2019s companions came over. MyungHoon looked over and saw the worry in his companions\u2019 expressions.\u201cLet\u2019s not make him our enemy. Who knows what level he is?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right. Let\u2019s just leave him be.\u201d\u201cYeah. MyungHoon, I get how you\u2019re feeling, but\u2026\u201dOn top of his companions, even SeungChan,* his friend that was there from the beginning, tried to stop him. This infuriated MyungHoon.TN: Not to be confused with SeongChan, the guy YuWon helped.\u201cAre you all really scared of one guy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that we\u2019re scared. I\u2019m just saying we can just take essence from other people. Not only will it be easier to gang up on others, but we\u2019ll also be able to obtain more.\u201d\u201cExactly. At most, he probably only has 50, so why should we poke the beehive?\u201dThey were right. The condition to pass the 3rd Tutorial was collecting 50 essence. It would be much easier facing off against a couple of randos with 30-40 essence rather than fighting YuWon for 50.\u2018Logically speaking, it would be best to avoid any unnecessary fights here\u2026\u2019Before MyungHoon could finish his train of thought, YuWon flipped over his inventory pouch.Pooour\u2014Plip, plop, plop\u2014\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cTh-This crazy bastard\u2026!\u201dCountless marbles started pouring into the large box. Seeing a box get filled to the brim with essence was enough to make all the participants lose their minds.\u2018There\u2019s gotta be at least a thousand\u2026!\u2019It was a metric fuckton.It wasn\u2019t just the people who were in the safe zone who were shocked. This also caught the attention of the people who were waiting for the gate to open from afar. And one by one, the people who were keeping their distance gathered around.MyungHoon asked, \u201c\u2026 Are you all still of the same opinion?\u201dThere was no answer. It couldn\u2019t be helped. No matter how strong YuWon might be, he was still only a single individual. Not only did he possess far more essence, it seemed like a safer option to only fight YuWon versus JaeHyun\u2019s entire group.The silence from his companions put a sly smile on MyungHoon\u2019s face.\u2018I can do this.\u2019Honestly, MyungHoon was hesitant to fight YuWon mano a mano. Maybe if it was a fist fight, but he was well aware how skilled YuWon was with a knife. But that was only in a one-on-one scenario.MyungHoon had a group that numbered 50, a number that even YuWon shouldn\u2019t be able to handle. So he got even closer to YuWon.\u201cWow. You really got a lot.\u201dMyungHoon was now close enough to see the crystals clearly. And as he took another step\u2026\u201cLook closely at the floor.\u201dYuWon pointed to the ground, and MyungHoon\u2019s eyes naturally followed.\u2018A line?\u2019A line had appeared on the floor out of nowhere.\u2018When did this get here?\u2019The line drew a circle around YuWon.After seeing MyungHoon stop in his tracks, YuWon looked around at the other greedy-eyed participants.\u201cYou all need this, right?\u201dThey were all desperate. The countless essence in the box was enough to attract the attention of all the participants, magnifying their desperation.YuWon knew their feelings very well. No one wanted to die here.\u201cI don\u2019t need it. I already have more than enough.\u201dYuWon\u2019s words made someone come forward, shouting, \u201cThen, I\u2019ll gladly\u2014!\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuWon cut him off. \u201cBut it\u2019s not free.\u201dHe raised his index finger.\u201c100 points each.\u201dYuWon then pointed at the line on the floor.\u201cIf you want to buy any, first ask for my permission before you enter the circle.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was quite the hefty price tag, but considering how essence wasn\u2019t even sold in the Shop, YuWon was their only option.\u201c\u2026 But what if we don\u2019t have any money?\u201d MyungHoon asked.YuWon smirked at his question.\u201cI don\u2019t care how you pay for it, but you have to pay up-front. You can borrow money from someone, or you can even sell your items to the Lackey.\u201d\u201cSell items?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s possible?\u201dPeople who were despairing from being short on points started whispering to each other. They had all received a set amount of points from the 1st and 2nd Tutorial, but it wasn\u2019t feasible to hunt the monsters in the 3rd Tutorial without spending points. Most of them were low on points, and they were just now told a way they could immediately obtain points.\u201cI don\u2019t care if you sell your items or your stats. As long as you can pay me in points, I\u2019ll sell you essence.\u201dNo one dared jump the gun on his suggestion. You could get points now by selling your items and stats, but what about after that? You would have essence but also be that much weaker. And taking the next Tutorial into consideration, losing points was equal to losing your strength.\u2018If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u2019 It would be better to steal it by force.As everyone came to the same conclusion, their eyes lit up with greed. And standing in front of them, MyungHoon spoke.\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh.\u201dYuWon stared at MyungHoon, who was looking at his box full of essence.\u201cI bet you gathered that by killing and stealing it from others, yet you want us to pay for it? You think we\u2019re suckers who\u2019ll let you do that?\u201d\u201cBut what if I didn\u2019t steal them?\u201d\u201cBullshit. No way that\u2019s possible. I already warned you once, but it\u2019s survival of the fittest now. Did you really think we would trade money for your goods?\u201dYuWon nodded his head at MyungHoon\u2019s words. He was right. There were no laws governing the Tutorial. Once you made it inside the Tower, there were established rules, but the Tutorial was a lawless zone.With a sinister smile, MyungHoon pointed at the people that surrounded YuWon.\u201cLook at all the people that\u2019ll live if you could just be selfless. Don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too greedy? Huh? Am I wrong?\u201dThe people in the crowd nodded their heads. YuWon appeared to have at least 1,000 essence. With that much essence, he would be able to save at least half the people here. Then they wouldn\u2019t have to resort to killing and stealing. Just one person, YuWon, had to make a sacrifice.\u201cThat\u2019s fucking funny.\u201dMyungHoon looked at the person sneering at him. It was the girl that came with YuWon, JooYeon.\u201cKilling and stealing? Do you really think you have any right to call others out on that?\u201d\u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d\u201cYou really don\u2019t remember? You asked me to join you, and when I said no, you immediately tried to kill me.\u201dFollowing JooYeon\u2019s accusation, SeongChan came forward. \u201cIf YuWon-ssi was someone who would do such a thing, he would have taken our essence as well. This is like the one who farted accusing someone else of stinking up the room. I\u2019m at a loss for words.\u201d\u201cOh shit, it\u2019s you guys,\u201d Myung Hoon laughed.He remembered now. He didn\u2019t remember their names, but he remembered trying to recruit them because they were a party of five. They looked like a group of friends. Perhaps they had been cautious of large groups, so they said no to his proposal, which is why he tried to kill them. He managed to kill two of them, but three escaped in the end.\u201cSo what? What can you three do?\u201d MyungHoon said intimidatingly as he raised his hand.The surrounding people started moving all at once.Rumble\u2014As 50 people circled closely around YuWon, MyungHoon spoke with a smug look on his face, \u201cNo matter how good he is with a knife, what can he do by himself? You guys ran for your lives, and the best you were able to do was become his sidekicks?\u201dJooYeon replied, \u201cYou guys don\u2019t know anything about him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s funny.\u201d MyungHoon lowered his hand and commanded, \u201cKill them all.\u201dCling, clang\u2014!Dozens of people started pulling out their swords and spears and charged towards YuWon.At that moment YuWon said, \u201cYou guys\u2026\u201dSlash\u2014YuWon got up from his spot.\u201c\u2026 Crossed the line.\u201dSplash\u2014!A fountain of blood erupted.MyungHoon was confused as to what just happened.\u2018What in the world\u2026\u2019He was in shock at the sight of blood spurting everywhere. It was definitely not YuWon\u2019s bood. It was the blood of the people who charged at YuWon. They had all been decapitated.In that moment, Kim MyungHoon remembered something YuWon said.\u201cDon\u2019t cross the \u2018line.\u2019\u201dIt was what YuWon told him at the start of the 3rd Tutorial. Back then, he laughed it off as some naive nonsense, but now he realized that wasn\u2019t it.\u2018Was the line he was talking about\u2026\u2019He suddenly got chills up his back. Did he plan this moment all the way back then? While MyungHoon was lost in thought, his lackeys stopped their charge.\u201cTh-This bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cHow did he do that?\u201dThese were people who had been wielding swords against monsters, yet they couldn\u2019t even see YuWon\u2019s movements. The only thing they saw were the cleanly sliced necks of the people that crossed the line. It was more than enough to instill fear into them.\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d YuWon said, looking at the dead people that laid on the floor.There were less than 20 minutes until the gate activated. By now, almost everyone had gathered around the gate.YuWon continued, \u201cIt\u2019s survival of the fittest. There are no laws or rules. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so much harder to protect something than to obtain something.\u201dYuWon picked up a few essence from the box. \u201cThe conditions are still the same,\u201d he announced. \u201c100 points each. As long as you can pay for it, I\u2019ll sell you essence. Those who want to live, get my permission before you come inside the circle.\u201dYuWon was confident he could protect his essence.Krrk, kkk\u2014MyungHoon ground his teeth. How could so many people be intimidated by just a single person? He didn\u2019t want to accept it, but he was especially furious because he was also intimidated by YuWon.\u201cAnd if we don\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. I\u2019m not going to force you to buy any. But if you cross the line when you don\u2019t intend to actually buy any\u2026 \u201d YuWon pointed to the corpses that littered the floor. \u201cIt will be your grave.\u201dMyungHoon shouted at the top of his lungs, \u201cGoddammit! What the fuck are you guys doing?! Go! Kill him already! Fucking son of a bitch\u2014!\u201dHe must have had good control over his group. The first person to follow his command was Lee JiHoon. Others quickly followed JiHoon, charging at YuWon once again.YuWon shrugged his shoulders. \u201cI guess this was inevitable.\u201dHe knew something like this would happen. Everyone had gathered here to steal essence from each other, so of course there would be more people who would want to try to take it by force rather than pay for it fair and square.The 3rd Tutorial was better than any of the other Tutorial stages for amassing a large amount of points. However, the important part wasn\u2019t collecting a lot of essence, but protecting it. And in order to do that\u2026[Activating Basic Arcane Sword.]He needed to clearly demonstrate it\u2014the strength of a single individual suppressing a group.* * *Slash\u2014A decapitated head flew through the sky before falling to the ground.Thud\u2014His inventory pouch perished the instant his head was cut off, and with the pouch, his dozens of essence perished as well.MyungHoon\u2019s lackeys started hesitating. It was obvious to them that they couldn\u2019t beat YuWon.Thud\u2014Roll, roll\u2014Heads dropped and rolled around the floor. YuWon\u2019s knife dripped blood everywhere, completely covering the circle and its surroundings with blood.YuWon had already killed 20 men, filling MyungHoon with terror.\u2018How\u2026 is this possible\u2026?\u2019He couldn\u2019t believe it. YuWon was slicing the heads off people while simultaneously avoiding all the attacks aimed at him. He couldn\u2019t even see YuWon swinging his knife.An individual that can beat dozens of people. He thought they only existed in shit like movies and comic books, but that was what was unfolding right in front of his eyes.\u2018I forgot\u2026\u2019He was currently Level 11.\u2018What kind of world this was.\u2019In the world that MyungHoon was accustomed to, being able to fight with his fists equated to power. Once he became an adult, he learned the power of having a \u2018group.\u2019Actually, he knew the power groups had before that. He knew since he was a child that no matter how strong an individual was, they couldn\u2019t beat power in numbers.However, this world was different. A world where stats, levels, items, and skills existed. It was a video game-like world. Someone who was high leveled with high stats and OP items couldn\u2019t be beaten by dozens or even hundreds of low-level scrubs.\u201cGod fucking dammit\u2026\u201dStep, step\u2014MyungHoon subconsciously inched away from YuWon, and people stopped charging at YuWon altogether.There was no way to beat him. Even though it was just one single person, they were completely outclassed. It was like no matter how many hounds you brought, they could never take down a T-rex.MyungHoon was ready to run when a thought popped up inside his head, \u2018The line\u2026\u2019He noticed the line that was drawn around YuWon. Though it had become faint from being covered in blood, one thing was for sure. Since the start of the fight, YuWon hadn\u2019t taken a single step outside the circle.\u2018He\u2019s only killed people who entered the circle.\u2019The pile of corpses was proof. YuWon didn\u2019t hesitate to cut down anyone that even slightly crossed the line, but he had left anyone that stayed outside it alone.MyungHoon felt relieved.\u2018I\u2019m safe.\u2019At least he hadn\u2019t crossed that line. YuWon would kill him if he did. That would mean YuWon wouldn\u2019t kill people that didn\u2019t go inside the circle\u2026Pshht\u2014!\u201c\u2026?\u201dMyungHoon looked up.Drip\u2014Blood ran down his forehead. Feeling his forehead, he noticed there was a huge hole in the center.It almost felt like time was frozen. In the slow flow of time, MyungHoon looked at YuWon.YuWon hadn\u2019t stepped outside of the circle.\u2018What happened\u2026?\u2019He could no longer think. His body wobbled, and YuWon was suddenly inverted. The sky and the ground switched places in his vision, and the world turned white. He no longer had any strength to hold up his body.Thud\u2014MyungHoon fell to the floor. Before he lost consciousness, he managed to raise his head a little, and within his blurry vision, he saw him clearly.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat, you thought you were safe if you stood there?\u201dStep, step\u2014The footsteps got closer and closer.

    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 14Chapter 14Choi JaeHyun couldn\u2019t believe what unfolded in front of his eyes.\u201cHow\u2026 is this even possible?\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t make any big movements. He simply stood in his spot, cutting down people one at a time as they entered the circle. So when he finally left the circle\u2026\u201cUhh, ahhhh\u2026!\u201d\u201cP-Please save me\u2014!\u201d\u201cAhhhhck!\u201dThe people that were attacking YuWon started fleeing instead. But it was useless. With his high Dexterity stat, he caught up to them in the blink of an eye, chopping off their heads. Around the time he had decapitated another 10 people, someone dared to grab one of YuWon\u2019s essence.Slash\u2014\u201cAhhhh!\u201dYuWon immediately ran back, cutting off the guy\u2019s arm without any hesitation. It was total chaos. A massacre by a single man. Even the witnesses couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing.\u2018So numbers didn\u2019t matter.\u2019JaeHyun thought he was adjusting to this world pretty well. His base stats were high from the start, and after leveling quickly by hunting, he thought he should have been ahead of everyone else.That was a misculation. From the moment he thought an individual couldn\u2019t win against numbers, he had failed to grasp the essence of this world.Stab\u2014With his knife, YuWon pierced the heart of the man that crossed into his circle. And with that, YuWon\u2019s massacre of the enemies that tried to steal his essence ended.\u201c\u2026 What a mess.\u201dYuWon picked up his box and moved spots.Slosh, splash\u2014Not minding the pool of blood around him, he crossed over it and walked right up to the gate, as if he had planned on being there from the beginning.[02 : 04 : 18]Not a lot of time remained. After picking his spot, he drew another circle on the ground, setting up right in front of the gate.Woom, woooom\u2014The gate started howling. Seeing the once transparent gate inch closer to activation, people started getting really nervous.There was no longer anyone who dared to challenge YuWon.\u2018Since he\u2019s there, I can enter the gate right after I purchase the essence.\u2019\u2018I have 43, so I only need 700 points\u2026\u2019\u2018What do I do? I only have 200 points\u2026\u2019Everyone in the crowd scrambled around, anxiously observing each other.That\u2019s when JaeHyun stepped forward, \u201cI\u2019ll buy it.\u201dSurprised, DooShik tried to stop JaeHyun.\u201cHyung-nim!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAre you really going to buy them? Do you even have the points\u2026?\u201d\u201cI asked the Lackey earlier, and he told me he\u2019d give me 500 points for this,\u201d JaeHyun said while waving the weapon in his hand. It was the most expensive item he was able to buy in the Shop, having paid 1,000 points for it. Despite having only used it for a few days, its value had plummeted by half.\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cTry and think this through, DooShik.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think will happen if we try and kill someone here?\u201dDooShik had a confused look at JaeHyun\u2019s question. Frustrated, JaeHyun let out a deep sigh before whispering, \u201cNone of the essence he has was stolen. It was all obtained by hunting.\u201d\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cHow many monsters do you think he had to kill in order to get that strong?\u201dDooShik went mute at JaeHyun\u2019s question. He couldn\u2019t even fathom the sheer number of monsters that YuWon must have slaughtered the past three days to become that strong. It finally clicked in his brain how YuWon was able to collect so much essence. He had hunted that many monsters to raise his level so much.\u2018Besides, that guy\u2026\u2019JaeHyun stared at YuWon who was waiting in front of the gate to conduct business.\u2018Despite being able to, hasn\u2019t taken any of the essence from the guys he just killed.\u2019It was because of honor. It YuWon took and sold someone else\u2019s essence, that would ruin his plans. He wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctrading,\u201d but \u201cthieving\u201d instead. In order to convince the rest of the people to buy his essence, he couldn\u2019t take anyone else\u2019s. Additionally, with his display of force, he had proved to the crowd that all his essence was fairly obtained by hunting monsters.\u201cIf anyone tries to kill someone else first, they will become everyone\u2019s target.\u201dJaeHyun originally thought that the Tutorial was a lawless zone. However, he realized he was wrong. Even though the laws of the old world no longer existed, it was impossible for something like a truly lawless zone to exist. As long as more than three people were present, there was bound to be at least some unspoken laws and rules.\u2018In this world, the law is written by the strong,\u2019 JaeHyun thought, and currently YuWon was the one calling the shots.Step, step\u2014JaeHyun approached YuWon.YuWon didn\u2019t do a thing, as JaeHyun held his hand out, showing that he intended to purchase essence.\u201cPlease give me seven.\u201dYuWon nodded his head and shook hands with JaeHyung.[You obtained 700 points.]The fist trade was made. YuWon grabbed seven essence from the box and handed it to JaeHyun.Having collected 50 essence, JaeHyun crossed over into the gate.After that\u2026\u201cM-Me too!\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026!\u201d\u201cSeven for me!\u201d\u201cTen for me\u2026!\u201d\u201cDoes anyone have any spare points? I promise to pay you back in the next Tutorial\u2026\u201dThe street had turned into a marketplace.[You obtained 700 points.][You obtained 400 points.][You obtained 1100 points.][You obtained\u2026][\u2026]* * *YuWon counted in his head as he sold off his essence. People were busy calling up Lackeys to sell the items they had purchased.\u201cIf it\u2019s 100 points per stat\u2026 Wait a sec. Hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThree Perception points. That\u2019s enough for 300 points, right?\u201dWhile selling his essence, YuWon observed the trading between participants and the Lackeys that had appeared. In the Tutorial\u2019s Shop, there was a sell-back function. It was a way to get back the points you consumed by reselling the items you were using to the Shop. Then the Lackeys took the items they repurchased and sold them to participants of the next Tutorial. It was a cycle of sorts. However, this function was rarely used by any participant with even a hint of intelligence because most Lackeys were basically highway robbers.\u201c\u2014 This item is a bit damaged. I\u2019ll give you 300 points for it.\u201d\u201c\u2014 That item is actually quite unpopular\u2026 so I can only give you 200 points.\u201d\u201cWhat? That\u2019s completely bullshit!\u201d\u201cYou fucking con artist!\u201dThe participants voiced their anger at the prices that the Lackeys proposed. Items that were purchased for a 1,000 points were only being offered 300 or 400 points now, even going as low as 200 points.Lackeys were businessmen at their core. They did business off the backs of the participants who were using the Shop to survive. It was clear who had the upper hand. So participants who were desperate for points usually ended up selling their stats instead of their items, but\u2026\u2018100 points per stat.\u2019It was the definition of a scam.\u2018What an absolutely terrible deal.\u2019Stats inherently had a higher value than points. Though there were many items and skills you could purchase from the Shop, no matter how many points you had, you couldn\u2019t purchase stats with points. Yet here were Lackeys, buying stat points off of Tutorial participants at an extreme bargain.\u2018Yeah, sure, losing a few Perception or Constitution points might not seem like a big deal now, but\u2026\u2019In the long run, it was a huge loss. After climbing even a few floors of the Tower, they\u2019d realize how valuable the stat points they had lost were.\u2018It\u2019s probably better than dying here, I guess.\u2019YuWon checked how much essence he had left. People were fighting each other to buy essence once they realized they could sell stats for points. And just like that, over 50 people had now completed and exited the 3rd Tutorial.\u201cUh-Uhm, please give me 20.\u201dIt was a pretty big order. YuWon took a close look at his customer. It was a boy in his mid-teens. He did have a weapon, and seeing how few essence he possessed, he was also probably low-level.\u2018He\u2019s probably not going to make it much further.\u2019No items and poor stats. Someone like him should normally have died and been unable to clear the 3rd Tutorial. Since he sold whatever stats he had to obtain the necessary points, his lack of stats would start weighing him down more and more.\u201cHere you go.\u201dThe sales progressed smoothly to the very end.[Total Points : 167,400]YuWon nodded his head after checking how many points he had. It was much higher than he originally anticipated. It was a combination of the points from defeating the Mother Worm and the sales of essence.\u2018I thought I was only going to be able to get 100K at best by the end of the 3rd Tutorial\u2026\u2019However, the Tutorial had progressed much better than he anticipated. 160,000 points. Even inside the Tower, this was quite a sum. In fact, it shouldn\u2019t have been possible to earn that many points in the Tutorial.\u2018It might be possible now.\u2019YuWon got up from his spot.JooYeon, who was waiting beside him, asked, \u201cAre you finally going in?\u201dYuWon turned his head to look at her. Beside her, SeongChan was also waiting for YuWon.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you guys left yet?\u201d\u201cWe wanted to go with you.\u201dThough it was only for a day, JooYeon and SeongChan had been following YuWon.YuWon shook his head. It was a no-brainer.\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of making any companions here.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to consider us your companions. We\u2019re okay with being used as pawns again.\u201d\u201cAnd if you think we\u2019re no longer useful, you can toss us aside.\u201dCalling themselves pawns. That was no easy decision.A smile spread on YuWon\u2019s face. It was true that hunting went much better thanks to these two. However, that didn\u2019t mean that they could walk the same path as him.\u2018Not even close.\u2019There was almost no human that could walk beside YuWon. Without extraordinary talent, it was impossible to follow where YuWon was headed, let alone walk alongside him. Naturally, that applied to JooYeon and SeongChan. The two should have been more than capable of getting past the Tutorial and into the Tower, but that would have been the extent of their capabilities. YuWon was looking to get to the top of the Tower. No, perhaps even further.\u201cUnfortunately, this is it.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cI also told this to the guy that just died, but don\u2019t try and latch onto someone else. You won\u2019t last long that way.\u201dSeongChan had a disappointed face after hearing that from YuWon, but they had half expected it. Still, disappointment is unavoidable when your hopes are crushed.YuWon shrugged his shoulders at the expressions on their faces. \u201cBesides, even if I wanted to go, I can\u2019t. Because I\u2019m not going.\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean you\u2019re not going?\u201dJooYeon and SeongChan were confused.YuWon flipped over his inventory pouch. Not a single thing fell out from inside it.\u201cIt\u2019s because I don\u2019t have any more essence.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 15Chapter 15Thud\u2014YuWon tossed his inventory pouch onto the floor as if he no longer required it. JooYeon was shocked. She picked up his pouch and verified that there was really nothing inside.\u201cY-You\u2019re serious?\u201dJooYeon and SeongChan were dumbfounded. They had assumed that he had kept some for himself.\u201cWha-What are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cYou should have kept 50 for yourself!\u201dYuWon shrugged his shoulders.\u201cI told you. I\u2019m not going.\u201dAfter hearing YuWon repeat himself, the two finally understood what he meant. By not going, he meant that he had no intention to move onto the next Tutorial.\u201cWhat are you going to do\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you remain here\u2026\u201dThey were left speechless.YuWon\u2019s eyes went back and forth between his empty box and the people who were unable to purchase essence from him.\u201cCross over already. This place is going to be a madhouse soon.\u201dJooYeon and SeongChan hesitated for a moment longer before entering the gate.Done doing business, YuWon got up while stretching his arms. There was about an hour and a half left.\u2018I think the next Tutorial was defense?\u2019The Tutorial wasn\u2019t called the Tutorial for no reason. It was actually laid out in a simple structure compared to the various missions required to climb the Tower.The first was survival.The second was competition.The third was hunting.And the fourth was defense.\u2018Quite a few people crossed over\u2026 So the next Tutorial shouldn\u2019t be too hard.\u2019The 4th Tutorial was set up in a way where more participants were better. The participants would have less stats from buying essence, but with how many people crossed over, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.\u201cUhm\u2026 Are you all sold out of essence?\u201dEven though one could easily see that there was no more essence, a middle-aged man wearing small-framed glasses came up and asked YuWon.YuWon nodded his head and replied, \u201cStore\u2019s closed.\u201dThe man slumped to the ground after hearing his response. Other people had a similar reaction. After watching them for a moment, YuWon left. There was no longer a reason for him to remain there.\u2018It\u2019ll start soon.\u2019There were approximately 20 people left. YuWon knew they would start fighting each other to steal essence from one another. About half of them would survive while the other half died, and YuWon had no intentions on intervening and deciding who would live or die. That\u2019s why YuWon left.As soon as the major player in the center of the crowd vanished, people started moving, but YuWon had no time to pay attention to what they were up to. There was only about an hour left.\u201cShop.\u201dCrack\u2014YuWon\u2019s words created a rupture out of thin air. This was a normal phenomenon when a Lackey appeared during the Tutorial. However, this rupture was much larger than YuWon expected.Guuuuuh\u2014Kk-Crack\u2014\u2018No way\u2026\u2019It was exactly what YuWon thought it was. From inside the massive rupture, a familiar tall hobo came out. It was the Tutorial\u2019s Administrator.\u201c\u25b7 You called?\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t calling for you, sir.\u201dWhat YuWon needed was the Shop, and for that, he needed a Lackey\u2019s help. Unlike inside the Tower, it was impossible to use the Shop during the Tutorial without a Lackey.\u201cWhy did you come instead of a Lackey?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 I\u2019m currently hiring some newbies because we lost a lot of guys. Though we still need to lose a few more.\u201d\u201cWere you able to weed many of them out?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 About one in three had a connection. Many of them took quite a lot of bribes.\u201dAfter leaving the management of the Tutorial to the Lackeys, the Administrator hadn\u2019t intervened in the Tutorial for a long time. But after the latest incident, the Administrator was likely going to be busy for a while.\u201c\u25b7 And thanks to you, quite a few of my men got tied up in this sector. To the point that other sectors are facing delays.\u201d\u201cWhy is that my fault?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Because over a hundred people used the Shop simultaneously to trade with you.\u201dThe Administrator wasn\u2019t wrong. It was rare for two or more participants in a sector to use the Shop at the same time. Coupled with the fact that there were far more survivors in Hongdae compared to the other sectors, it wasn\u2019t odd that there weren\u2019t enough Lackeys to meet the demands of all the people wanting to use the Shop at the same time.\u201cIsn\u2019t that a good thing? Business was booming.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Well, that\u2019s certainly true.\u201d\u201cBut are you really that short on men? Coming here yourself just because someone wanted to use the Shop.\u201dNo matter how short on men he might be, an Administrator was the highest authority of the Tutorial. Operating the Shop should be the job of a lowly Lackey, so it was highly unusual that the Administrator appeared in person for such a task.\u201c\u25b7 It\u2019s not just because of the Shop.\u201d\u201cThen what is this about, sir?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Are you really unaware of the position you\u2019re in?\u201dIt took a second, but YuWon nodded his head, understanding what the Administrator meant.Special Administrative Target.YuWon assumed that to be the position he was in right now.\u00a0Special Administrative Targets\u00a0referred to participants that needed supervision for really standing out and displaying strange behaviors.\u2018But when an Administrator can\u2019t prove anything, they usually just let it slide.\u2019This Administrator clearly had no intentions on letting YuWon\u2019s existence slide. It would have been weirder if he didn\u2019t find YuWon suspicious, especially now.\u201c\u25b7\u00a0 It\u2019s the end of the 3rd Tutorial, and you currently hold over 160,000 points, not to mention your levels. You have enough power to destroy the entire ecosystem of the Tutorial.\u201dPoints were as good as power in this world. Even if you lacked levels, you could bridge the gap in power through high-grade items and skills. Normally participants only gained around 1,000 to 3,000 points at most by the end of the 3rd Tutorial. And in order to survive, they would have to buy items from the Shop as well as skills once they hit level 20.Under normal circumstances, one should constantly feel like they don\u2019t have enough points during the Tutorial because that was the only way to discern whether or not one had the qualifications to enter the Tower.However, the amount of points YuWon held far exceeded that of any other participant.\u201cThat\u2019s exactly it,\u201d YuWon said while nodding his head, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 What?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no problem, since that is the path I\u2019ve chosen.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 \u2026\u201dThe Administrator was at a loss for words, seeing YuWon\u2019s brazen attitude. Saying that he wanted to destroy the ecosystem of the Tutorial\u2026\u201c\u25b7 I have managed the Tutorial for a truly long time\u2026 But I have never encountered someone quite like you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201dYuWon checked the time. While conversing with the Administrator, ten minutes had already passed.\u201cI want to use the Shop.\u201dHe no longer had time to continue chatting. Even if he was the Administrator, he couldn\u2019t go against the rules of the Tower and deny a participant the usage of the Shop.\u201c\u25b7 Tell me what you need.\u201dThe Administrator held his hand out to YuWon, and opened his palm. From his palm that was the size of YuWon\u2019s head, the Shop\u2019s catalogue opened up.YuWon browsed through the catalogue.\u2018Is this the extent of items I can purchase in the Tutorial?\u2019After looking through the catalogue for 30 minutes, YuWon nodded his head. Because he was still in the Tutorial, the Shop didn\u2019t have all the skills and items YuWon knew about. So after having seen most of the things on sale, he had a pretty good idea what he should purchase.\u201cWell, to start with\u2026\u201dYuWon pointed his finger.\u201cI\u2019ll take this, please.\u201d[You have spent 10000 points.][You have obtained \u300cMid-Grade Personal Inventory\u300d][You are able to activate the item by saying \u2018Inventory.\u2019]A whopping 10K points. It was nothing compared to the money that YuWon currently possessed, but it wasn\u2019t an amount of points that should have been possible to obtain during the Tutorial.Though YuWon purchased an item, there were no changes except the consumption of points. The personal inventory wasn\u2019t a visible item. Instead, it was like a convenient dimensional pocket where you could store items.\u201cNext\u2026\u201dYuWon flipped through the catalogue and selected his next item.\u201cI\u2019ll buy the Arctic Steel Sword.\u201d[You have spent 50000 points.][You have obtained \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d]Woosh\u2014In YuWon\u2019s grasp, a pure white sword appeared. It cost a total of 50K points. It was the first proper item that YuWon purchased, but instead of trying out his new sword\u2026\u201cOpen Inventory.\u201dYuWon put his sword in his inventory in a hurry, and the Arctic Steel Sword vanished into thin air. The personal inventory was large enough for YuWon to store the few items he wanted and still have space remaining.\u201c\u25b7 The Arctic Steel Sword\u2026 You picked quite the challenging weapon.\u201dThe Administrator narrowed his eyes and stared at YuWon. He was clearly suspicious, but YuWon simply shrugged his shoulders and continued shopping.\u201cPyromancy Robe and a Magic Nullification Shield.\u201d[You have spent 60000 points.][You have obtained \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d][You have spent 20000 points.][You have obtained \u300cMagic Nullification Shield\u300d]A crimson silk dragon robe* and an azure-tinted round shield appeared above YuWon\u2019s head.TL/N: A robe with a dragon design on it. It was commonly worn by Chinese and Korean emperors.YuWon draped the robe over his shoulders and wielded the shield. He had now spent a total of 140,000 points.They were all pretty valuable items. Items that cost more than 10K points were even usable pretty far up the Tower, so these items were more than enough to disrupt the Tutorial\u2019s ecosystem.\u201cAlso, four Ice Crystals.\u201d[You have spent 20000 points.][You have obtained 4 \u300cIce Crystals\u300d]And in YuWon\u2019s hand, four crystal balls appeared. They were the width of a finger, and just like the \u300cArctic Steel Sword,\u300d they were pure white.YuWon put the Ice Crystals into his inventory. Now he only had 7,000 points remaining.\u201cLastly, please give me a Well-Sharpened Sword.\u201d[You have spent 2000 points.][You have obtained a \u300cWell-Sharpened Sword\u300d]Within YuWon\u2019s grasp, a cool-looking sword with a black hilt appeared. It was a pretty average sword and didn\u2019t have any special characteristics. Yet the reason why such a plain sword cost 2,000 points was because it was exceptionally sharp and durable.\u201c\u25b7 A sword that covers all the basics\u2026 That\u2019s quite the contrast compared to the overtly magical items.\u201d\u201cI quite like it.\u201dYuWon put on his crimson dragon robe and then tried out his new sword. It fit perfectly in his hand, and it seemed like it had decent mana conductivity. Although, basic mana conductivity was expected from items in the 2,000 points range.\u201c\u25b7 Not a single participant in the Tutorial should be able to pierce that robe. No one can touch you now,\u201d\u00a0the Administrator said with a questionable smile.\u201c\u25b7 Or at least the participants can\u2019t.\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t say anything.The Administrator stared at YuWon for a while before turning away and walking back into the rupture.\u201c\u25b7 I have high hopes for you.\u201dKk-Crack\u2014The rupture swallowed the Administrator.And that was the end of the trade with the Administrator.YuWon recollected the face the Administrator made and the words he said.\u2018Did he notice?\u2019It should have been expected. It would be strange if an entity like the Administrator still hadn\u2019t caught on to YuWon\u2019s plans.\u2018I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019YuWon sat down to rest for the remaining time. It was crucial that he was in the best condition possible.And so, some amount of time passed.Tick, tock\u2014A ticking noise could be heard. It was truly a cruel sound. Tutorial stages with a time limit always tormented participants with the sound of the clock ticking right before it ended.There were now 10 seconds remaining.YuWon looked up at the sky.\u2018So it\u2019s starting.\u2019It was the long-awaited moment.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[FINALIZING THE 3RD TUTORIAL.][YOU HAVE FAILED THE TUTORIAL.][THE ANNIHILATION OF THE SECTOR WILL NOW BEGIN.]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 16Chapter 16The gate to cross over into the 4th Tutorial disappeared. And it wasn\u2019t just that. The horde of monsters also disappeared, and the bizarre plants that wrapped around the buildings vanished as buildings returned back to their original layout.There were also some things that didn\u2019t change, such as the huge, invisible barrier that divided the sectors. But the biggest change was the sky.\u201cLong time no see.\u201dThe sky turned scarlet, and the temperature suddenly spiked. Luckily, YuWon didn\u2019t feel too hot.YuWon checked the effects of the item he was wearing.[Pyromancy Robe]\u15cc A robe enchanted with ancient magic. It\u2019s made from a special material.\u15cc Does not burn.\u15cc Strong resistance to fire attributes.\u15cc Increased magic resistance.It didn\u2019t have a lengthy description. It was pretty bare-bones for a 60K point item.\u2018A strong resistance, huh\u2026\u2019However, anyone that knew how to properly read an item\u2019s description would never deem this item \u2018bare-boned.\u2019\u2018It\u2019s not a bad item.\u2019Countless items existed within the Tower. It was impossible to fathom the wide variety, and among the myriad of items, only a few had their names well known. This was because while there were many different items, there weren\u2019t many that had their values properly appraised. And YuWon had already seen many of the best items that existed.The \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d of course couldn\u2019t hold a candle to the best items, but it had 'strong resistance\u201d against a specific attribute in its description. It should work as a pretty good defensive item against fire even in the Tower.\u2018It\u2019s definitely overkill to use it in the Tutorial.\u2019Protection from hot weather would be a piece of cake for the robe. Needless to say, it was only YuWon who was receiving protection from the hot weather.\u201cWhy is it so hot?!\u201d\u201cI-Is this the end of days?\u201d\u201cPlease save me! Please!\u201dYuWon could hear screaming and crying in the distance. He turned his head towards the noise.\u2018So there are only three survivors\u2026\u2019He could only hear and feel the presence of three people. The reason why those three were left behind is probably because all their essence combined totaled less than 50. They might have even surrendered their essence to someone else in order to avoid being murdered.YuWon started walking towards them. He couldn\u2019t feel the heat, but he could still tell that this place was getting progressively hotter.\u201cY-You\u2019re!\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t you crossed over\u2026?\u201dThe three people were confused to see YuWon. No one could have expected YuWon of all people to fail the Tutorial. How could they? He was skilled enough to amass over a thousand essence, far more than the required 50.YuWon glanced over their expressions. They looked as if they wanted something from YuWon. Did they want him to save them? But that was a pointless request. They were already drenched in sweat, their bodies unable to handle the heat.\u2018It looks like they\u2019re barely any different from normal people.\u2019Though it was a scorching 60\u00b0C*, this much heat should have been manageable if they had raised their Constitution even a little bit. Yet they were sweating bullets, looking like they were about to faint at any moment, signifying that their Constitution stat was not even 15.*PR/N: 140\u00b0FThere was a reason why they were the ones to be eliminated.\u201c\u2026 So it\u2019s begun.\u201dYuWon looked up at the sky. It had turned a bright ruby red. The air wasn\u2019t getting any hotter, but the Annihilation had already started.Gguuu, ggguuuuuh\u2014The earth shook, and the weather got as hot as it possibly could.\u201cIt\u2019s so hot!\u201d\u201cThe ground is\u2026!\u201dKkk-crack\u2014The ground split apart and flames rose from the cracks.Fwoosh\u2014\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d\u201cI-It burns!\u201dHeatwaves continued to spew out of the ground until one man finally caught fire. And not longer after, the lady next to him also caught on fire.\u201cP-Please save me!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m begging you! Please!\u201dThey reached out their hands towards YuWon.YuWon thought about the ice crystals in his inventory. Would these three be able to live if he used the ice crystals to help them?He didn\u2019t get to be lost in thought for too long.Flash\u2014Crackle, crackle\u2014The flames that were rising from the ground weren\u2019t all that big, but it was more than what normal people could handle, and the fire swallowed them up in an instant.YuWon shook his head and looked away. The world that had changed in a flash was laid out before his eyes.Everything was on fire with nowhere to escape. However, this world wouldn\u2019t call it an \u2018Annihilation\u2019 over some fire and brimstone.[\u2018ANNIHILATION \u2013 THE 176TH GIANT\u2019 WILL NOW BEGIN.]Kkk-crack, crack\u2014Whoosh\u2014A long, skinny hand shot out from the fissure in the ground. The hand was on fire, the flesh melting right off of it. The owner of the hand climbed out of the ground with great difficulty.Rattle, rattle\u2014It was a moving skeleton with almost no flesh. It wore clothes made of flames and held a torch in one hand. It was a trash-class Demon, a Skull.It wasn\u2019t alone.Rattle, rattle\u2014Coupled with flames, thin bones continued to pop out of the divided earth. Hundreds and thousands of Skulls made their appearance.\u201c\u2026 Yeesh. There sure are a lot,\u201d YuWon mumbled at the size of the horde.Trash-class Demons were creatures that barely even qualified as Demons. Technically, they were more like servants of Demons, which is why they were called trash-class.Demons were one of the ruling races of the Tower, along with Gods, Giants, and Dragons. Such beings appearing in the Tutorial was illogical. That\u2019s why it was called an \u2018Annihilation.\u2019[The [low-class Demon \u2013 Suruhtrah] has appeared.]Ggguuuuuuh\u2014The ground rumbled, and all the Skulls stopped in their tracks, looked in the direction of an unknown something, and bowed their heads to it.That could only signify one thing.\u2018It really appeared.\u2019One might be unimpressed because it was called \u2018low-class,\u2019 but a Demon was still a Demon. And if it really was the 176th Giant that YuWon remembered, it should be more than capable of easily slaying a Dragon Hatchling.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t this small during Ragnar\u00f6k.\u201dThud\u2014A gigantic hand surfaced from the magma-like subterranean fire.YuWon smiled as he greeted the creature that changed the landscape into hell with its appearance.\u201cSo we meet here, Suruhtra.\u201dSuruhtra was Surtr\u2019s 176th child. The first time YuWon met Suruhtra was during the \u201cAnnihilation Mythology,\u201d Ragnar\u00f6k.Surtr was one of the key members behind the annihilation of Asgard. Surtr had hundreds of children. Some of them were born as Giants but lived their lives as humans while some climbed the Tower and became Rankers. Suruhtra was one of the Surtr\u2019s children that was a Giant that turned into a low-class Demon.During Ragnar\u00f6k, Suruhtra was as big as a mountain, yet\u2026\u2018He\u2019s only about as big as a house right now.\u2019Fwooosh\u2014With a Skull face and a magma-red body, Suruhtra wielded a giant flaming sword. It looked up at the sky with great pride and arrogance. Suruhtra was the \u2018Annihilation\u2019 that had descended on this Tutorial sector.\u201c\u1437 And so another world is swallowed up by the Tower.\u201dSuruhtra appeared to be deep in contemplation. The fiery words it spoke were laced with all sorts of strong emotions like anger, resentment, and hatred.Being the 176th child, it was among the weaker children of Surtr, but in terms of appearance, it resembled Surtr the most.\u201c\u1437 A world doomed to burn and vanish should have never been born\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, Suruhtra.\u201dSuruhtra\u2019s head turned.Compared to the giant, YuWon looked as small as a mouse.Unhappy its brooding was interrupted, Suruhtra glared down at YuWon.\u201cAre you going through menopause? Why are you so emotional when you\u2019re only the 176th child? Now stop being so moody, and let\u2019s get started.\u201d\u201c\u1437 You\u2026\u201dSuruhtra lowered its head and looked at YuWon. Upon taking a close look, surprise dawned on its face.\u201c\u1437 You have the same eyes as him.\u201dYuWon immediately knew who Suruhtra meant by \u201chim\u201d because YuWon currently had the eyes of [The Monkey from Mount Huaguo].Suruhtra\u2019s put on a devilish smile. It was likely reminiscing an old memory.\u201c\u1437 I wonder. Will you also be able to escape from here?\u201dGuuuuuh\u2014The ground rose up, forming a giant, flaming chair. Suruhtra had used magic to create a throne so it could sit and look down at YuWon fighting.Once the Demon sat down on its high resting place, it raised its flaming sword up high.Fuuuuuuh\u2014Rattle, rattle, rattle, rattle\u2014All the surrounding Skulls started to approach YuWon. And once they were close enough to him\u2026Slash\u2014Crack\u2014!YuWon\u2019s new item, the \u300cWell-Sharpened Sword\u300d broke apart one Skull\u2019s cranium. And simultaneously\u2026Kaboom\u2014!The Skull\u2019s body exploded, and a black flame swallowed up YuWon.\u201c\u1437 Impressive.\u201dSuruhtra couldn\u2019t help but compliment YuWon taking down a Skull with a single slash.The smoke from the explosion subsided, and YuWon resurfaced from the black clouds, unharmed by the flames. A normal person would have been burnt to a crisp from that explosion, but YuWon\u2019s level and Constitution was already far beyond that of a \u2018normal person,\u2019 reaching that of a superhuman.Also, the strength of items definitely couldn\u2019t be overlooked.[\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d has negated the heat from a Skull.][\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d has gained additional resistance against fire attribute attacks.]The \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d was a useful item not only in the Tutorial, but it would be pretty effective even as far up as the middle floors of the Tower. That, of course, meant that trash-class Demons like Skulls couldn\u2019t harm YuWon with their flames.\u201c\u1437 That\u2019s no normal robe.\u201dSuruhtra recognized what YuWon was wearing. It was an item with a remarkably strong resistance to fire.\u201c\u1437 Did you prepare that so you could defeat me?\u201dYuWon shrugged his shoulders at Suruhtra\u2019s question.\u201cNothing beats paying to win.\u201dYuWon looked around at the Skulls surrounding him.He didn\u2019t avoid the first explosion on purpose to test out the fire resistance of the\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d. The explosion from the Skull hurt no more than a pinch, but nothing good could come from stacking unnecessary damage.The Skulls weren\u2019t all that agile, nor did they possess that high of a defense. And maybe it was because he wasn\u2019t imbuing his sword with [Arcane Sword], but instead of cutting, it was more like he was breaking their bones with his sword.Even being enveloped in fire attribute mana, except for the fact that they wore clothes made of fire, they weren\u2019t all that dangerous.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI won\u2019t be running away, Suruhtra.\u201dYuWon smirked. He looked around at the surrounding Skulls before looking up at Suruhtra sitting high on its throne.He would not run.\u00a0That\u00a0guy only barely managed to survive through this, and that wasn\u2019t enough.The tip of YuWon\u2019s sword slowly rose, pointing at Suruhtra.\u201cBecause I\u2019m going to defeat you.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 17Chapter 17Suruhtra stared at the tip of YuWon\u2019s sword.Maybe it was due to its fiery anger, but the Skulls that Suruhtra commanded stopped moving.\u201c\u1437 \u2018You\u2019ll defeat me,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dVooooom, woooom\u2014The crimson skies shook from its anger. The ground became even hotter, scorching flames rising violently from the crevices.Although it still had a ways to go until it was as powerful as it was during Ragnar\u00f6k, Suruhtra was still a Demon and a descendant of a Giant. It was the power that Suruhtra\u2014the one to lead the Annihilation of this world\u2014possessed.\u201c\u1437 Such arrogant and impudent words.\u201dDespite overflowing with anger, Suruhtra did not descend from its throne. Instead, it continued to look down at YuWon while resting its chin on its hand.\u201c\u1437 Say that after you have managed to reach me, foolish human.\u201dRattle, rattle\u2014Rattle\u2014The Skull Demons started to move again. Suruhtra managed to cool its anger and continue controlling its servants.YuWon scratched his head, knowing that this would be the case. There was no way Suruhtra would move from such light provocation.\u201cIt really doesn\u2019t like getting off its ass, does it?\u201dSuruhtra was one of the rare Demons that knew how to control its anger.It was the 176th child of Surtr. Surtr\u2019s children were weaker the higher their number, so Suruhtra wasn\u2019t all that strong. However, it still came to be known as a dangerous Demon because of one single reason. It had an extremely cautious personality. It only ever appeared in battles it knew it could win and never once picked a fight it might lose.\u201c\u1437 Let\u2019s see how much longer you can last.\u201dAnd today, it was being just as cautious as ever. Maybe it was because of the \u300cPyromancy Robe,\u300d but Suruhtra deemed YuWon to be tricky to handle.YuWon had no choice now but to get close to Suruhtra itself.\u201cYou\u2019re all talk, aren\u2019t you?\u201dYuWon started rotating his ankles while staring at the giant horde of Skulls.Rattle, rattle\u2014Jump\u2014YuWon jumped high into the center of the horde.Whoosh\u2014YuWon spun. Creating momentum at the end of his sword, he swung it around as if he was a Beyblade\u2122.Slash\u2014!In an instant, six Skulls were cut down.Boom, b-b-boom\u2014!A flurry of explosions followed, and a thick smoke once again enveloped YuWon.Fwoosh\u2014!From within the smoke, YuWon jumped out while holding a huge shield.The \u300cMagic Nullification Shield.\u300d It had excellent magic resistance and cost a whopping 20,000 points. It was one of the items YuWon purchased specifically to protect himself in this fight.Luckily, the Skulls\u2019 explosions weren\u2019t all that lethal. Or rather, they normally would have been, but the items that YuWon purchased were highly effective at protecting him.However, just like how you can get drenched if you stand out in a drizzle long enough, damage will eventually rack up over an extended fight, which is why YuWon needed more than just the \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d to protect himself.[You leveled up.][Dexterity increased by 1.][Constitution increased by 1.][Arcane Power increased by 1.]YuWon thought that was always a delightful message to hear. After fighting for two hours, he had already leveled up three times, and the distribution of stats weren\u2019t so bad either. Constitution, which was an essential stat at the moment, and Arcane Power, the hardest stat to raise, both increased.Since Skulls were a much higher tier monster than anything you could normally encounter during the Tutorial, it was unsurprising that they gave a lot of EXP.\u201cPheeew\u2014\u201dYuWon let out a deep sigh. Thanks to the increase in Constitution, it relieved a bit of the tension in his lungs, but he still felt a bit cooked from breathing in nothing but hot air for two hours.Though Skulls didn\u2019t have that strong of an attack, their post-death explosions were problematic, not because they dealt a lot of damage, but because they were unavoidable.\u2018Without a ranged attack, I have no choice but to take their explosions head on.\u2019YuWon was the kind of guy that liked to jump in and fight in the center of the battle. He did have [Mana Blast] in his arsenal, but that skill required too much mana. It wasn\u2019t a viable strategy for prolonged combat.\u2018As for my shield\u2026\u2019Crack\u2014A chip started to form in the \u300cMagic Nullification Shield.\u300d It was at a point where it required maintenance.\u2018It\u2019s starting to reach its limit.\u2019YuWon had killed almost a thousand Skulls in the past two hours. It wasn\u2019t surprising that the shield was reaching its breaking point after taking all those explosions.\u201cHey, Suruhtra!\u201dWhile looking at the greatly thinned horde of Skulls, YuWon talked to Suruhtra for the first time in two hours.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on down already? And let these small fry go home.\u201dYuWon\u2019s words made the red vein on Suruhtra\u2019s forehead convulse. YuWon had gotten pretty close to Suruhtra, to the point that he could reach Suruhtra whenever he felt like it.Suruhtra finally stopped resting its chin on its arm and got up.\u201c\u1437 They truly are\u2026 amazing items.\u201dFwoosh\u2014Suruhtra suddenly jumped up. And in a flash, Suruhtra\u2019s giant body landed directly in front of YuWon.Thump\u2014!The ground shook. After descending from its throne, Suruhtra swung its gigantic sword up onto its shoulder.\u201c\u1437 I\u2019m honestly quite curious how you were able to get ahold of such items in the Tutorial.\u201dFacing Suruhtra up close, YuWon felt a far greater pressure than he had been experiencing. Suruhtra broiled the already hot air, to the point that it penetrated the heat resistance of the\u300cPyromancy Robe.\u300d It was as expected of Surtr\u2019s child.\u201cWhat about you? Shouldn\u2019t you feel ashamed for going on a rampage in the Tutorial?\u201d\u201c\u1437 It is simply a punishment for those who are not worthy. I do find it odd, though.\u201dSuruhtra pointed its gigantic sword at YuWon.\u201c\u1437 You are worthy. You have what it takes to climb the expansive Tower and become a Ranker. So why are you here? Did you perhaps sacrifice yourself for a comrade?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you already?\u201d YuWon said while picking his ear, annoyed by how loud Suruhtra was. \u201cI\u2019m going to defeat you.\u201d\u201c\u1437 You\u2019ll defeat me?\u201dSuruhtra erupted into laughter.\u201c\u1437 Haha! Hahahaha! I see. Well then, it\u2019s only right that I face you.\u201dSuruhtra raised its giant sword to the sky. YuWon looked up at the sword. The sword enveloped in Demon fire looked hot enough to burn everything in the world to ashes.\u2018This will be it.\u2019YuWon clenched his teeth and held up his shield. He had already accumulated enough fiery aura inside his body and was ready for everything to be over.Fwooooosh\u2014!As Suruhtra\u2019s sword started descending, the \u300cMagic Nullification Shield\u300d started displaying more fractures.Kk-crack\u2014Shatter\u2014The shield broke, and Suruhtra\u2019s flaming sword landed directly on YuWon, crushing him into the ground. YuWon tensed his body to try and endure it, but the ground underneath him started to give. Unable to stand the pressure, the ground eventually caved in.Rumble, crash, crumble\u2014In the middle of Hongdae, a giant hole was created.* * *YuWon and Son OhGong were never really all that close. As a battle maniac, Son OhGong constantly nagged YuWon to fight him. Son OhGong\u2019s reason was quite simple\u2014because it was fun.YuWon found Son OhGong annoying because of that. He wouldn\u2019t stop pestering YuWon for a fight when YuWon didn\u2019t enjoy fighting all that much in the first place.Still, Son OhGong was a great opponent for YuWon. He had a true talent for fighting, and he taught YuWon his knowledge and techniques. He was frankly more of a master than a friend. And among his teachings\u2026\u201cThese eyes?\u201d\u201cYeah. I can\u2019t beat you because of \u2018em.\u201d\u201cYour Sensory Field is a cheat ability as well.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s still nothing compared to your eyes.\u201dYuWon repeatedly lost against Son OhGong. After hundreds of fights, YuWon had only managed to beat Son OhGong a couple of times. There were a few reasons for that: \u300cRuyi Jingu,\u300d the staff capable of extending infinitely; \u300cFlying Nimbus,\u300d the first cloud to ever come into existence, capable of raining down thunder and reaching the ends of space with its speed; and the infinite amount of Arcane Power he had gained by eating all the peaches of immortality in the Heavenly Peach Garden, a treasure of the Heavenly Realm.However, none of them were the main reason why Son OhGong was so hard to fight against. It was his eyes, the [Golden Cinder Eyes.]\u201cHow I got these?\u201dYuWon once asked Son OhGong. He had to know in case he ever needed to return to the past to escape from the war.\u201cIt was quite unusual. Do you remember the Tutorial?\u201d\u201cWhich one?\u201d\u201cNumber 3.\u201d\u201cI do.\u201d\u201cYeah, I failed that one.\u201dThat was a surprise. Son OhGong of all people failed the 3rd Tutorial? He had unparalleled talent for fighting. There\u2019s no way he would have failed the Tutorial because he couldn\u2019t gather a measly 50 essence.\u201cWell, there\u2019s a reason why I failed, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s important. What\u2019s important is what came after.\u201d\u201cAfter?\u201d\u201cDo you know what the \u2018Annihilation\u2019 that came to the Tutorial was?\u201dThere was no way YuWon knew. Actually, almost no one knew. No one else around had failed the 3rd Tutorial, especially since failing the Tutorial signified death. So it was a very interesting story.YuWon silently stared at Son OhGong, signaling him to go on.Enjoying YuWon\u2019s company, Son OhGong smirked as he continued talking, \u201cOkay, listen closely. These eyes were\u2026\u201d* * *The ground caved in from the flames of the sword.Suruhtra looked down into the hole created by the Flame Sword.Fwoosh, woosh\u2014The hole was smoldering with crimson fire. This fire would never die, unless Suruhtra ran out of power. Suruhtra thought that no matter how great the items he possessed were, YuWon should have either died or at least been gravely injured.\u201c\u1437 \u2026 How odd.\u201dIt appeared to Suruhtra that YuWon purposely took the attack instead of dodging it. But why did YuWon purposely take on the hellfire? Suruhtra pondered while looking down into the depth of the crater.At that moment\u2026Fwoosh\u2014From within the fiery pit\u2026Step, step\u2014YuWon slowly walked out, his body scorched black.\u201c\u2026 I thought I\u2019d die from how hot it was.\u201dWhile breathing out the fiery aura built up in his body, YuWon stared back at Suruhtra. And when their eyes locked, Suruhtra\u2019s eyes widened.\u201c\u1437 You\u2014your eyes\u2026\u201dFwoosh\u2014His irises had turned scarlet.The eyes capable of observing and seeing through all of creation. The second stage of the [Golden Cinder Eyes.] The power of the Great God, \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal.\u201d[You have fulfilled the conditions for the hidden piece.*]*TL/N: Hidden piece means a hidden part of the system. It\u2019s a Korean video game term for hidden elements such as items and skills that actually affect the game.

    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 18Chapter 18Fwoosh\u2014Everything looked new with his flaming eyes. His body\u2019s senses felt as fired up as a forge\u2019s roaring furnace, and he felt as if he was constantly in the heat of battle.\u2018So this is\u2026 Cinder Eyes.\u2019There were three stages to the [Golden Cinder Eyes.] The first is [Monkey\u2019s Eyes]\u2014eyes that Son OhGong, the monkey of Mount Huaguo, possessed. The second was [Cinder Eyes]\u2014eyes that swallowed Demon fire.The only way to awaken the [Cinder Eyes] was to swallow a Demon\u2019s fire with the hidden piece of the Tutorial and imbue them into your eyes.\u2018I never thought a day would come where I would respect that idiot.\u2019Suruhtra\u2019s fire was indeed hot. But it wasn\u2019t just hot. YuWon\u2019s entire body was engulfed in flame, burning his skin off. It was a level of pain that would have made anyone with weak focus and mental fortitude go insane. That was what he felt while wearing the \u300cPyromancy Robe.\u300d But what about Son OhGong?\u2018His body defies all logic.\u2019Without any special items, Son OhGong was able to hold his ground against Suruhtra until he obtained the [Cinder Eyes.] Son OhGong told YuWon that he was physically on another level from birth. Turned out he wasn\u2019t exaggerating.[Cinder Eyes]\u15cc Rank : A\u15cc Proficiency : 12.14%\u15cc Monkey\u2019s Eyes that synchronized with Demon fire. It is able to tell apart good and evil as well as truth and lies.\u15cc Strong resistance to fire.\u15cc Sensory amplification.\u15cc Battle prediction.An A-rank skill. It was nothing compared to [Master of Mana,] an Authority of an Administrator, but S-rank skills should have been unattainable in the Tutorial anyways. And A-rank skills were so rare that even Rankers only possessed a few of them.What was really great is that [Cinder Eyes] already had over 10% proficiency. The higher the rank of the skill, the harder it was to raise its proficiency. So, taking that into account, 12% honestly felt like cheating.\u2018I\u2019m glad I raised the proficiency early on.\u2019As a skill obtained by evolving [Monkey\u2019s Eyes] with a hidden piece, it was only natural for some properties to carry over.It was easy to raise the proficiency of [Monkey\u2019s Eyes], it being only an F-rank skill. And YuWon kept the skill active almost the entire time after obtaining it. Because it was a low-rank skill, it didn\u2019t consume much mana, so YuWon intended to raise the proficiency as high as he could.\u201c\u1437 \u2018You want to get started\u2019?\u201dSuruhtra smirked faintly. It was shocked after seeing YuWon walk out of the flaming pit, but the surprise didn\u2019t last too long. YuWon\u2019s body was covered in burns, not to mention he was unable to dissipate the fiery aura from within his body.\u201c\u1437 And what exactly do you want to start when your body\u2019s in such a state?\u201dIt was only natural for Suruhtra to look down on YuWon. It was not only the child of the Giant Surtr, it was also a Demon, one of the races that ruled the Tower. Though it was weaker due to the restrictions of the Tutorial, it still couldn\u2019t help but look at the gravely wounded YuWon as nothing more than a pest.\u201cThis is nothing.\u201dWhoom\u2014YuWon extended his arm, and the space in front of him started to ripple. It was his \u300cMid-Grade Personal Inventory.\u300d YuWon reached both his hands into his inventory, and from within, he pulled out a weapon and a medicine ball.\u201c\u1437 That\u2019s\u2026\u201dSuruhtra squinted its eye, closely observing the sword in YuWon\u2019s hand. A sword with a white blade and hilt. The oddly-colored, simple-looking sword radiated an icy aura that felt like one touch would give you frostbite.Kk-crack\u2014Shhhh\u2014The icy aura of the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d seeped into YuWon\u2019s body. It started to cool him down. It collided with the fiery aura that had accumulated within his body, and the two nullified each other.This, of course, wasn\u2019t all that YuWon had prepared.Gulp\u2014YuWon swallowed the two medicine balls.[You have consumed an \u300cIce Crystal.\u300d][You have consumed an \u300cIce Crystal.\u300d][Your body temperature steadily drops.][Neutralizing status effect : Burn.][Attribute : Ice has been added to your Arcane Power.]The extreme heat and awful burn that enveloped YuWon disappeared. But in their place, a deep chill took over his body.\u201cFuuu\u2014\u201dYuWon started breathing out frost. And even though he was still surrounded by a sea of fire, he could no longer feel the heat. It was thanks to the two \u300cIce Crystals\u300d he consumed and the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d in his hand.\u2018I actually feel a bit chilly now.\u2019The \u300cIce Crystals\u300d and the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d possessed an aura that was the polar opposite of fire, especially the \u300cArctic Steel Sword.\u300dIt was forged from a glacier and was sharper than most steel swords. The \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d possessed a powerful icy aura, but as a side effect, it slowly froze the user.\u2018That\u2019s why\u2026\u2019Suhurtra flinched from the aura emanating from the sword. It realized that the aura coming off of YuWon and the sword could actually hurt it.\u2018\u2026 This just might be doable.\u2019Suruhtra, the low-class Demon.Now that YuWon had obtained the [Cinder Eyes,] it was finally time to defeat Suruhtra.Thud\u2014YuWon stepped foot onto level ground as Suruhtra\u2019s sword swung down at him.Fwooosh\u2014!A giant flame engulfed YuWon. Instead of trying to dodge it, he swung his sword at the fire.[\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d is resisting Suruhtra\u2019s Flames of Annihilation.][\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d has gained additional resistance against Fire Attribute attacks.][Cinder Eyes are resisting Suruhtra\u2019s Flames of Annihilation.][Cinder Eyes are absorbing Suruhtra\u2019s Flames of Annihilation.]This was an attack that just moments ago broke the \u300cMagic Nullification Shield\u300d and almost killed YuWon. However, in a short span of time, things had changed greatly.[Your body temperature is rapidly decreasing.][Resisting status effect : Burn.][Cinder Eyes.] \u300cPyromancy Robe.\u300d As well as the \u300cIce Crystals\u300d and the \u300cArctic Steel Sword.\u300d The combined forces of the skills and items allowed YuWon to cut through Suruhtra\u2019s flames.Slash\u2014!YuWon managed to cut a path through the flames for himself. Leaping high into the air, YuWon entered Suruhtra\u2019s personal space near its waist\u2026Slash\u2014!\u2026 And slashed Suruhtra\u2019s torso, cutting through its armor of fire.\u201c\u1437 Ahhhhh!\u201dSuruhtra screamed in agony.It was working. Normally, such a feat would be inconceivable because one couldn\u2019t normally pierce through Suruhtra\u2019s armor of fire, even with high Strength and Arcane Power stats. Yet YuWon had managed to do exactly that thanks to the power of the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d and the \u300cIce Crystals.\u300d\u201c\u1437 You\u2026!\u201dThe \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d was indeed great at cutting. In return for slowly freezing the user with its icy aura, the sword was capable of slicing and freezing almost anything.Hot blood spouted from the wound to Suruhtra\u2019s torso.Fwooosh\u2014Suruhtra became enraged, its body slowly turning black. And from within its hand, a crimson and black infernal flame materialized. The onyx-colored flame was most definitely a threat.\u2018I need to dodge it.\u2019YuWon\u2019s vision was tinted red thanks to the power of [Cinder Eyes.] And within his vision, a path was drawn. He could instinctively feel it. That was where he had to move to. It was one of the powers of the [Cinder Eyes,] \u2018Battle Prediction.\u2019Wooosh\u2014Boom, b-boom\u2014!Suruhtra\u2019s black flames started incinerating the entire area. The black flames differed from the normal fire that was prevalent until a moment ago. Instead of simply scorching the ground, these flames were capable of completely melting earth away. It was one of the Authorities of a Demon, the ability to call forth Hellfire.\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dThankfully, YuWon was able to avoid being incinerated by the black flames, but he was unable to come out fully unscathed. He tried to dissipate the heat with the \u300cArctic Steel Sword,\u300d but it was no use. He wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight against Suruhtra yet.\u2018Two crystals weren\u2019t enough.\u2019YuWon pulled out the other two \u300cIce Crystals\u300d from his inventory and swallowed them.[Your body temperature greatly drops.][You are now affected by the status effect : Frostbite.]The icy aura of the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d had been gradually taking over YuWon\u2019s body. Despite the fact that he was being blasted with heat, his body was now full of icy aura.To get burned and frostbite at the same time. YuWon had faced all sorts of situations in the Tower, but this was the first time he had experienced anything like this.\u2018I won\u2019t last much longer.\u2019The Ice Attribute was a natural weakness for a\u00a0Giant\u00a0of fire like Suruhtra, but the problem was that YuWon wasn\u2019t physically capable of handling so much icy aura yet.\u2018I need to finish this quickly.\u2019With this much icy aura, he could somewhat fight against Suruhtra\u2019s flames.His heart and chest felt like they were now frozen solid. Feeling as if he was suffocating from the cold, YuWon let out a deep breath, barely managing to exhale some of the icy aura within him.While he was exhaling, Suruhtra\u2019s sword descended upon him.Craaaash\u2014!The black flames split apart the earth.YuWon twisted his body, dodging the attack. Moving away from the melting ground, YuWon ran towards Suruhtra.Slash\u2014YuWon jumped at Suruhtra\u2019s legs. He was running out of time. He no longer had the luxury of conserving his mana.[Arcane Sword]Woom, wooom\u2014The [Arcane Sword] extended a few inches beyond the \u300cArctic Steel Sword.\u300dYuWon swung his sword against Suruhtra\u2019s leg with all his might.Slice\u2014YuWon inflicted a clean cut on Suruhtra\u2019s leg.\u201c\u1437 Aaaagh!\u201dSuruhtra cried in agony. Losing its balance from the loss of one leg, Suruhtra fell to its knees with a thud.Searching for YuWon, Suruhtra quickly raised its head, but before it could find him\u2026Woom, wooom\u2014\u2026 A white ball of ice mana flew right into Suruhtra\u2019s face.[Mana Blast]Boom\u2014!Kk-kk-crack\u2014A [Mana Blast] reinforced with the power of the \u300cIce Crystals\u300d landed a direct hit to Suruhtra\u2019s face and Suruhtra\u2019s flaming head froze in an instant. This caused Suruhtra to lose its balance and sway.But it didn\u2019t last long.Fwoosh\u2014Fire rose from Suruhtra\u2019s head once again. Suruhtra might have a weakness against ice, but the difference in power between Suruhtra and YuWon was far too great.But for YuWon, disrupting Suruhtra\u2019s balance for just a moment was more than enough.\u2018I can see it.\u2019With the power of the [Cinder Eyes,] the world appeared like it had slowed down a tempo. Suruhtra\u2019s swaying body was definitely large, but it wasn\u2019t impossible to climb up, so YuWon got on top of Suruhtra\u2019s back.Feeling YuWon standing on its neck, Suruhtra shook its head.\u201c\u1437 You insolent bastard! How dare you! You\u2019re a brat that hasn\u2019t even climbed the Tower yet\u2026!\u201dFwooosh\u2014!Flames started raging across Suruhtra\u2019s body. They were the [Flames of Annihilation.] It was a fire that was mixed with black Hellfire\u2014the fire that would destroy this Tutorial.

    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 19Chapter 19After passing out on the ground, quite a bit of time passed before YuWon managed to wake up. He wondered how many hours had gone by. His body was still a mess. Seeing how he had just managed to gain consciousness with none of his burns having healed yet, YuWon assumed not too many hours had passed.YuWon\u2019s whole body ached from the burns. And that wasn\u2019t the last of it.\u2018The icy aura is still the same.\u2019The burns weren\u2019t his biggest problem. It was the icy aura that remained inside him after handling the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d and four \u300cIce Crystals.\u300dYuWon\u2019s lips were cracked dry, yet his insides felt frozen over. Simply put, his body was a wreck.\u2018I almost died.\u2019That was the first thought YuWon had after waking up. He really had approached the brink of death.\u2018It could have gone real bad if I had been even a little slower.\u2019After getting up, YuWon saw that he was surrounded by Skull remains and Suruhtra\u2019s corpse. YuWon\u2019s guess was that he must have tumbled off of Suruhtra\u2019s head after losing consciousness.\u201c\u2026 I actually defeated him.\u201dAnd with that, YuWon had obtained [Cinder Eyes,] the thing he really needed to obtain in the Tutorial. It was the halfway point to obtaining the [Golden Cinder Eyes.] However, the Tutorial had yet to end.\u2018How is this not the end?\u2019YuWon couldn\u2019t help but laugh to himself.\u201cThis really is a turbulent journey, you bastards,\u201d he mumbled while remembering his comrades that decided to send him back to the past.This was just the 3rd Tutorial. He still had a long ways to go.Step\u2014YuWon climbed up Suruhtra\u2019s corpse. With the fires extinguished, Suruhtra\u2019s body looked quite unimpressive. It looked like the corpse of a normal giant. However, this was no normal corpse.\u2018Every single by-product of a Demon\u2019s corpse is an item.\u2019Demons were beings of high prestige that one could normally only see on the upper floors of the Tower. And even then, Suruhtra was quite special for having been born as Surtr\u2019s child, even if it was only a low-class Demon.Riiip, crack\u2014YuWon rummaged through Suruhtra\u2019s corpse. He tore out a rib before digging into its chest until he found an empty space. Well, almost empty.\u2018There it is.\u2019He found a bright red orb. It was located around Suruhtra\u2019s heart, but it was more like a gem than a heart. This orb was both Suruhtra\u2019s heart and the source of its powers.Grasp\u2014YuWon pulled out Suruhtra\u2019s heart and firmly held it in his hand, feeling the intense heat.[Giant\u2019s Heart]\u15cc Classification : Elixir.\u15cc The heart of the Demon-Giant Suruhtra. Born in the fire nation, Suruhtra exuded the strength of a Giant and a fiery aura with this heart.\u15cc It holds a great amount of mana.\u15cc It holds the power of a Giant.The red gem was an \u2018elixir\u2019 by the name of \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart.\u300d\u2018I want to take it right now\u2026\u2019YuWon inspected the status of his body.\u2018But that might be difficult.\u2019\u300cGiant\u2019s Heart\u300d was a pretty dangerous elixir. Not only did it hold a great amount of mana, it was an elixir that changed the musculoskeletal structure of the person that consumed it. It required a great amount of stamina to intake so much power.Right now, YuWon\u2019s body was a wreck after the fight with Suruhtra. On top of that, the icy aura from the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d and \u300cIce Crystals\u300d was still inside him, so there was a great chance that the icy aura would dilute the fiery aura.\u201c\u25b7 Are you finished?\u201dYuWon turned around to see the source of the voice behind him. He replied after putting the \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart\u300d in his inventory, \u201cI\u2019m about halfway done.\u201dThe Administrator massaged his forehead. He knew what was coming.\u201cTime for me to get my reward.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 I already heard an earful from the other guys because of you, and now you\u2026\u201dThe Administrator shook his head and let out a deep sigh. He must have had a pretty big headache.\u201c\u25b7 The balance of this Tutorial is completely fucked.\u201dYet even while voicing his frustrations, the Administrator couldn\u2019t do a thing to YuWon. Administrators were beings that had to precisely follow the rules of the Tower. As long as YuWon continued to act within the rules of the Tower, his insane rampage would continue.\u201c\u25b7 Well, you are first going to go to the final area. The 4th Tutorial is currently in progress, and it\u2019s almost over.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s almost over?\u201dYuWon realized that he must have actually been passed out for a while. The 4th Tutorial\u2019s theme was a defense that lasted a whole day. He had assumed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to join the 4th Tutorial midway, but things were progressing much faster than he had anticipated.\u201cHow much time is left?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 There\u2019s four hours remaining. You can just relax and wait until then.\u201d\u201cFour hours, you say\u2026\u201dThe 5th Tutorial was the final trial required to enter the Tower. Because of that, it had the highest difficulty, as well as the longest duration.Four hours.YuWon nodded his head.\u201cOkay, that\u2019ll be enough.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 I would hope so.\u201d\u201cHas the reward been decided yet? It seems like it took you quite a bit of time.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 It took a long time to decide what to give you because I had to consult the other guys this time.\u201dThe \u201cother guys\u201d that the Administrator was referring to were probably the Administrators of other floors. That meant that this was a decision so hard, a single Administrator couldn\u2019t decide by himself.This was honestly not a surprise. Even though it was weakened from the intervention of the Tower, a \u2018newbie\u2019 that has yet to even complete the Tutorial defeated Suruhtra. In the first place, Suruhtra was meant to bring Annihilation to the Tutorial area. It was not intended to be defeated at all.[You have obtained 10000 points.][You have obtained the skill Heaven-Slaying Star.][All your stats increased by 3.]YuWon was pleasantly surprised. He hadn\u2019t anticipated that he\u2019d be given a skill.\u2018Heaven-Slaying Star?\u2019A star that slays the heavens. It was truly a grandiose name. Though, maybe the grandiose name was warranted considering YuWon had defeated the Giant Suruhtra, the Annihilation of the Tutorial.However, a skill by the name of [Heaven-Slaying Star] didn\u2019t exist within YuWon\u2019s memories.\u2018A skill I\u2019ve never heard of\u2026\u2019YuWon thought that he knew most of the high-rank skills.\u2018Well, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019The Tower never betrays one\u2019s efforts and hard work. When one perfectly passes a difficult trial, the Tower will always present them a suitable reward. That was a fundamental truth of this world that YuWon knew, and he knew this truth would remain true far into the future.\u2018I bet it\u2019s something pretty good.\u2019YuWon quickly checked his new skill.[Heaven-Slaying Star]\u15cc Rank : A+\u15cc Completion rate: 0.00%\u15cc You possess the fate and talent to slay the heavens. From here on, your fate and worth will change depending on what the life you kill is worth.\u15cc Your stats increase depending on the number of opponents killed, as well as who your opponents were.\u15cc All stats increased by 3.An A plus-rank skill. At half a rank higher than [Cinder Eyes,] it was definitely a skill that should have been impossible to obtain in the Tutorial, and it was a testament to how difficult a trial it was to defeat Suruhtra and prevent the Annihilation.YuWon found the rank satisfactory, but the effect was a bit underwhelming. Still, an increase for all stats was definitely a plus.\u2018This is definitely better than any mediocre skill.\u2019It wasn\u2019t necessarily a good thing for a skill to be high-rank. Depending on one\u2019s combat style, a lower-rank skill might be more efficient than a high-rank skill. Meanwhile, a skill that raised one\u2019s stats was useful to just about everyone.But the increase in stats wasn\u2019t the only thing that caught YuWon\u2019s attention.\u2018Completion rate\u2026\u2019YuWon looked closely at the \u2018completion rate\u2019 that was in place of \u2018proficiency.\u2019\u2018Does this mean it\u2019s not a complete skill yet?\u2019Though rare, there were growth-type items in this world that grew stronger with the user over time. However, YuWon had never heard of a growth-type skill that had a completion rate instead of proficiency.\u2018Whatever the case is, there\u2019s probably no better skill to compensate for my lack of stats.\u2019YuWon paid no mind to the 10,000 points he was rewarded.The skill started off by increasing every stat by three. This included Arcane Power for a whopping total of 15 stat points. This was a far greater change than just leveling up five times. Leveling up became increasingly difficult with higher levels, yet stats gained from the [Heaven-Slaying Star] were not connected to levels at all. So in total, it wasn\u2019t a bad reward.\u201c\u25b7 Do you require anything else?\u201dYuWon nodded at the Administrator\u2019s question.\u201cPlease give me one Lesser Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u2019\u201d\u201c\u25b7 You\u2019re not even batting an eye while buying such an expensive item.\u201dThe Administrator grumbled while handing a bright red medicine ball to YuWon.[You have spent 10000 points.][You have obtained a \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u300d]YuWon took it from him. The \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d was a far more effective item, but that wasn\u2019t something he could purchase right now, as it cost hundreds of thousands of points to buy it from the Shop.He had no choice but to be satisfied with his current purchase.\u201c\u25b7 Anything else?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it for me.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Then wait here for a bit. Take that and get some good rest.\u201dAnd with those words, the Administrator vanished.There were four hours remaining. Within that time, he had to heal from his burns and injuries while preparing for the 5th Tutorial.Crunch\u2014YuWon put the medicine ball in his mouth and started chewing. It tasted like it was made with every single bitter plant in the world.\u2018I lost too much time from fainting. I also need to consume Suruhtra\u2019s heart\u2026\u2019Gulp\u2014YuWon swallowed the \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d and sat down on the ground. He could feel a refreshing energy circulate within his body. He closed his eyes and let his heart absorb the energy of the medicine ball.[Your Arcane Power increased by 1.][Your Constitution increased by 1.][Your injuries and stamina start to recover quickly.]The \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d was a valuable elixir in any world outside the Tower. As an item that increased your Arcane Power and Constitution, it gave you a significant amount of stats the first time you consumed it.\u2018Two stats. Is that the limit?\u2019It would be a different story with a \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball,\u300d but it was useless to want more stats from the \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u300d Had YuWon taken it while he was a lower level, he might have been able to get one or two more stats from it.But YuWon didn\u2019t waste too much time wondering about what-ifs. There were plenty of ways to gather more points in the future, and gaining two stats at his level was still pretty good. Besides, the primary reason he took the medicine ball was to quickly recover from the injuries that Suruhtra inflicted on him.Taking the \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d to recover from injuries was normally only something that high rankers could do as a display of extreme wealth, but\u2026\u2018I have no choice right now.\u2019Time passed quickly.Was it because he took the medicine ball? YuWon\u2019s wreck of a body started healing rapidly.Time continued to flow.YuWon had closed his eyes waiting for the 4th Tutorial to end. He opened his eyes, instinctively feeling the will of the Tower calling for him.\u2018It\u2019s starting.\u2019YuWon got up from his spot, and at that moment\u2026Woom, wooom\u2014The air around him started to vibrate. His body floated up, and his vision started to blur. Like paint being mixed together, the sky and the ground blended into black. YuWon floated high up in the air, as if he was being separated from the world, and his sights changed.Disconnecting from this world and connecting to a different world.The world that had condensed together and turned black suddenly separated, and another world made of completely different colors appeared.The air that had turned hot from the battle with Suruhtra turned cool. The sky was clear, and there was the scent of salty ocean. And in front of YuWon, a great forest could be seen spanning the horizon.A lot of people started appearing around YuWon.\u201cWhere is this?\u201d\u201cIs this the 5th Tutorial?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people here.\u201d\u201cHow big is this place?\u201dThere were approximately a little over a hundred people.Some people were on alert, thinking that there were too many people. That was because up until now, some of the missions required people to attack each other.However, these people had no idea how different the final Tutorial would be compared to any of the other Tutorials they had faced before. They would come to learn how small the world they had been living in was.\u2018This is the first place where Tutorial participants from various worlds will gather for the first time.\u2019This was the starting point where people from an infinite number of worlds gathered for the massive world that was the Tower. And the Tutorial called this place\u2026[THE FINAL TUTORIAL WILL NOW BEGIN.]Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026 The \u201cCollective World.\u201d____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 20Chapter 20People murmured after being told that this was the final Tutorial.\u201cFinal?\u201d\u201cAs in the last one?\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s finally going to be over?\u201d\u201cNo way. It\u2019s called the \u2018Tutorial.\u2019\u201d\u201cCan you please shut up?\u201dIn the midst of the crowd, there were some people who didn\u2019t like the commotion.The messages continued.[\u2018Barrag\u00e1nda Island\u2019 is slowly sinking into the sea. There is only one condition needed to prove your worth in order to escape the island.][DEFEAT THE BOSS AT THE PEAK OF THE ISLAND.][You will be given a score depending on your contribution towards defeating the boss.][The final reward will be decided based on your score and how long it took for the boss to fall.][The time limit is 30 days.][Once the time limit passes, the island will sink completely.][TIME LIMIT : 720 : 00 : 00]\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA month?\u201dMaybe because of the unexpectedly long time limit, a lot of people voiced their shock. Up until now, the Tutorial was at most four days long, with some tutorials being as short as one hour. Therefore it couldn\u2019t be helped that they were surprised by the sudden large increase in the time limit.However, this news didn\u2019t bring chaos or anything. In fact, most people looked relieved by it, since it meant that they didn\u2019t have to raise their weapons and fight the people around them. Also, having more time was better for achieving a specific goal. However\u2026\u2018Some of them must have noticed\u2026\u2019YuWon saw that a few people in the crowd were tensing up rather than relaxing.\u2018\u2026 Why we were given such a long time limit.\u2019A month\u2019s time. It was so much time that the duration was long enough for people to get complacent. However, they weren\u2019t given a month for nothing. It meant that they had a month to get as strong as possible in order to achieve their objective, which was a single boss. Most of them couldn\u2019t even fathom how strong the boss had to be.Maybe it was because these were people that had managed to make it to the last Tutorial, but one by one, the participants started to get moving. And inevitably\u2026\u201cYou all heard that? I think it was meant for us to meet up like this. Why don\u2019t we form a team together?\u201d\u2026 Things started off with people forming groups.\u201cShould we?\u201d\u201cThat sounds good to me. Why don\u2019t we take this opportunity to learn each other\u2019s names\u2026\u201d\u201cI refuse.\u201dAn authoritative voice rang through the area, capturing everyone\u2019s attention. YuWon also shifted his sights to the source of the voice.\u2018Right. He was here as well.\u2019It was a blonde-haired, golden-eyed man wrapped in a white cloth. His white outfit looked out of place in the chaos of the Tutorial.The man\u2019s name was Hargaan.Hargaan looked at his surroundings with an arrogant look on his face.\u201cWho said you could just become my comrade? A comrade should be someone I can trust my sides and back with. That\u2019s why I\u2019ll pick my own comrades.\u201dHargaan mocked the people whose attention he garnered.\u201cBy the looks of it, I don\u2019t think you guys are worthy of being my comrades.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d\u201cYou arrogant prick\u2026\u201dWhen a guy standing next to Hargaan took a step towards him\u2026Flash\u2014Rumble, crash\u2014!\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cKugh\u2026!\u201dWith a yellow electric blast, every single person around Hargaan was sent flying into the air.\u201cW-What the fuck!\u201d\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201cWas that a skill?\u201dIt was a very powerful electric attack, annihilating everyone within a five meter radius.Despite having just made enemies out of almost a hundred participants, Hargaan looked unconcerned.\u201cYou guys are nothing but cannon fodder.\u201dCrackle, crackle\u2014Around Hargaan, an electric field made from an immense amount of mana continued to convulse around him.Even in the lower floors of the Tower, it was rare to see someone with this much Arcane Power, but Hargaan was no normal Tutorial participant.\u2018The self-proclaimed successor of Olympus. A descendant of Zeus.\u2019He was a being of a different class compared to your average Tutorial participants.\u2018So that\u2019s the power of a Pure-Blood.\u2019Pure-Bloods referred to beings that were selected to climb the Tower after being born and raised inside the Tower.Pure-Bloods had already experienced the Tower\u2019s magnificence from the moment they were born, so it was only natural that they possessed far greater power compared to people who had only just been selected to participate in the Tutorial.\u2018And thus the fairness of this game ends here.\u2019Some might disagree, but the Tutorial had been pretty fair up to this point. The stats that each individual had might have differed, but at least they had lived through the same world under similar circumstances. However, that was no longer the case starting with the final Tutorial, and this of course applied throughout the Tower as well.Some entered the Tower having already experienced the magical nature of the Tower as a Pure-Blood, while others entered the Tower possessing magical abilities that were impossible for a normal human to have. And among those people, Hargaan was someone that was set to inherit the power of Olympus. That\u2019s why it was only natural that he was powerful, even for a Pure-Blood.\u2018To already be this strong at the start of the 5th Tutorial\u2026\u2019YuWon nodded his head,\u2018No wonder he got the Tower\u2019s attention.\u2019Hargaan was a participant that had received the Tower\u2019s attention during YuWon\u2019s first time through the Tutorial. Not only was he an Olympus Pure-Blood, he was a descendant of Zeus, becoming known as the participant that had inherited the power of thunder. That\u2019s why when the Tutorial ended, many different guilds inside the Tower paid close attention to see how fast he\u2019d become a Ranker.\u2018He was also the one who made the biggest contribution in defeating the boss during my previous life.\u2019YuWon quickly finished reminiscing about the past and decided to stop paying attention to Hargaan. YuWon had no intention of getting too involved with him.\u201cHuh?\u201d Hargaan remarked. In the midst of exuding electricity to threaten those around him, he spotted YuWon. While everyone else was standing still, paying close attention to him, YuWon was walking away somewhere.\u201cHey, you!\u201d shouted Hargaan, looking at YuWon.YuWon stopped in his tracks and turned his head. In an instant, Hargaan had walked over to YuWon and now stood right in front of him.\u201cAre you talking to me?\u201d YuWon said.\u201cWhat are you?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a Pyromancy Robe?\u201dHaving resided in the Tower for a long time, Hargaan seemed to know about the \u300cPyromancy Robe.\u300d Although, that wasn\u2019t very surprising. Olympus was a group full of Rankers, so Hargaan had probably seen the robe during his time in Olympus.YuWon answered, \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d while thinking about how things might have been about to get annoying.\u201cHow did you get this? This item shouldn\u2019t be something you can obtain in the tutorial.\u201d\u201cI bought it. With points.\u201d\u201cYou bought it\u2026?\u201dYuWon\u2019s short answer as if it was an easy and obvious thing put a confused look on Hargaan\u2019s face. It was a face that was saying, \u2018How did you buy such an expensive item with points?\u2019On the other hand, Hargaan was also equipped with items far better than what the average participant could ever have.\u2018Though they\u2019re nothing compared to the Pyromancy Robe,\u2019 thought YuWon.Hargaan showed a sudden interest in YuWon, realizing that the man who was wearing the \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d was different from the other participants.\u201cWhat\u2019s your level?\u201d asked Hargaan.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that it\u2019s impolite to ask someone their level?\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 You\u2019re not wrong\u2026 But is that already a common practice in the Tutorial?\u201d Hargaan asked while scratching his head. He then nodded his head, saying, \u201cOkay. I understand. I won\u2019t ask about your level again. Instead, would you like to form a team with me?\u201dThe \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d must have seriously piqued Hargaan\u2019s interest. His face looked like he was waiting for YuWon to say yes. Hargaan must have thought that YuWon would definitely accept his offer since YuWon should have seen his display of might.A Pure-Blood that knew who Hargaan was would have probably accepted his offer. Even though he didn\u2019t have \u2018the System\u2019s Blessing\u2019 until recently, as he had yet to climb the Tower, Hargaan was a Pure-Blood from Olympus, of all places. That meant that his nature of potential was of a different caliber.However\u2026\u201cNot particularly. See ya.\u201d\u2026 YuWon didn\u2019t find much merit in Hargaan\u2019s offer.\u201c\u2026?\u201dHargaan blinked in silence as if he had become mute. Never could he have imagined having his offer turned down after showing off his skills.YuWon walked straight past Hargaan after giving him his answer.\u2018Is this because he doesn\u2019t know who I am?\u2019 Hargaan thought while turning his head to look at YuWon.\u201cWait. I\u2019m\u2026\u201dBut YuWon was already far off in the distance.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201dWith his pride damaged from being ignored, Hargaan frowned as he tensed up his calves.Krshhh\u2014Hargaan imbued the power of thunder into his legs before running after YuWon in a fury.Rrrumble\u2014!\u201cStop right there\u2014!\u201dHargaan chased after YuWon for a while.He wondered how long he\u2019d been running for.Every once in a while, a monster would attack him, but Hargaan was able to blow it up in an instant before continuing to chase after YuWon.\u201cHuff, huff\u2014\u201dBut Hargaan eventually gave up on chasing YuWon, deciding to rest and catch his breath. The distance between the two had widened to a point where Hargaan could no longer see YuWon.\u2018How is he so fast?\u2019Hargaan was absolutely bamboozled. How was he unable to catch up, even though he had run with everything he had? Hargaan didn\u2019t think YuWon was using some sort of special skill that raised his movement speed. Because if that was the case, there was no way he would have failed to detect the flow of mana.That could only mean one thing.\u2018How high are his stats\u2026?\u2019It meant that YuWon had been running solely using the power of his stats.Hargaan was speechless.\u2018Is that guy also a Pure-Blood?\u2019But to be faster than him, who was an Olympus Pure-Blood\u2026\u2018Let\u2019s see. Who were some fast groups? Maybe he\u2019s from Elforado. Or maybe he\u2019s an expert from the martial realm? Or could he maybe be a descendant of Hermes?\u2019After thinking for a minute, Hargaan decided to just let it go, since he\u2019d get nowhere by just thinking about it alone. But there was one thing Hargaan was sure of\u2026\u201cAnd here I was, thinking that this was going to be boring\u2026\u201dKrshhh\u2014Hargaan grinned widely and let a bit of electric current flow out of him. His golden eyes stared out in the direction that YuWon disappeared to.\u201cThis is going to be interesting.\u201d* * *\u2018Did I lose him?\u2019 thought YuWon.Seeing that Hargaan was no longer following him, YuWon finally stopped running.It had taken five minutes for YuWon to lose him. It was no wonder that Hargaan went around claiming to be Zeus\u2019s successor.\u2018He really is fast.\u2019The electric attack he showed off was quite a threat, but his running speed was really something. His physical abilities were astounding for someone who had only just finished the 4th Tutorial. And from what YuWon remembered, his specialty wasn\u2019t speed, but extreme brute force which utilized his electric powers.Hargaan was strong even for a Pure-Blood, possessing enough power to completely ruin the ecosystem of the Tutorial.YuWon had a flashback of something the Administrator had said.\u201c\u25b7 The balance of this Tutorial is completely fucked.\u201dYuWon realized that maybe the Administrator wasn\u2019t just talking about him.Hargaan, an Olympus Pure-Blood, was already enough to bring chaos to the Tutorial\u2019s ecosystem, but the Administrator also had YuWon running around and doing whatever he pleased.\u2018Not that that\u2019s any of my problem.\u2019YuWon found a cave inside the forest. And inside the cave there were dozens of Gnolls inhabiting it. Gnolls were monsters with the heads of wolves.YuWon slayed all of them and took the cave for himself.[You have defeated a Gnoll.][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 0.001%.][You have defeated a Gnoll.][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate\u2026][You have obtained 3cp.*]*TL/N: CP = contribution pointsAfter killing a few Gnolls, the completion rate for [Heaven-Slaying Star] increased by a little bit. It was a really little bit. After killing dozens of Gnolls, the completion rate wasn\u2019t even 0.01%.\u2018I\u2019ll have to kill the creatures in higher locations if I want to properly raise the completion rate.\u2019However, YuWon\u2019s objective for finding this cave wasn\u2019t to hunt monsters.YuWon sprinkled the \u300cScentless Powder\u300d he had purchased earlier at the entrance and deep inside the cave. He did this to prevent other monsters from detecting his scent and coming inside.\u2018I think that should do it.\u2019He had consumed the \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d and recovered his body more than sufficiently. On top of that, the icy aura from the \u300cArctic Steel Sword\u300d and \u300cIce Crystals\u300d was all gone now. YuWon had finished preparing as much as he could.YuWon inserted his hand inside his inventory and pulled out a bright red crystal.[Giant\u2019s Heart]Along with the [Heaven-Slaying Star,] it was one of the prizes YuWon gained from defeating Suruhtra.In fact, the \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart\u300d was the most valuable elixir that was possible to obtain in the Tutorial.\u201cListen closely, Kim YuWon.\u201dYuWon took a deep breath and opened his mouth wide.Finally\u2026\u201cThe Giant\u2019s Heart has to\u2014\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euCrunch\u2014YuWon chewed and ate the crimson gem.\u201c\u2014be consumed before the Tutorial is over.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So hot that YuWon thought he was going to go mad.The \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d that YuWon was wearing had no effect. If it weren\u2019t for the fire resistance from [Cinder Eyes,] it might have felt like his internal organs were melting.\u201cFuuuu\u2014\u201dWhile squirming on the ground, YuWon exhaled a breath of hot air. He rolled around the floor, back and forth, flailing all around. His body was burning hot. His bones and muscles felt like they were churning, and his blood felt like it was flowing backwards.It went on for who knows how many hours.[Cinder Eyes is resisting Flames of the Giants.][Cinder Eyes failed to resist Flames of the Giants.]As YuWon had expected, [Cinder Eyes] alone wasn\u2019t enough. This damned blood was excruciatingly hot. Had YuWon not been in good condition, he might have already lost his mind and fainted. Unfortunately, there was no way to make this pain go away. The only option was to endure it with mental fortitude.\u201cGiant\u2019s blood is something you normally cover yourself in, not something you eat.\u201dIt was a warning he had received from Hercules, the Slayer of Giants.\u201cEating that during the Tutorial is basically suicide, so no matter what, you need to first obtain Cinder Eyes. If you somehow fail to get the Cinder Eyes, give up on the heart.\u201dFortunately, YuWon had managed to obtain [Cinder Eyes.] However, the pain was still agonizing. It just wasn\u2019t to a degree that would kill him.\u201cYou will only get one chance.\u201dThat\u2019s right. YuWon only had this one chance. That\u2019s why he had to endure it.\u2018Take in as much power as you can.\u2019If he wanted to ease the pain, he could always expel the power that was entering his body with mana. It was a pretty difficult and tedious thing to do, but that much control over mana would have been a piece of cake for YuWon. However, he chose not to do that.[Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Constitution increased by 1.][Your Strength increased\u2026]His stats continued to rise. Though it was mostly Strength and Constitution that increased, Arcane Power also increased by a little bit.Giant\u2019s blood and Demon\u2019s blood both thoroughly seeped into YuWon\u2019s body.Crack, kk-crack\u2014His body started reforming as his musculoskeletal structure shifted.Even more time passed.[Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Constitution increased\u2026]YuWon\u2019s stats increased slowly and steadily. YuWon wondered how much he might have gained in stats. Normally, level-up messages were very much welcomed, but YuWon wasn\u2019t all that pleased.\u2018It should be coming along any moment now\u2026\u2019What YuWon wanted wasn\u2019t a few measly stats. What he was after was a skill that was worth dozens of stats. That was the hidden piece YuWon was after.[Cinder Eyes and Flames of the Giants are clashing.][You are able to control Flames of the Giants through Cinder Eyes.][You have fulfilled the conditions for the hidden piece.][You have obtained Colossal Fire.]This was an unexpected situation. YuWon didn\u2019t know if he should be happy or not.\u201cWhat\u2026 even is\u2026 Colossal Fire\u2026?\u201dDespite the pain, YuWon was so baffled he couldn\u2019t help but let out an empty laugh.The skill he wanted didn\u2019t appear, and instead he became able to control fire through [Cinder Eyes.] It was definitely a plus, but this would have all been for naught if he wasn\u2019t able to obtain the skill he was after.[Time limit : 707 : 54 : 29]Half a day had already passed by.YuWon had gained quite a bit in stats, but these weren\u2019t the results he had in mind.\u2018Were we wrong?\u2019It wasn\u2019t really a surprise. In order to obtain this skill normally, you needed to kill and get drenched in the blood of ten thousand Giants.YuWon did obtain the \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart\u300d within the Tutorial, but it was still a pretty unlikely theory to try.\u2018I guess I should be happy with this\u2026\u2019YuWon couldn\u2019t endure it anymore. Slowly, his vision went dark, and his mind fell into a deep sleep.YuWon wondered how long he was unconscious for.When he opened his eyes, he felt that truly anything could happen in the Tutorial.[You have fully absorbed the \u2018Lifeblood of Giants and Demons.\u2019][You perfectly consumed the \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart\u300d within the Tutorial.][You have fulfilled the conditions for the hidden piece.][You obtained Gigantification.]YuWon\u2019s eyes widened. The message he was waiting for finally appeared.\u201cI\u2026 did it\u2026\u201dYuWon finally unclenched his teeth.First after the fight with Suruhtra and a second time just now. YuWon had fainted a total of two times already.\u2018What\u2019s the time\u2026?\u2019[Time limit : 696 : 18 : 48]Looking at the time, YuWon guessed that he had blacked out for about half a day.Almost a day had already passed since the 5th Tutorial started.\u2018Quite a bit of time has passed.\u2019A time limit of 30 days. Most people viewed it as plenty of time, but that didn\u2019t apply to YuWon.\u2018I need to finish this as fast as I can.\u2019As far as YuWon knew, the fastest clear record for the final Tutorial was one week. It was a record established by Odin.Odin was part of the 1st Generation that recorded the start of the Tower. He led the Giant faction of Asgard, and he was the greatest magic fighter that YuWon knew.\u2018I won\u2019t lose to him.\u2019Everyone was a competitor in the 5th Tutorial. Every single action you do gets converted into contribution points. From hunting, to the hidden piece, as well as special quests. You are scored on all these different factors and ranked accordingly.However, YuWon didn\u2019t consider any of them his competitors because YuWon\u2019s mind was preoccupied by beings that were far higher. His true competitors were the Rankers of this tall Tower that absolutely dominated the rankings in their respective Tutorials.[Rankings][1st \u2013 Hargaan : 1036cp][2nd \u2013 Yolche : 689cp][3rd \u2013 Paladinte : 637cp][4th \u2013 Lee SungYoon : 514cp][5th \u2013 Elador : 451cp][\u2026\u2026]There was already a big divide within the rankings. The biggest share of contribution points would be awarded from defeating the boss, but within the 5th Tutorial, you could also gain CP from normal hunting.First place was, of course, Hargaan. He had created a dominating lead over second place.While looking over the rankings, YuWon noticed some familiar names.\u2018Elador and Paladinte are both Pantemium-affiliated Rankers. They probably participated in the Tutorial from worlds that are at least two tiers higher\u2026 And Yolche. Is he a Pure-Blood? I\u2019ve never heard of him.\u2019YuWon actually didn\u2019t know every participant in the Tutorial. During his first time around, he was a part of a 10-man group, and Hargaan ended up defeating the boss while he was still hunting.\u2018As for Lee SungYoon\u2026\u2019Despite being born in the same world as YuWon, he had managed to rank between two Pure-Blood participants from worlds full of magic and swordsmanship.\u2018I never heard of him either.\u2019No matter how much he racked his brain, YuWon couldn\u2019t remember anyone named Lee SungYoon. It\u2019s not like he knew the name of every single Ranker, but there was no way he wouldn\u2019t know a Ranker from the same world as him, and especially one that participated in the same Tutorial.\u2018Maybe he died here.\u2019YuWon scratched his head while checking the rankings. He realized nothing would come from thinking too hard. Unless he was going to actually team up with some of them, it didn\u2019t matter to him what rank people were.\u2018I wasted too much time.\u2019YuWon checked his condition one last time.[Name : Kim YuWon][Level : 57][Strength : 72][Dexterity : 51][Constitution : 65][Perception : 47][Arcane Power : 60][Total Points : 5400][Unallocated Stat Points : 0][Skills Possessed][Basic Arcane Sword, Mana Blast, Cinder Eyes, Colossal Fire, Gigantification] \u2013 DetailsTL/N: Uhm, I\u2019m not sure why the raws are excluding Master of Mana and Heaven-Slaying Star.Level 57. He had achieved it after leveling up five times from killing the Skulls and Suruhtra. And with his total stats being almost 300, he was actually very powerful for his level.\u2018My Strength and Constitution are too high.\u2019YuWon didn\u2019t like his stats being too lopsided. The combat style he aimed for was an all-rounder. Because unless you were aiming to push ahead with just pure strength like Hercules, it was better to have a nice balance among all your stats.\u2018As for Colossal Fire\u2026\u2019YuWon took a close look at the mysterious new skill he obtained.[Colossal Fire]\u15cc Rank : B-\u15cc Proficiency : 0.00%\u15cc Fire kin are born with fire within them. The small fire within them will not extinguish even after death, remaining for a long time, and gets passed onto future generations.\u15cc The power of the skill will increase with proficiency and Arcane Power.A B minus-rank skill.It wasn\u2019t all that bad. In fact, it was pretty good. [Colossal Fire] was a skill that made up for YuWon\u2019s lack of an AOE* attack.*PR/N : Area of Effect. AOE abilities cause an effect/damage within a certain area.\u2018This should be usable.\u2019Other participants might have flipped out over [Colossal Fire,] but YuWon wasn\u2019t particularly impressed. It was simply usable, and that was about it. A skill of this caliber wasn\u2019t enough for YuWon, who had been fighting against Outer Gods.Step\u2014YuWon stepped out of the cave for the first time in 24 hours. The sun was right above him. YuWon was blinded from being in the dark for so long.\u2018Now, let\u2019s see\u2026\u2019Fwoosh\u2014YuWon activated [Cinder Eyes] and started looking around the forest. His range of vision expanded, and he was able to see things he previously couldn\u2019t. [Cinder Eyes] was able to make what couldn\u2019t be seen visible according to YuWon\u2019s will.Dash\u2014YuWon warmed up his feet and started getting a move on.YuWon followed the first track he spotted as soon as he came out. And that led him to\u2026\u201cTchwik, tchwee\u2014\u201d\u201cTchweek*\u2014!\u201d*PR/N: Pig sfx in KoreanA horde of monsters with gruesome cries.With the head of a pig and green skin, they were monsters called Orcs.\u201cAn Orc tribe\u2026\u201dIt was a huge hunting ground with hundreds of Orcs. This was adequate to be YuWon\u2019s first hunting ground.\u201cWon\u2019t be a bad place to test out my skill.\u201dThe stage of the final Tutorial, Barrag\u00e1nda, was absolutely massive. The size of the island was big enough to be a small nation.And on this island, there were plenty of hunting grounds. There was even a spot YuWon already had in mind. The Orc tribe was simply a pit stop along the way.\u201cTchweek, tchwik?\u201d\u201cHuman-tchwik. It\u2019s a human-tchwik!\u201d\u201cPrey-tchwik!\u201dThe Orcs spotted YuWon.Orcs were one of the rare monsters in the lower floors that actually possessed intelligence. That\u2019s why they were able to form tribes, and it made them tricky to hunt for the amount of EXP they gave.Of course, that last part didn\u2019t really apply to YuWon.Fwoosh\u2014Fwoooosh\u2014Fire spread to all sides.The armed and drooling Orcs that had approached YuWon had fallen into chaos.\u201cTchweek!

    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 22Chapter 22\u2018It\u2019s him.\u2019The guy that suddenly climbed up the rankings.Hargaan took a close look at the name \u2018Kim YuWon,\u2019 which was now ranked second.\u201cSo he\u2019s coming up.\u201dThat person had jumped up high on the leaderboard in no time. Though Hargaan didn\u2019t actually know his name, he was pretty sure. It was him.\u2018I thought he was just some guy that was really fast at running because none of these guys were catching my eyes.\u2019Hargaan grinned softly. The day the final Tutorial started, he was surprised and baffled by the fact that there was a participant that he couldn\u2019t match in speed. However, this also excited Hargaan.Who was he? What powers did he possess? Could he be someone that could fight and rival him? And could he become his comrade?Seeing Hargaan\u2019s face, a man that was following him asked, \u201cWhat are you finding so amusing?\u201dIt was Lee SungYoon, the newest participant to join Hargaan\u2019s \u2018team.\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s a guy that I want to recruit no matter what.\u201d\u201cIs it Kim YuWon?\u201d\u201cDo you know him?\u201dNow that he thought about it, he realized that Kim YuWon and Lee SungYoon were from the same world. Their names were similar, and the fact that they both had talent was also similar.Lee SungYoon. He was exceptionally talented among the participants from the world line called Earth. Though his physical abilities were so-so, his talent for controlling mana was uncommon, even in the Tower.Not only did he start off with 12 Arcane Power as soon as he awakened his Arcane Power stat, he was already capable of using [Mana Blast] in the 5th Tutorial. Even in the history of the Tutorial, there weren\u2019t many participants who were capable of such a feat.\u2018He\u2019s definitely full of talent.\u2019Earth was a planet inhabited by the weakest humans among the world lines. However, Hargaan had already discovered two monsters from there by the names of Kim YuWon and Lee SungYoon.SungYoon replied while shrugging his shoulders, \u201cNot likely. I think he\u2019s from the same country as me, but I\u2019ve never heard of him. I just knew who you were talking about as soon as I saw the updated ranking.\u201cAt this rate, he might overtake your spot, sir. The gap in CP between you and him is shrinking fast.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s because of you guys,\u201d Hargaan said while looking back at the comrades following behind him.Paladinte, Elador, Yolche, Lee SungYoon, and five others. A total of nine people formed a line behind Hargaan.\u201cThe real hunt starts now,\u201d declared Hargaan.On the first day, Hargaan\u2019s focus wasn\u2019t on hunting. It was on gathering good comrades and forming a team. And he wanted to raise that team so they could climb the Tower together.\u2018This is a pretty good team,\u2019 thought Hargaan.He had taken a big liking to the group he had formed. They were each highly skilled, and their levels were pretty high. Best of all, their various aptitudes and positions synergized well together.Of course, the reason why these people could be gathered into one group was due to Hargaan\u2019s dominating strength and background.\u2018There\u2019s only one spot left.\u2019Hargaan wanted to find exactly 10 comrades during the final Tutorial, and one of those spots was already reserved for someone.\u2018So his name is Kim YuWon.\u2019Hargaan resolved himself to not let him go next time.Hargaan was lost in thought after checking the rankings, when he was interrupted by a stoic male voice.\u201cAhjussi.* That\u2019s it, right?\u201d*TL/N: Korean for \u2018mister.\u2019 It\u2019s typically used to refer to middle-aged men.\u201cHey, I told you. I\u2019m not an ahjussi.\u201dHargaan looked towards the voice with a ticked off expression.Paladinte, an Elf participant, was standing off to the side, pointing towards a hole in the middle of the forest.Hargaan knew it was somewhere around here, but it took them half a day to find it, and without Paladinte\u2019s help, it might have taken them days to find it.\u201cOkay, now let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d said Hargaan, slamming his two fists together.Bam\u2014The rest of his team spread out so they wouldn\u2019t get caught in the shockwave. Wearing golden gloves, Hargaan tightly clenched his fists, raising them up high in the air. And then\u2026Boom\u2014!Crash, rumble\u2014!Hargaan pounded the earth, and the ground gave way.Gugugugu\u2014Within the crumbled ground, a huge hole opened up.Hargaan smiled as he exclaimed, \u201cI found it!\u201dBarrag\u00e1nda, the Tutorial island. The center region of this island was filled to the brim with various dangerous monsters and hidden pieces. However, the problem was that the entrances to the central region were hidden across the island.Vzzzt\u2014The electricity around Hargaan\u2019s hands lit up the inside of the hole. Without hesitation, he threw himself down the hole, slowing his descent by scraping the walls with his hands.At the bottom of the hole, the ceiling was covered in bright stones.\u201cIs this it? The place you\u2019ve been trying so hard to find?\u201d\u201cIt looks very spacious\u2026\u201d\u201cIt looks like a cave.\u201dHargaan\u2019s teammates followed him into the hole and looked around the cave. They had thought it was just a large island. They didn\u2019t expect there to be a place like this.Having found an entrance, Paladinte ordered his spirits to scout around. He then looked back at Hargaan.\u201cWe should first scout it out before we start moving\u2026 Ahjussi, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dHargaan, who was smiling widely when they first entered, now looked stoic. He didn\u2019t answer Paladinte\u2019s question because something was really off.\u2018That\u2019s odd.\u2019He was sure that a message should have popped up. He waited for the message, but there was nothing but silence. He tried listening closer, but there was still nothing. That could only mean one thing.\u201cDid\u2026 someone already find this place?\u201dThere were no signs of someone having already entered through the entrance they had found, but there was more than a single entrance for this dungeon. This was a massive dungeon under the island, and it was unknown how many entrances to this place existed.\u2018But to have already found this place when it\u2019s only been a few days\u2026\u2019\u201cCaptain!\u201d shouted SungYoon. \u201cThe rankings! Please check the rankings!\u201d\u201cThe rankings?\u201dAt first Hargaan was confused, but then his eyes widened. He immediately checked the rankings.[1st \u2013 Kim YuWon : 5679cp][2nd \u2013 Hargaan : 5539cp]He was able to see that within that short time, their positions had flipped.Boom, crash\u2014!Rumble\u2014A volley of electric attacks exploded, shaking the cave.The centipede-like monsters that had appeared out of nowhere were blown up and shredded in an instant.Crash\u2014Hargaan punched the air, and once again the sound of thunder echoed through the cave, shaking the earth.\u201cHe seems pretty pissed.\u201dPaladinte and Elador walked together, arm-in-arm, watching the electric attacks fly out from Hargaan. His physical abilities and electric attacks were truly terrifying. Despite not being the target of his attacks, they could still feel light shocks.\u201cHe seems less pissed and just really motivated to me,\u201d said SungYoon.Elador tilted her head after hearing SungYoon\u2019s words. She stared at him intensely, her blue eyes juxtaposing her grey skin.\u201cYou think it\u2019s rivalry?\u201d\u201cYeah, something like that.\u201dSungYoon tried to calm down his heart. Whenever he got to see her face up close, his heart started beating like a drum.Elador was an Elf. And on top of that, she was a biracial child between a fair-skinned Elf and dark Elf. With clear skin devoid of any imperfection, exotic blue eyes, and long ears, SungYoon thought she was more beautiful than any woman he could ever imagine.\u201cBut we won\u2019t be able to hunt properly like this,\u201d said Yolche. She was a woman that kept her eyes closed, and had long black hair that reached her waist.SungYoon and the rest of the team nodded their heads in agreement. Regardless of motivation, a normal hunt couldn\u2019t happen while Hargaan discriminately killed all the monsters by himself.\u201cLet\u2019s split the team in half,\u201d suggested Hargaan. After quickly finishing his hunt, he spoke while wiping the sweat on his forehead with the back of his hand. \u201cYolche, SungYoon, Elador, Fayle, and Typhoon.\u201dThe members that Hargaan named looked at him as he continued.\u201cSince we\u2019re at a crossroad, you guys go right. Elador and Paladinte can lead the way for each group and also keep us in contact with each other.\u201d\u201cYou really think the five of them will be okay by themselves?\u201d asked Paladinte.Hargaan responded, \u201cThey\u2019ll have Yolche.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 That\u2019s true,\u201d answered Paladinte, while looking at Yolche, who was already headed down the right path.She was a Pure-Blood like Hargaan, and she was a mercenary from a clan that specialized in magic. As she was the second strongest person in the team after Hargaan, she was definitely trustworthy.Yolche and the others went down the path on the right and started hunting. Even though they no longer had Hargaan, they were able to hunt without any issues.Up until now, Yolche had been holding back in order to not get caught up in Hargaan\u2019s electric attacks. She finally unsheathed her two swords and weaved in between the monsters.Swoosh, slash\u2014\u201cKkieeegh\u2014!\u201dDozens of centipedes cried simultaneously, and SungYoon pointed the palm of his hand at them.[Mana Blast]Whirrrr\u2014Mana started condensing, forming a [Mana Blast.] Yolche and Elador had bought time for SungYoon to prepare a big attack.\u201cPlease get out of the way!\u201dBoooom\u2014!The [Mana Blast] wiped out the entire area, blowing up the centipedes to smithereens. It took a lot of mana to use, but its power more than made up for it.In an instant, the pack of centipedes had been decimated, and SungYoon let out a deep breath.\u201cPhew\u2026\u201dCurrently, three shots was the max number of [Mana Blasts] he was capable of firing. Since he just fired one off, he now had to start conserving his mana.\u201cGood job.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s keep going like this.\u201dAt first, the hunt progressed smoothly. The group used the same method to hunt for hours. However, as time went on, the number of the centipede-like monsters increased, and the number of legs they had also increased.\u201cYolche!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re targeting the rear!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t stray from the front! Maintain your positions!\u201dThe hunt started to get tougher and tougher. That meant that the amount of EXP and CP they gained increased, but in terms of quantity and toughness, the centipedes were on a different level from the monsters above ground.\u201cPhew.\u201d\u201cThis just keeps getting tougher.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that door over there? It\u2019s massive.\u201dBeyond the horde of centipedes, a five meter tall, giant steel door could be seen. It was the first door that had appeared after half a day in the dungeon.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s like a boss room?\u201d\u201cBoss room?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s similar to a game\u2026 So, I\u2019ve experienced a dungeon similar to this before, and there was always a boss inside doors like that.\u201dSungYoon was recollecting a video game he played long ago, but Yolche ended up thinking that he must have been a mercenary like her, if not an adventurer, which changed her opinion of him.The group decided to take a short break.SungYoon gathered his breath, focusing on recovering his mana, but he also continuously checked the rankings.[1st \u2013 Kim YuWon : 7149cp][2nd \u2013 Hargaan : 7081cp]YuWon\u2019s lead was starting to grow shorter. It was because Hargaan\u2019s hunting speed was absolutely ridiculous. He also encountered a hunting ground with an excess of monsters at a good time, so he was collecting CP left and right.But SungYoon thought that something felt off.\u2018I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gone up for a while now\u2026\u2019YuWon\u2019s rapidly increasing CP stopped increasing at some point. Thanks to that, Hargaan was able to start catching up, and now they were at less than 100cp from each other.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d asked Yolche.\u201cPardon?\u201d SungYoon was caught off guard by Yolche\u2019s question.\u201cN-Nothing,\u201d he answered.\u201cDon\u2019t get too relaxed just because we finished hunting. You\u2019re usually closest to death when lowering your guard.\u201d\u201cI understand\u2026\u201dWhile replying to Yolche, SungYoon\u2019s eyes widened.Seeing the sudden change in his expression, Yolche asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cThe rankings\u2026\u201d\u201cThe rankings?\u201dRumble\u2014!The ground of the cave started shaking. It was a tremor that felt like something heavy had just dropped.\u201cW-What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s coming from that side.\u201dThe group stopped their break and started moving once again.The shock had definitely originated from inside the doors.\u201cEveryone, raise your guards. And SungYoon. Go to the back and hold your position,\u201d directed Yolche.SungYoon nodded at her orders. He had a hunch that this tremor wasn\u2019t unrelated to the CP rankings he had just seen.[1st \u2013 Kim YuWon : 10149cp]And just as he had expected.Creeeeak\u2014\u201cW-What is this?\u201d\u201cWho in the world\u2026?\u201dWhat was awaiting the group that entered the depths of the dungeon was\u2026[You have entered the boss room.][The boss room has been cleared.]Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euA mountain of centipede corpses, as well as the corpse of the boss that was dozens of meters long.\u201cYou guys were a bit late.\u201dAnd at the top of all those corpses\u2026\u201cI just killed this guy.\u201d\u2026 A person that looked like he had killed all these centipedes by himself was chilling.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 23Chapter 23Thud\u2014The boss of the dungeon collapsed. YuWon, who was riding on top of it, showed his distaste.\u201cSo fucking tenacious.\u201dThe monster with hundreds of legs was commonly referred to as a \u2018Parasite Dragon\u2019 in the Tower. And despite its insect-like appearance, it was very hard to kill. Because of that, it took YuWon almost 30 minutes to defeat it.Still, thanks to that, he was able to level up.[You have leveled up.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Dexterity increased by 1.][Your Arcane Power increased by 1.]\u2018I\u2019ll have to be careful using Gigantification. The mana consumption aside, it\u2019s too straining on my body with my current Constitution.\u2019YuWon had gained a lot from defeating this boss. On top of leveling up, he was able to go all out with his arsenal of skills, letting him get a proper grasp of his current fighting power.\u2018This should do it.\u2019Having defeated the Parasite Dragon, he had fulfilled his second objective for this dungeon. And on top of that, there was an unexpected bonus.[You have obtained 3000cp from clearing the boss room.][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 1%.]To get only 1% from defeating such a tough boss. However, this was the first time [Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s] completion rate increased so much. He had only gotten a total of 2% from killing thousands of monsters in the past few days.\u2018Does the completion rate go up faster if I kill higher class monsters?\u2019YuWon was sure now that it wasn\u2019t just about how many monsters he killed.\u2018The completion rate is going up very slowly. I wonder if I have to focus on killing bosses in order for me to properly complete this skill.\u2019Except for the initial stat boost it gave, the [Heaven-Slaying Star] hadn\u2019t demonstrated any effects. It did say in the skill description that it would give additional stats depending on the completion rate, but there was no way to know how much it would give.\u2018One thing\u2019s for sure\u2014I have to complete the skill to see its full effect.\u2019YuWon sat down on top of the giant centipede\u2019s corpse and started massaging his right arm. Seeing as how he needed more Constitution, he couldn\u2019t help but appreciate a skill that would raise his stats.Creeeeak\u2014From the opposite side of the room that YuWon entered from, the steel door opened, and a group of participants came in.\u201cW-What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWho in the world\u2026?\u201dThey were shocked from seeing the state of the boss room, which was honestly a normal reaction. There were hundreds of dead centipede monsters, not to mention the corpse of the giant boss that resembled a dragon. The room was nothing but full of surprises.\u2018They were lucky,\u2019 thought YuWon.This was a hidden dungeon inside the final Tutorial area. YuWon didn\u2019t know how they managed to get in here, but he could get a rough estimate of their abilities just by looking at them.\u2018Had they arrived here before me, they would have been wiped out\u2026 No, maybe only a few of them would have died, and the rest might have escaped.\u2019YuWon squinted his eyes, observing each of them. There were some familiar faces.\u2018Isn\u2019t that Elador? She\u2019s usually with Paladinte. And that guy\u2026\u2019YuWon spotted a participant that looked Korean like him.\u2018Is that Lee SungYoon?\u2019They were all fairly high ranked participants. For them to be in a team together\u2026 It was an interesting party.\u201cYou guys are a bit late,\u201d said YuWon.Alerted by his words, the party that was looking around the boss room spotted YuWon.YuWon continued, \u201cThis guy. He just died.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d\u201cYou killed all of them by yourself?\u201dEveryone in the party tensed up, preparing for a fight. It was unavoidable that they found YuWon a threat when he cleared a boss room by himself.\u2018Could the captain also do this?\u2019 SungYoon thought while looking around at the monster corpses in the room.Shrouding himself in golden electricity, Hargaan was capable of killing a dozen monsters with a single punch. He claimed himself to be the strongest person in this Tutorial, and all his teammates agreed after seeing his skills.However, the doubt still lingered in SungYoon\u2019s mind. Would Hargaan also have been able to clear the boss room by himself?\u2018That mark\u2026\u2019 thought SungYoon, noticing a huge hole in the ground.He was puzzled. How were these the skills of a participant who grew up in the same world and went through the same Tutorials as him?SungYoon gulped. The man standing in front of him was a wild beast.* * *\u201cAre you perhaps Kim YuWon?\u201d asked SungYoon, remembering how YuWon\u2019s CP had shot up just a moment ago.YuWon nodded his head. There was no reason for him to keep it a secret.\u201cDo you have any party members?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alone, as you can see.\u201dHearing YuWon\u2019s answer, SungYoon finally understood why Hargaan wanted him so badly.At first, SungYoon couldn\u2019t believe it. How could someone from the same world as him hold as much power as Hargaan? And after joining Hargaan\u2019s party and hearing about his life, SungYoon became even more skeptical that YuWon\u2019s skills were on par with Hargaan. However\u2026\u2018It was true,\u2019 thought SungYoon. And he wondered what might happen if YuWon joined their team.Hargaan and Kim YuWon. Yolche and the two Elf warriors, Elador and Paladinte. They were among the strongest people in the Tutorial.Hargaan wanted to form a team, a team that could be led to the top of the Tower, that would become Rankers together, and receive recognition from Olympus. That was why Hargaan wanted YuWon so badly.\u201cWould you like to join our team?\u201d asked SungYoon.Hargaan had left a spot empty for YuWon. And now SungYoon and the rest of his companions also wanted to be part of the same team as YuWon.The group looked silently at him, waiting for a response to SungYoon\u2019s offer.\u2018He\u2019s definitely different from Kim MyungHoon,\u2019 thought YuWon.He had heard a similar offer from MyungHoon, but their offer was as different as night and day. MyungHoon had no intentions of forming a real \u2018team\u2019 with YuWon. He only wanted someone that would protect him and make his life easier.But these guys were different. They didn\u2019t want someone that would protect them, but someone that they could fight alongside as comrades.\u2018I recognize Elador. Is that girl Yolche? These guys all have pretty strong mental fortitudes.\u2019YuWon looked at them like an adult looking at children that were growing up big and strong.\u2018So these are the guys that Hargaan gathered? Not bad.\u2019In his early stages of the Tower, Elador and Paladinte climbed the Tower together with Hargaan. Around the midpoint, for a reason unbeknownst to YuWon, they split up, but he knew that they were still on good terms. Because when\u00a0that\u00a0event happened, Elador and Paladinte still sided with Hargaan.\u2018It\u2019s a pretty big team, and they all have potential. Yolche is ranked even higher than Elador and her brother. Seeing as how they managed to get here, they\u2019re definitely the big fish in this Tutorial\u2026\u2019Seeing as how Paladinte wasn\u2019t with them, YuWon decided that Hargaan probably split up the team for now to hunt more efficiently.YuWon was appreciative of the offer, but his mind was already made up.\u201cI\u2019ll have to say no.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I knew it.\u201dSungYoon slowly shook his head, having expected this response. YuWon was already powerful enough that he didn\u2019t need a team, and Hargaan mentioned how YuWon had already rejected his offer before. So why would YuWon say yes to his offer?While SungYoon was contemplating by himself, Yolche approached YuWon and asked, \u201cDoes that mean you\u2019re planning on fighting the boss alone?\u201dThe \u2018boss\u2019 she was speaking about wasn\u2019t something like the giant centipede that was lying dead on the floor here. She was talking about the final boss that lived at the top of the Tutorial Island, Barrag\u00e1nda.Yolche continued speaking, \u201cWe were given a month to clear this Tutorial. And we\u2019re allowed to fight the boss by combining our strengths instead of fighting it alone.\u201dYuWon nodded his head, before asking, \u201cSo what\u2019s your point?\u201d\u201cThe focus of the final Tutorial is \u2018teams.\u2019 It\u2019s a matter of how much you can grow within the given timeframe, how many comrades you can gather, and how well you can work together with them.\u201dShe was right. That was the design behind his final Tutorial: a boss that was impossible for a single person to defeat, a month to grow stronger, and no restrictions on the method. It was a stage where a \u2018team\u2019 was supposed to defeat a boss that no individual could defeat on their own. It was probably designed to teach the most basic method of climbing this tall Tower. However\u2026Crash\u2014!Rumble\u2014A loud noise erupted. Thunder boomed, and the ground shook lightly.Something, no, someone was headed over here.\u201cI contacted the captain.\u201dIt was Elador\u2019s doing.\u201cI told him that we found Kim YuWon, and he said he\u2019d be here right away\u2026\u201dSungYoon was baffled by Elador\u2019s words. He had traversed such a distance in a moment.\u201cIt\u2019s going to get pretty rowdy,\u201d predicted SungYoon.It was the guy that he\u2019d been looking for all this time. There was no way the hot-headed Hargaan would simply remain still. Their meeting would not be peaceful.And right on cue\u2026Flash\u2014Rumble\u2014A string of golden lightning passed by SungYoon. He was startled for a second by the light shock.\u201cKIM YUWON!\u201dBoom\u2014!Hargaan jumped up high, flying straight at YuWon.\u201cI finally caught you\u2026.!\u201dIn that moment\u2026Fwoosh\u2014Hargaan\u2019s vision went dark, and suddenly he was flying backwards.\u2018Huh?\u2019 thought Hargaan, wondering what was going on. But his train of thought was shortly interrupted by a hard impact to the head.Thump\u2014!Hargaan landed deep inside the shell of the giant centipede. What had happened was that YuWon had grabbed Hargaan\u2019s head, used his momentum against him, and threw him downwards.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dEverything had happened in a flash, and SungYoon and the rest of the gang were speechless.YuWon acted like nothing happened and looked down at Yolche, asking, \u201cDo you guys simply desire \u2018survival\u2019? Or do you guys want to become Rankers?\u201dYolche\u2019s eyes widened. He mentioned Rankers. She wondered how YuWon, who wasn\u2019t a Pure-Blood, knew about their existence.People who prevailed through all the trials of the Tower and cleared all the floors, those people were Rankers. With fame, authority, and the power of eternal life, every player desired to become a Ranker so they could possess any mystical item that existed within the Tower.\u201cBecause if that\u2019s all you guys want, you can play house elsewhere. I don\u2019t have any intention of playing along with such childish dreams.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you\u2019re different?\u201d asked Yolche.She no longer viewed YuWon as simply another Tutorial participant. She believed that he must have been a Pure-Blood like her. That his name was similar to Lee SungYoon must only have been a coincidence, and he was in fact a completely different being.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not that different. I have to become a Ranker one day as well. However, that\u2019s only part of the process. It\u2019s not my goal.\u201dThey were definitely a good team. Elador alone was destined to become a great, famed Ranker in the Tower. It was the same for Hargaan. However, YuWon couldn\u2019t go with them.What YuWon wanted wasn\u2019t simply to become stronger and make it through alive.\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of forming a team with people who have a different destination than me. That\u2019s my answer.\u201dYolche was baffled by YuWon\u2019s answer. In the Tower, just wishing to become a Ranker was enough to become a laughingstock, getting ridiculed for having such an unrealistic dream.However, YuWon was the complete opposite, saying that it wasn\u2019t great enough of a dream.\u201cAre you saying you\u2019ll become a High Ranker?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo. Even higher,\u201d YuWon answered, pointing up with his finger. \u201cI\u2026\u201dA place far higher than a Ranker. The final destination that YuWon was aiming for in this life wasn\u2019t something like a Ranker, a High Ranker, or the top of the Tower.\u201c\u2026 Am going to break through the ceiling of this Tower.\u201d____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 24Chapter 24Yolche remained silent for a while. Breaking through the ceiling of the Tower? It was something she had never even imagined.For someone like her who had remained in the middle floors for the longest time due to not being selected by the Tower, something like becoming a Ranker was nothing more than a dream.The king that led her people was a Ranker that she greatly admired. But to YuWon, her dream was merely a process.\u201cWhat kind of nonsense is\u2014?!\u201d\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?!\u201dYolche was interrupted by Hargaan, who YuWon had buried in the Parasite Dragon.Hargaan got up, growling like an animal and glaring at YuWon. He was baring his fangs, but he held himself back from attacking YuWon.Seeing Hargaan\u2019s response, YuWon shrugged his shoulders as he said, \u201cYou were coming at me so ferociously, I thought you were attacking me.\u201d\u201cI was only trying to catch you.\u201dAt the start of the 5th Tutorial, Hargaan had failed to catch YuWon. That event must have left a lasting impression on him, but YuWon didn\u2019t care about his feelings.\u201cAnyone would get scared when you jump at them like that.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dAfter hearing YuWon\u2019s response, Hargaan scratched his head and nodded in agreement.\u201cI guess that\u2019s true. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dIt was a surprisingly lukewarm response. YuWon had expected Hargaan to react more furiously.Then Hargaan smiled widely and reached out his hand.\u201cSetting that aside, you should join our team.\u201dThis was an offer Hargaan was making to the guy that just pummeled his head into a monster. YuWon wondered if he had no pride. He felt annoyed, wondering if he should repeat himself.\u201cThat guy can tell you\u2026\u201d\u201cI know. I heard.\u201d\u201cYou heard?\u201d\u201cI think you said something really fascinating. \u2018To break through the ceiling.\u2019 The idea is absolutely electrifying.\u201dVzzt, crackle\u2014Electricity started emitting from Hagaan\u2019s body. It was a sign that he was extremely excited. Also, Hargaan was pretty tough. He looked fine despite having taken a hard impact to the head.\u201cI heard it from my father before. That there is a greater power\u00a0outside\u00a0of the Tower.\u201d\u201cFrom your father?\u201d\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know who he is, but he\u2019s an incredibly important person,\u201d Hargaan said with a smug look on his face.It was apparent that he was immensely proud of his father, which wasn\u2019t all that surprising, because his father was Zeus, the king of Olympus, and one of the highest Rankers. With power that rivaled an Administrator, he was one of the few beings capable of controlling the humongous Tower.\u201cThat\u2019s right. A sardine can\u2019t swim with a whale, but don\u2019t think of me as just a little fish. One day, I\u2019m going to become the king of Olympus.\u201dThe person surprised by the grand declaration wasn\u2019t YuWon, but Yolche. She, like YuWon, knew the gravity the name \u201cOlympus\u201d carried. It was a faction comprised of numerous Rankers and High Rankers. They were godlike beings that ruled over multiple floors in the Tower. And Hargaan was here and now claiming he\u2019d become their king.\u201cYou got some pretty big aspirations,\u201d YuWon said, smirking.However, the smile on YuWon\u2019s face didn\u2019t last long. He thought, \u2018Becoming the king\u2026 is that why\u2026?\u2019YuWon observed Hargaan, who was beaming with confidence. It didn\u2019t appear like he was joking. According to\u00a0that\u00a0event that YuWon remembered, Hargaan had the potential to be a pretty big wildcard.\u2018A direct descendant of Olympus\u2026\u2019YuWon knew that changing his plans wasn\u2019t necessarily a great idea, but he also thought, \u2018The future has to change.\u2019Hargaan could be a pretty useful ace up his sleeve.\u2018What should I do\u2026\u2019While YuWon was lost in thought, Hargaan said, \u201cIf you really don\u2019t believe me, why don\u2019t I prove myself?\u201dYuWon responded with skepticism, \u201cProve what?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s make a bet. See who can defeat the boss first and who racks up more CP. You\u2019re welcome to form your own team with as many people as you want.\u201d\u201cWhat about you guys?\u201d\u201cOur team has nine people in total, and we won\u2019t be recruiting any more people.\u201dIt was a very appealing offer. YuWon was allowed to defeat the boss with a team of dozens or even hundreds of people, but they would try to do the same with only a nine-member team.\u201cHowever, if I win, you need to join our team.\u201dThis certainly piqued YuWon\u2019s interest. YuWon decided to take this opportunity and asked with a smug look on his face, \u201cAnd if I win?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll serve you as my hyung-nim.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not necessary. I don\u2019t need a li\u2019l brother like you.\u201dAfter taking a moment to think, YuWon nodded his head.\u201cInstead, if I win, help me just once when I need it.\u201d\u201cJust once?\u201d\u201cYou have a problem with that?\u201d\u201cNo. I was just wondering if that\u2019s actually enough, but alright. I accept. As long as it\u2019s not too ridiculous of a request, I\u2019ll do anything. If you want, I\u2019ll even give you my items.\u201dHargaan was beaming with confidence. He seemed pretty certain that he would win no matter what.YuWon nodded his head in approval hearing him say \u2018items.\u2019\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound all that bad.\u201dAs an Olympus Pure-Blood, Hargaan was sure to have some amazing items. And once he completed the Tutorial and entered the Tower, his influence would grow far stronger, so his assistance would be immensely helpful.\u201cSo do we have a bet?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAwesome. Hehehe.\u201dBam\u2014Hargaan couldn\u2019t stop laughing in excitement as he smashed his fists together. He seemed completely unphased by the fact that YuWon had hit him in the head just moments ago.\u201cI\u2019ll be seeing you on the 1st Floor, so prepare yourself,\u201d Hargaan told YuWon as he turned around and walked back to his group.Watching Hargaan walk away, YuWon scratched his head, having gotten an idea of how tough Hargaan actually was.\u2018No wonder he was able to finish the Tutorial in 10 days.\u2019Hargaan was as straight as an arrow. In about a week from now, with his current team, he\u2019d obtain enough power to defeat the boss.\u201cAlright now. You all heard that, right? Let\u2019s get a move on. We\u2019re on a tight schedule,\u201d Hargaan said to his teammates, corralling them out of the boss room.After checking the time, YuWon shouted to Hargaan and his team, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hurry so much.\u201dHargaan turned around in confusion. What did YuWon mean by \u201cthere was no need to hurry\u201d when they\u2019d just made a bet?YuWon shrugged his shoulders, explaining, \u201cCheck the time.\u201d\u201cThe time\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy does he want us to\u2026 Huh?\u201dHargaan and his teammates were all shocked after checking the time limit for the Tutorial.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d[TIME LIMIT : 632 : 07 : 46][TIME LIMIT : 632 : 07 : 46][TIME LIMIT : 632 : 07 : 46][\u2026\u2026]The time wasn\u2019t ticking down.None of them saw this coming, including Hargaan, who thought he had the most information as an Olympus Pure-Blood.What was going on?YuWon, reading Hargaan\u2019s face, answered the question on his mind.\u201cBarrag\u00e1nda isn\u2019t an island.\u201dThe Tutorial wasn\u2019t taking place on an artificially created island.\u201cIt\u2019s a mythical beast.\u201dThe Tutorial was happening on the back of a giant beast as large as a small country.Hearing YuWon\u2019s response made Hargaan take another look at all the corpses of the centipede-like monsters littering the ground.A thought came to Hargaan\u2019s mind. \u201cDoes that mean that they are\u2026\u201d\u201cParasites. They made a home inside this giant creature, and they were tormenting it by slowly sapping away its strength. Barrag\u00e1nda couldn\u2019t stand them anymore, which is why it decided to submerge itself, since the seawater would drown the parasites.\u201d\u201cSo was this giant monster the king of these parasites?\u201d\u201cSomething like that. It was the one giving birth and raising more parasites.\u201dHargaan wasn\u2019t sure whether or not he should believe what YuWon was saying. It was something that not even Olympus knew about, so how did a mysterious Tutorial participant know about all this?\u201cSo now\u2026\u201dYuWon smirked and nodded his head.\u201cThe time limit is obsolete.\u201d\u201cThe 5th Tutorial is a fight against time. It\u2019s a matter of defeating the boss with as much time remaining as possible.\u201cSo how did I defeat the boss within a week? I\u2019m only going to say this because of the circumstances, but it actually wasn\u2019t a week.\u201cBarrag\u00e1nda is actually\u2026\u201dThis was the secret to how Odin was able to defeat the 5th Tutorial\u2019s boss in under a week. It was all thanks to this hidden piece.\u201cIf enough time passes by, the Administrator or a Lackey will probably intervene, since they wouldn\u2019t want the Tutorial to last forever.\u201dHaving taken a long enough break, YuWon got back up.\u201cThat\u2019s when I\u2019ll finish this Tutorial.\u201dThe time limit stopped counting down.One by one, the participants of the Tutorial started noticing.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this? Is this an error?\u201d\u201cIt isn\u2019t just me, right?\u201d\u201cThe time\u2019s not going to just suddenly decrease all of a sudden, will it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll probably start working again soon.\u201dThe participants went back to hunting. Within the time limit, they had to level up and gain as much CP as possible.The participants of the 5th Tutorial were the Tower\u2019s players-in-training, having made it through an extremely slim survival rate. They were thinking about the future as they learned how to grow stronger.Meanwhile\u2026* * *> \u201cHe killed the Parasite Dragon\u2026 No one\u2019s managed to do this since Odin.\u201d> \u201cWhat about the Administrator? Has he received the news yet?\u201d> \u201cHe recently got into a confrontation with Olympus. He\u2019s currently very busy because of that.\u201dThe Lackeys wanted to kill themselves. The mechanism they had prepared for the Tutorial was defeated. Because of that, the Tutorial was in a state of \u2018error,\u2019 but there was no way to solve it right now.> \u201cSomeone, please contact the Administrator!\u201d> \u201cThat wasn\u2019t in a place where it could be easily discovered\u2026\u201d> \u201cDamn it. This hasn\u2019t happened since Odin.\u201dThe Lackeys were in utter chaos. They were trying their best to correct the course of the Tutorial, but because of the Administrator\u2019s absence, that didn\u2019t seem to be possible any time soon.And just like that, the time limit remained frozen.* * *Thud\u2014Flap, flap, flap\u2014A loud noise shook the forest, and a flock of birds flew up into the sky to escape from the heat that had engulfed the area.A large Orc fell to the ground.\u201cGurruk\u2014\u201d\u201cTchwik, chief!\u201d\u201cTchwik, human! Tchweek!\u201d\u201cTchwik, he\u2019s\u2014tchwik\u2014a monster!\u201dA horde of Red Orcs slowly walked backwards, trying to retreat.They were in fear.In the center of the burning forest, a giant, four-meter-tall Orc laid dead. And on top of that Orc stood a man.\u201cWho are you guys calling a monster?\u201dSshlk\u2014YuWon pulled out his sword from the Orc Chief\u2019s head and looked towards the horde.\u201cTchwik! Danger! Tchwik! Run away!\u201d\u201cTchweek!\u201dThe few surviving Orcs started running away in a hurry.\u201cDamn.\u201dYuWon sounded his disapproval in the middle of the chaos. Normally, he would have gone after the Orcs, but now wasn\u2019t the time for that.[TIME LIMIT : 632 : 01 : 12][TIME LIMIT : 632 : 01 : 11][TIME LIMIT : 632 : 01 : 10][\u2026\u2026]While he was hunting the Red Orc Chief, the time limit had started counting down again.It appeared that the Lackeys had managed to fix the broken ecosystem of the Tutorial, and this time, it would probably take more than just hunting the Parasite Dragon.\u2018There\u2019s no way they would just place the same broken mechanism back in.\u2019So once again, it was another race against time.\u2018I managed to earn myself about four days.\u2019It was actually more time than he had originally expected, which ended up being plenty of time.\u201cNow\u2026\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euYuWon started heading towards the top of the island.\u201c\u2026 I think it\u2019s about time I made my way.\u201dTo the Tower where Gods lived.____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 25Chapter 25At the top of Barrag\u00e1nda, there was a deep crater.This was a trial where you had to defeat the boss within a month and earn CP. And every skilled participant wanted to be the one to defeat it.\u201cQuite a few people are starting to show up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s inevitable. They know that if they get left behind here, they\u2019ll lose their chance to get ahead.\u201d\u201cThat team doesn\u2019t look half bad.\u201d\u201cThey just have a lot of people. They\u2019re basically scarecrows.\u201dYolche, SungYoon, and Elador looked at the participants that started gathering around the crater.They had split off from Hargaan after the bet was made so they could hunt more efficiently, trying to achieve as high a level as possible before hunting the boss.\u201cMost of them gotta be at least level 20,\u201d said SungYoon. He had the highest mana sensitivity in the party. With his high Arcane Power, he sensed the participants around them and mumbled, \u201cA few of them seem pretty strong.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re guys that made it this far. In order to enter the Tower, that\u2019s a minimum requirement.\u201d\u201cAre all the players inside the Tower able to control mana?\u201d\u201cPlayers can. Most people who aren\u2019t able to are residents of the Tower.\u201d\u201cResidents?\u201d\u201cThey are people who were born inside the Tower, like me and the captain. And they become a \u2018Pure-Blood\u2019 once they are selected by the Tower and receive the system\u2019s blessing.\u2019\u201cI see.\u201dSungYoon nodded his head like he understood.Dozens of people were forming groups to try and defeat the boss, but SungYoon had no expectations of any of them. He couldn\u2019t believe participants of their weak skills were attempting to fight the boss. From what he had heard, the Tutorial\u2019s boss was a creature that could never be defeated by the likes of them.\u201cHey, noona.* Do you think that we\u2019ll be able to defeat the boss?\u201d*TL/N: \u2018Noona\u2019 is a Korean honorific used by guys to refer to girls older than them.Yolche was a Pure-Blood just like Hargaan. And thanks to her experience as a mercenary, she had met many players who had taught her a lot about the Tutorial.Yolche took a second to think about SungYoon\u2019s question before shaking her head.\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201cAre you saying it\u2019s 50-50?\u201d\u201cYeah. Under normal circumstances, I\u2019d tell you that it\u2019s impossible, but\u2026\u201d Yolche trailed off while speaking to look far down the trail before she continued, \u201cI can\u2019t get a proper grasp of how powerful our captain is.\u201dThere was a group of five people walking up the mountain. That pack was led by Hargaan, who stuck out with his golden blonde hair.\u201cThey got here a bit late.\u201d\u201cEvery minute was valuable time. I\u2019m sure they wanted to make the most of it.\u201d\u201cI wonder what YuWon\u2019s doing right now?\u201d\u201cWho knows. Right now, he\u2019s probably\u2014\u201dElador, who was watching the crowd, answered SungYoon\u2019s question. \u201cHere he comes.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dSungYoon turned his head to look at the trail in the opposite direction, where he saw\u2026\u201cAlready\u2026?!\u201d\u2026 YuWon walking up the mountain.* * *\u201cIt\u2019s Hargaan!\u201d\u201cThat crazy bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cSo he finally showed up.\u201dHargaan\u2019s presence rowdied up the participants that were searching for a team. Among them were guys that Hargaan had sent flying on the first day.Hearing the commotion near the entrance to the boss room made YuWon laugh. It reminded him of the first time he met Hargaan.\u2018What a celebrity.\u2019A few familiar faces were present in the crowd next to the boss\u2019s crater. Yolche, Lee SungYoon, Elador, and other members of Hargaan\u2019s team. It appeared that they had continued hunting in two separate groups.\u2018They seem to have leveled up quite a bit.\u2019YuWon could sense that Elador and SungYoon\u2019s mana flow had changed. They must have leveled up multiple times because the flow of mana that they radiated now was much denser.They all had changed in just a few days, and Hargaan, their leader, was no exception.Crackle\u2014At the top of the mountain, Hargaan also spotted YuWon and started giving him a look.YuWon felt a light electric current.Hargaan grinned widely, waving at YuWon.\u201cYou\u2019re finally here.\u201dIt seemed that Hargaan already thought he had this in the bag as he warmly greeted YuWon as if he was an old friend.Hargaan walked up to YuWon and started looking around at the nearby participants in confusion.\u201cWhy is no one else with you? Have you not found a team yet?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a team.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have a team?\u201dYuWon nodded his head.\u201cI\u2019m all by myself.\u201dHargaan was baffled by YuWon\u2019s ridiculous response.\u201cAre you planning on defeating the boss by yourself?\u201d\u201cI mean, that\u2019s how I can get the most points.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been told that I was crazy many times in my life, but you\u2019re on a whole \u2019nother level.\u201dHargaan was overcome with greed while looking at YuWon. During the past four days while the time limit was frozen, he had tried his best to catch up to YuWon. However, the gap between the two had only widened.[1st \u2013 Kim YuWon : 28973cp][2nd \u2013 Hargaan : 21410cp]A CP difference of over 7,000.In order to flip the scoreboard, the only option Hargaan had was to earn more CP in the process of defeating the boss. All in order to recruit YuWon into his team and to finish the Tutorial in first place.Hargaan was determined to raid the boss before YuWon no matter what.\u201cCould that be him?\u201d\u201cYou mean Kim YuWon?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s ranked even higher than Hargaan.\u201d\u201cHow strong is he?\u201d\u201cIs this guy also a Pure-Blood or whatever?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I\u2019ve never heard his name before\u2026\u201dThe people around them murmured, eavesdropping on YuWon and Hargaan\u2019s conversation. A few of the Pure-Blood participants even started giving each other looks to see if anyone recognized YuWon.Soon after\u2026\u201cFrom what I heard, it seems like you don\u2019t have a team\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re actually about to start our raid.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a team, would you like to join us?\u201dA few participants started approaching YuWon. They were reckless and daring, making an attempt at defeating the boss. But none of them appeared to be adequately skilled.\u201cHow dare you fucking weak-ass fruitflies try and\u2014\u201dVzzt, crackle\u2014At the thought of YuWon joining a different team, Hargaan started emitting electricity out of fury. He was okay with YuWon forming his own team, but his pride couldn\u2019t stand to see him join someone else\u2019s team.\u201cD-Dodge!\u201d\u201cHe was Hargaan\u2019s teammate!\u201d\u201cI-I promise that I was only just standing here. Really!\u201dThe participants, having already faced his wrath a few times, immediately backed off from YuWon.Thanks to Hargaan clearing away the pests for him, YuWon started making way.Fizzle\u2014As YuWon walked away from him, Hargaan stopped gathering electricity in the palm of his hand. After realizing that YuWon was headed towards the boss\u2019s crater, he asked, \u201cAre you going for it right away?\u201d\u201cWell, time inside the Tutorial is more valuable than gold.\u201dYuWon was right. Hargaan nodded his head in agreement and started walking right beside YuWon. Then Elador and her brother, as well as the rest of his team, started following Hargaan.\u201cTo try and clear the Tutorial in five days. This is very exciting.\u201dAfter seeing YuWon and Hargaan make a move, the other participants also started following them. It was quite obvious what they were thinking. They wanted to forcibly become a part of the boss raid and earn some CP.\u201cThese motherfuckers\u2026\u201dWhile walking towards the crater, Hargaan looked back and shot them a glare.Vzzt, crackle\u2014Between his glare and the golden electricity he was emitting, the other participants took a step back, unable to come any closer.YuWon had been worried about getting pestered by the small fry, so he was thankful for Hargaan.Tmp, tmp\u2014YuWon was finally right in front of the crater.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dAnd as soon as he took a step into it\u2026Fwoosh\u2014!\u2026 His body was sucked into the deep crater.[You\u2019ve entered Boss Room No.1.][Please find the boss and clear the trial.]A large, deep cave sprawled out in front of YuWon\u2019s eyes. This place was similar to the underground dungeon where he killed the Parasite Dragon.This was the Boss Room. In order to meet the true boss, there were a few hurdles he had to get past first.\u201cHissss\u2014!\u201dSlither, ssk\u2014!Kling, klang\u2014Various monsters appeared out of the cave.\u2018Acid Snakes, Land Eels, Lizardmen, Orc Warriors, and Goblin Warriors.\u2019Armed Orcs and Goblins, Acid Snakes and Lizardmen. Hostile monsters that couldn\u2019t cohabitate together were all staring down at YuWon. This was something that normally would have been impossible, but on this island it wasn\u2019t.\u2018That guy is easily capable of this kind of control.\u2019There were at least a few hundred monsters just within his sight. This was a scale that should have been impossible for any one man to handle because it was never intended for anyone to attempt alone.Klack\u2014The Goblin Warriors and Orc Warriors raised their shields, strengthening their defensive formation.Klack\u2014The Lizardmen poked out their swords and spears through the openings between the shields. These monsters were like a well-trained army.\u201cHisssss\u2014!\u201dOn the floor, a long, thin snake slithered around.\u201cWow. What\u2019s all this?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a ton of them.\u201dHargaan and his companions that came in after YuWon looked at the monsters blocking their path with fascination.They didn\u2019t look all that worried because, to them, an army of monsters of this caliber wasn\u2019t much of an obstacle. Every single one of them were the dark horses of this Tutorial.\u2018The boss is in room number three,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.Tmp, tmp\u2014YuWon started walking towards the monsters\u2019 shield formation, thinking, \u2018I need to break through as fast as possible.\u2019Finally getting the opportunity to see YuWon\u2019s skills, Hargaan\u2019s companions stood by and observed him, despite all the CP that was laid out before them.\u2018Do we finally get to see him in action?\u2019\u2018I wonder how strong he is?\u2019\u2018The captain is already a monster\u2026 Yet he\u2019s ranked even higher than the captain.\u2019\u2018I wonder if he only has a lot of CP, or maybe he is actually that powerful?\u2019\u2018I can finally verify it with my own eyes.\u2019Even Hargaan, who was always the first to charge into battle, crossed his arms and watched YuWon go forth, as if signaling YuWon to go and do his thing.And as if trying to meet their expectations\u2026[Colossal Fire x Arcane Sword]Whirr, whirr\u2014Fwoosh\u2014A crimson mana pulsated from YuWon\u2019s sword. Extreme heat and a razor-sharp aura enveloped him. It was the result of combining two of his skills.He continued to walk closer and closer to the monsters.Tmp\u2014 Tmp\u2014There was a heavy tension in the air. He looked like he was taking slow steps, but the gap between YuWon and the monsters closed quickly.It had only been a few seconds. After taking a few steps, in a flash\u2026Whoosh\u2014\u2018He disappeared?\u2019\u2018Where did he go?\u2019The gang lost sight of YuWon. The only one who managed to follow YuWon\u2019s movements was Hargaan.After disappearing\u2026Wham\u2014!YuWon landed on top of the monsters\u2019 heads.Fwoosh\u2014!The crimson Arcane Sword started flying between the Orcs, Goblins, and Lizardmen. The monsters cried out in pain as a crimson storm brewed around them.The fiery heat burned their flesh, and every time the sword flashed, multiple heads dropped.And in just a few seconds\u2026Thud\u2014 Thump\u2014A pathway was created between the Orcs and Goblins that were blocking the way.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026 What in the world?\u201d SungYoon mumbled in shock.In an instant, YuWon had penetrated the monsters\u2019 defenses and committed a slaughter with just a single sword.\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 even more of a monster than the captain.\u201d____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Chapter 26Mumbling to himself, SungYoon looked to the side in fear. Luckily, Hargaan didn\u2019t seem to mind SungYoon\u2019s comment about him. Instead, he was smiling with extreme excitement.\u201cI knew it.\u201dVzzt\u2014Electricity started gathering around Hargaan\u2019s fists. He could no longer just stand by and watch.Boom\u2014!The electricity in his fists let out an explosive sound, and Hargaan took a step forward. Then, just like YuWon, Hargaan disappeared in an instant.Instantly\u2026Flash\u2014Crash\u2014 Smash\u2014!The Orcs\u2019 shields broke into pieces, and the Acid Snakes that littered the floor were torn to shreds.It was the power of Hargaan\u2019s electric attacks.\u201cLike\u2026 we aren\u2019t even needed, are we?\u201d\u201cYeah, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should just stand around and watch.\u201dIf you don\u2019t do anything, you fall behind. That was the unchanging rule of the new world that they\u2019d experienced since the 1st Tutorial.SungYoon started charging up his Mana Blast. Yolche unsheathed her dual swords, and the Elf siblings prepped their spirits and magic respectively.The real hunt had started.* * *Boss room No.2 was a path filled with various traps\u2014dozens of powerful arrows were fired at them while poison rained down, and swords and spears shot up from the ground.However\u2026Crash\u2014!Hargaan managed to break through all those traps with sheer force.It was the same for YuWon.Fshh, fwooosh\u2014Sizzle\u2014The fire that enveloped YuWon\u2019s body burned away the arrows and poison that flew at him, and the weapons shooting up were easily avoided with some acrobatics.\u201cThere really isn\u2019t anything for us to do, huh.\u201d\u201cIt appears so.\u201dHargaan\u2019s teammates passed through the pathway the two of them had created. There were some traps that weren\u2019t destroyed, but they weren\u2019t so weak as to get caught in them.Slash, shing\u2014With her sword, Yolche cut down the flying arrows and spears.Fsssh\u2014Elador and Paladinte stopped the poison that was raining down with fire and water.[Mana Blast]Boom\u2014!Any large obstacles that blocked their path were instantly blown up by SungYoon.YuWon glanced back at the guys following behind him and nodded his head.\u2018At least they\u2019re skilled enough to not be a hindrance.\u2019With the exception of Hargaan, YuWon had actually doubted their skills. He was worried they might have ended up holding him back.Well, that wasn\u2019t exactly right, since YuWon had no intention of helping any of them, even if their lives were in peril. He didn\u2019t have the luxury to intervene and help out every person he passed by.What YuWon was actually worried about was that they might accidentally get caught up in his business and die.\u201cI think it\u2019s that way.\u201dWith an impatient personality, Hargaan was the one furthest ahead.After clearing through all the traps, a large door could be seen in the distance. It was an old door that looked to be at least 10 meters tall.After arriving in front of it, Hargaan waited for YuWon and his party.\u201c\u2026 What a strange painting.\u201dHargaan looked at the paintings on the giant door. There were many different drawings all over it. Orcs, Goblins, Lizardmen, Kobolds, Gnolls, Ogres\u2026 Countless monsters were depicted. And at the top of the door, puzzling hieroglyphics were inscribed.\u2018This is my first time seeing it in person.\u2019Sshhf\u2014YuWon wiped off the dust on the door.In the center of the painting where Orcs and Goblins were clashing was a drawing of a round object.\u201cIt\u2019s a war,\u201d Hargaan mumbled, understanding what the painting meant.YuWon nodded his head. Hargaan was right. It was a humongous war that once occurred between various monsters on Barrag\u00e1nda.\u2018And beyond this door\u2026\u2019\u201cCaptain,\u201d SungYoon called.Hargaan turned around and saw that his teammates had all managed to catch up to him.SungYoon said, \u201cHow about we take a short break?\u201dHargaan looked over at YuWon. Though they were accompanying each other due to sharing a destination, YuWon wasn\u2019t actually a part of Hargaan\u2019s team. Not to mention the fact that he and Hargaan had a bet to see who could defeat the boss first.\u201cIs anyone exhausted?\u201d asked Hargaan. He was in a hurry, so of course he didn\u2019t like the idea of letting YuWon go through the door first.\u201cThere is not, sir.\u201d\u201cThere wasn\u2019t anything all that impressive.\u201d\u201cPaladinte, that\u2019s because YuWon and the captain had already broken through most of the traps.\u201dThere wasn\u2019t anyone in Hargaan\u2019s team that appeared injured or exhausted.Hargaan nodded his head. It seemed like they were ready to enter.\u201cThen let\u2019s\u2014\u201dCreeeak\u2014With a thick, heavy sound, the cave rumbled.Hargaan turned his head and saw that YuWon was already opening the door.\u201cCome on, you\u2019re going to enter without saying a thing?\u201d\u201cI was planning on doing this by myself from the beginning.\u201d\u201cBut we\u2019re working together right now, aren\u2019t we?

He knew the boss\u2019s identity, but this was the first time he was facing it directly. \u201cHe really is an incredible bastard,\u201d he commented.Tmp\u2014YuWon was once again quick in his steps. The door had opened just enough for one person to get through, so he started walking inside the room.Hargaan couldn\u2019t continue hesitating, so he looked back at his group and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dTmp\u2014 tmp\u2014Unlike the rest of the cave where there were torches lining the wall, inside of the door was entirely dark.Hargaan gathered electricity in his hands to create some light. The inside of the room was a long cave, and towards the center, the ceiling got higher, forming a circular dome.And at the center of the dome was\u2026Thump\u2014\u201cKkyaaagh\u2014!\u201d\u2026 The source of the cries.\u201cW-What\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026?\u201dThump, thump\u2014!Rattle, rattle\u2014The boss was locked behind giant steel bars, and it had a terrifying appearance. It looked like a disgusting mix of Orc, Goblin, Ogre, and more\u2014the face resembling various monsters, the body of an Ogre, the legs of an Orc, the tail of a Lizardman, and black wings from an unknown beast.This monster towered over 10 meters tall.\u201cKkyaaagh\u2014!\u201dThe boss screamed at the group that had appeared within its sights.Just hearing its cry made their bodies feel like they were going numb.With the exception of YuWon and Hargaan, the rest of the gang took a few steps back, unable to withstand the pressure from the boss.YuWon observed the boss, which was restrained with chains all over its body.\u201cA Chimera.\u201dThe boss struggled in pain. It considered itself, a mix of various monsters, an abomination, feeling pain and anger. This mix of emotions condensed into bloodthirst and mana, which swirled around the Chimera.The Chimera in front of them was a monster that didn\u2019t naturally exist within the Tutorial, like Suruhtra. That\u2019s why it was the final boss of the Tutorial and why it required the cooperation of tens of thousands of participants to defeat it.[You\u2019ve entered Boss Room No.3.][DEFEAT THE BOSS \u2013 THE \u2018SEALED CHIMERA.\u2019][Once the objective is achieved, the Tutorial will be finalized.]Those were pretty simple messages, but there were more messages waiting for them in boss room No.3.[1 person is able to break the Chimera\u2019s seal and make it their familiar.][If you break the sealing crystal, the time limit will end, and you will be able to pass the Tutorial regardless of the requirements.][The Chimera\u2019s master will earn additional CP respective to the participants they kill.]Whirr\u2014Next to the cell where the Chimera was locked up, there was a staff glowing dark red. And at the top of the staff, there was a crystal emitting light. That was likely the 'sealing crystal\u201d that the message had mentioned.\u201cSo if that thing is broken, this guy is going to be freed from its jail?\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s a trial where you need to kill the Chimera while also defending the crystal from other participants\u2026\u201d\u201cThis doesn\u2019t seem that hard.\u201dThe trial would have been far more complicated if more participants were present, but only ten people were inside the boss room right now.It wasn\u2019t too big a number for keeping track of each other\u2019s movements. And even if one of them tried to pull something, there was the force called Hargaan that they had to get through first.Grab\u2014\u201cHey.\u201dYuWon turned his head. Before he realized it, Hargaan had snuck up behind him and grabbed his shoulder tightly.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d asked Hargaan.\u201cLet go.\u201d\u201cI asked what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\u201cI need that thing.\u201d\u201cAre you planning on betraying me after all that? Did you forget about our bet?\u201dThe bet between YuWon and Hargaan was either who could kill the boss first or rack up the most CP. That meant that in order for the bet to be resolved, one of them had to kill the boss.However, if the sealing crystal was broken, the participant who broke it would be able to control the Chimera like a familiar. Thus they would no longer be able to bet on who could kill the boss first.\u201cI didn\u2019t. I think I\u2019m going to be the winner of that bet,\u201d YuWon replied.After hearing YuWon\u2019s response, Hargaan froze for a second before shouting and squeezing YuWon\u2019s shoulder even tighter.\u201cThen what are you doing? Why do you need that thing?!\u201d\u201c\u2026 This is why I wanted to do this alone.\u201dYuWon let out a sigh while raising his hand.

The steel bars that held the giant beast started fading and quickly disintegrated.\u201cHow could you do this\u2026?!\u201d Hargaan shouted in anger, intensely glaring at YuWon, who had just broken the sealing crystal.YuWon had become the master of the Chimera.Hargaan felt like he was just betrayed by a trusted comrade. However, YuWon\u2019s next action was not what he had expected.\u201cChimera,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cGrrrrr\u2014\u201d\u201cBreak that wall,\u201d YuWon ordered.Having been released from its shackles, the Chimera ran towards the wall. When it collided with it, it shook the entire cave.Smash\u2014!Rumble\u2014!The wall crumbled, and another cave was unveiled.Surprised by YuWon\u2019s unexpected command, Hargaan asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you first let go of me, and then we can talk.\u201dGrab\u2014YuWon tried to push off Hargaan\u2019s hand.Squeeze\u2014However, Hargaan wouldn\u2019t let go of his shoulder.

YuWon had managed to get full control of it by destroying the sealing crystal. Now, it would only move on YuWon\u2019s orders. So as long as YuWon didn\u2019t intend on attacking the participants with it, there would be no problems.\u201cI have a different opponent to face.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a different opponent?\u201cThe Chimera is a monster created from the various monsters on this island.\u201d\u201cWhat does that have to do with\u2014?\u201d\u201cSo who created this Chimera?\u201dHargaan\u2019s eyes widened after hearing YuWon\u2019s question, and he eased his grip on his shoulder. He stared at the wall the Chimera broke down. If the Chimera was the true boss, and there was no additional stage, the other cave shouldn\u2019t have existed.\u2018No way\u2026\u2019 thought Hargaan.But there certainly was a way, and YuWon started walking to the newly opened space with the Chimera.It was an unexpected situation.\u201cCaptain.\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201dThe message clearly said to kill the Chimera. He was the Tutorial\u2019s boss, and they were participants that had to defeat the boss. However, the situation before them turned out to be not so black and white.\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s check it out first.\u201dHargaan and his team followed behind YuWon.Inside the broken wall, there was a long tunnel, and inside was\u2026\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\u201cAn arm?\u201d\u201c\u2026 A head?\u201d\u2026 What looked to be human body parts hanging all over the place.Thud, thud\u2014YuWon continued to make his way through the tunnel with his Chimera.The end of the tunnel appeared not long after.Fwoosh\u2014It led to a large cave lined with torches.This was the 5th Tutorial\u2019s boss room No.4, which the message had kept a secret.[You\u2019ve entered Boss Room No.4.][The boss has been updated.][DEFEAT THE BOSS \u2013 THE \u2018CHIMERA CREATOR.\u2019]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cA new boss?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a \u2018Chimera Creator\u2019?\u201d\u201cDamn it. What\u2019s going on?\u201dHargaan and his teammates were confused by the new messages that suddenly popped up.Even before getting selected by the Tower, Hargaan had been told over and over about the Tutorial, but even he had never heard of room No.4 or the existence of another boss.\u201cThis place is\u2026\u201d Hargaan said while looking around the room.This was a cave that was far bigger than the other boss rooms. And inside the cave, the floor was littered with corpses.\u201cAre you participants of the Tutorial?\u201d\u201cGrrrr\u2014\u201dYuWon\u2019s Chimera let out a cry mixed with anger.\u201cWere you taking a nap?\u201d YuWon asked while looking at the center of the cave.Step\u2014There was a long desk and a very skinny man working on something with blood-stained hands.\u201cChimera Creator,\u201d YuWon called out.\u201cWell, this is a first.\u201dCreak\u2014The man stood up from his chair. His face was as bony as his body. He must have not seen the sun in a long time. His skin was beyond pale, which starkly contrasted with his black robe.\u201cDespite having control over the Chimera, you didn\u2019t betray the other participants and instead came to my room.\u201d The man\u2019s raspy voice exuded an ominous feeling.Amused, he smiled while looking back and forth between YuWon and Hargaan.\u201cOho. So you\u2019re a descendant of Zeus. You might only be a halfbreed, but you should still be quite useful.\u201d\u201cWho are you calling a halfbreed?\u201dHargaan\u2019s forehead vein popped out.\u2018Halfbreed.\u2019 It was Hargaan\u2019s most hated word.Hargaan angrily asked, \u201cWho is this guy?\u201d\u201cThe dark magician Childe. He\u2019s a Ranker that disappeared from the Tower long ago.\u201d\u201cChilde?\u201dHargaan was taken aback. A Ranker\u2026 in the Tutorial? Setting aside the fact that a being that was once at the top of the Tower was somehow in the Tutorial, how were they supposed to beat a Ranker?\u201cIs this guy actually\u00a0the\u00a0Childe?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of him before. He\u2019s a Ranker that was the test examiner on the 50th floor. I heard how he captured hundreds of players for experiments and made a Chimera by mixing various monsters.\u201dHargaan\u2019s teammates froze up after hearing Hargaan\u2019s explanation. That was a pretty infamous incident in the Tower. A Ranker who wasn\u2019t able to control their desires and impulses ended up messing with countless test participants despite being a test examiner.\u201cDon\u2019t be such a wuss. He ended up losing to a player in a humiliating fashion, and due to breaking the rules of the Tower, he lost most of his powers.\u201d\u201cHe lost his powers?\u201d\u201cYeah. And due to that event, he\u2019s been forced to make the Tutorial\u2019s bosses for a thousand years. Though, even after a thousand years pass, he won\u2019t be able to regain his powers.\u201dThe smile on Childe\u2019s face slowly wore off as YuWon continued to talk. He didn\u2019t find it all that pleasing to hear someone else talk about his circumstances.\u201cYou. How do you know about me?\u201d Childe asked while staring closely at YuWon.Seeing as how he must have hit a nerve, YuWon smirked while pointing at his own eyes.\u201cDo you by chance remember these?\u201d\u201cAre you asking me to pull out your eyes? Why are you pointing at your\u2026\u201dChilde stopped talking after seeing his eyes. They had turned red. It was the [Cinder Eyes.]When he noticed them, Childe erupted into fury.\u201cYou scoundrel\u2014!\u201dFwoooosh\u2014!Childe\u2019s voice echoed as jet-black mana started circling around him.YuWon reached out his hand in front of him to protect himself from the mana with [Colossal Fire.]\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat kind of mana is this\u2026?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say he lost his powers?\u201dVzzzzt\u2014Hargaan shot out an electric field, nullifying the black mana.\u201cThis is him without his powers,\u201d YuWon said.Hargan grumbled, fighting against the black mana that Childe was exuding.\u201cIf he was a real Ranker, we\u2019d all be dead already,\u201d YuWon continued.Fwooosh, fwoosh\u2014YuWon protected himself by shrouding himself with fire.Able to feel Childe\u2019s anger through the mana, YuWon looked back at Childe to mock him.\u201cSo you still haven\u2019t forgotten.\u201d\u201cThose eyes. Those eyes! Where did you get them?!\u201d\u201cI got them inside the Tutorial.\u201d\u201cScoundrel, are you a kin of that Monkey?\u201dMonkey. There weren\u2019t many who could refer to \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal\u201d in that manner.Knowing the relationship between Childe and Son OhGong, YuWon continued to push his buttons.\u201cWhat are you so upset about? You\u2019re the one that captured and experimented on participants despite being a test examiner.\u201d\u201cAnswer my question!\u201d\u201cNo. I didn\u2019t come here just to satisfy your curiosity\u2026\u201dYuWon\u2019s eyes darted between the human-type Chimeras that filled the cave.\u201cI came here because I can\u2019t stand letting scumbags like you continue to live.\u201dThose words fully flipped Childe\u2019s switch.\u201cYou bastard\u2014!\u201dRumble, rumble\u2014The cave shook.The black mana flooded the floor, and the corpses that littered the cave started twitching. The corpses were covered in stitches with mismatched heads, eyes, arms, and legs glued together.\u201cFine, I don\u2019t need your answer. I at least know that you and that Monkey are related. I\u2019m going to make you talk, and after tearing you apart, I\u2019m going to turn you into a Chimera and present it to that fucking Monkey.\u201dThe Chimeras in the room reacted to the bloodthirst in Childe\u2019s voice. They were human-type Chimeras made from the body parts of Tutorial participants. And some of them emanated pretty dense mana.\u2018So it\u2019s these guys, huh,\u2019 YuWon thought.Approximately a hundred years later, a player that could control Chimeras would appear in the lower floors. The player\u2019s Chimeras, unlike normal Chimeras, grew stronger as they climbed the Tower, as if they had received the system\u2019s blessing.Chimeras that could level up. Those were the Chimeras that Childe was researching here.\u2018It seems that he was nearing completion, but\u2026\u2019Luckily, it seemed that he simply had a large number of them, and they weren\u2019t perfected yet.\u201cChimera.\u201d\u201cGrrrrr\u2014\u201dThe unsealed Chimera reacted to YuWon\u2019s words. It bared its fangs like it was ready to charge at any moment. It was probably furious at Childe for turning it into such an abomination.\u201cClear out all these mutts.\u201d\u201cKyaaagh\u2014!\u201dThud, stomp, stomp\u2014It was a fight between Chimeras.The giant unsealed Chimera stomped and tore apart the human-type Chimeras.\u201cFuck. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe just have to get rid of these things, right?\u201dHargaan\u2019s teammates started fighting against the monsters too.The human-type Chimeras were a bit too strong for the average Tutorial participant to handle. However, these guys were all high-ranking participants.Hargaan started shooting out electric attacks, slaughtering the Chimeras, which greatly helped the situation.YuWon\u2019s original plan was to have the unsealed Chimera keep the human-type Chimeras preoccupied while he fought against Childe, but thanks to Hargaan and his team, YuWon had one less concern.\u2018This should make things a bit easier.\u2019No longer needing to pay any attention to the enemy Chimeras, YuWon felt at ease while looking at Childe.Childe was pointing a staff made out of black wood at YuWon.Whirr\u2014The black mana around YuWon pulsated, and from the staff, a shining mana shot out.Whoosh\u2014![Dark Casket]Thunk\u2014A black casket appeared out of nowhere and swallowed YuWon whole.\u201cThat is an unbreakable casket. Even the sealed Chimera wouldn\u2019t be able to break out of it.\u201dHaving caught YuWon much more easily than he had predicted, Childe laughed, forgetting about his anger.\u201cI might have fallen and lost my power, but how dare a lowly Tutorial participant look down on me? I\u2019m going to turn you into a Chimera, and for eternity you\u2019ll be neither alive nor\u2014\u201dCrack\u2014The [Dark Casket] started to fracture.\u201c\u2014Dead\u2026?\u201dChilde questioned his own eyes. There was no way that a greenhorn that hadn\u2019t even earned the qualification of being a player was doing this.Thump\u2014!Kk-crack\u2014!\u201cH-How the\u2014?!\u201dBut it was happening.A shock reverberated inside, and this shock was breaking down the [Dark Casket.]Childe quickly imbued more mana through his staff, but he had reacted a little too late.Smash\u2014!Shatter\u2014The [Dark Casket,] an immobilization skill that Childe prided in, was destroyed by a mere Tutorial participant, of all people.Crack, snap\u2014Having smashed through the [Dark Casket] with his bare hands, YuWon walked out of the fragments clenching and unclenching his fist.\u201cThat arm\u2026\u201d Childe said in shock.YuWon\u2019s right arm had grown over 50% bigger. The veins looked like they were ready to pop, and YuWon\u2019s body had an irregular flow of mana.As a Ranker, Childe had once seen a skill like this from a distance. Although, YuWon\u2019s skill was almost pathetic in comparison\u2026Childe gave up on thinking in the midst of all the confusion.\u201cScoundrel, what is your relationship with Olympus?\u201dIn Childe\u2019s eyes, YuWon appeared quite similar to a certain Olympus Ranker.The key player in the Gigantomachy mythology. A son of Zeus, the main character of \u201cThe 12 Labors,\u201d and the holder of the title the \u201cGiant Slayer\u201d\u2026The great hero Hercules.[Gigantification]Right now, that hero\u2019s power was imbued in YuWon\u2019s arm.____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Chapter 28If YuWon had to pick a person that he respected the most, he\u2019d have picked Hercules.He was a hero. Hercules never hesitated to punish evil, and he had enough power to do so. He was kind to the weak, and he never abused his powers. In terms of strength, he was stronger than anyone else in the Tower. That was Hercules.\u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping for is \u2018Gigantification.\u2019\u201dThis was right before the war against the Outer Gods broke out. It was during the time when Chronos had told them about the possibility of the \u300cClock Movement,\u300d and they had started discussing who would be sent to the past.Son OhGong, Chronos, Hercules, Odin. Many of the greatest beings in the Tower had gathered in one place to debate on what to obtain and what to toss aside.\u201cNo. That\u2019s too inefficient.\u201dOdin had rejected Hercules\u2019s suggestion.[Gigantification] was certainly a good skill. Even if you searched all over the Tower, there were probably less than a hundred skills that could be considered better. However, obtaining it was far too complicated.\u201cBesides, that doesn\u2019t match up with our goals. You do know what killing 10,000 Giants and getting drenched in blood would mean, right?\u201d\u201cThe Gigantomachy isn\u2019t the only opportunity to fight a Giant.\u201dHercules looked over at Son OhGong, who was sleeping in the corner.That was when YuWon understood what Hercules was trying to say.\u201cSuruhtra.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou want to catch him?\u201d\u201cWere you only planning on running away from it until time ran out? Although I guess that would be much safer.\u201dHercules shrugged his shoulders.Hercules was among the candidates to return to the past. After hearing about Suruhtra, he thought he had found a potential key for [Gigantification.]It wasn\u2019t an unfounded idea. Giants were one of the ruling races of the Tower. So what would happen if one were to drench oneself in a Giant\u2019s blood during the Tutorial? It might have been possible to obtain [Gigantification] with just a single \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart.\u300d\u201cWe should kill it.\u201d\u201cThere isn\u2019t really an opportunity for it otherwise.\u201d\u201cI vote yes.\u201d\u201cI vote no. It\u2019s far too dangerous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026 abstain from the vote.\u201dThe vote ended. The result was \u201cyes.\u201dIt was all thanks to the final vote in favor by YuWon.\u201cI guess now we need to start thinking about how someone can defeat Suruhtra.\u201d\u201cThey will need points. If they can just get the Arctic Steel Sword\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be enough.

However, after activating [Gigantification,] the muscles in his arms became ripped like a Giant\u2019s.[Your arm has been imbued with the power of a Giant.][You have a low proficiency.][Your Constitution stat will temporarily change into Strength.][Your Constitution is too low.][Partial Gigantification will occur.]Only his right arm had been imbued with the power of a Giant. Due to a low proficiency and Constitution, YuWon couldn\u2019t properly utilize [Gigantification] yet.However, this was enough.\u2018I see. So this is my limit at this point.\u2019YuWon massaged his right arm while stretching.[Gigantification] was a skill that required more Constitution than Arcane Power. It worked by turning your Constitution into Strength so you could unleash explosive power.Luckily, YuWon had gained quite a bit of Strength and Constitution from eating Suruhtra\u2019s heart, but he was still far from being able to unleash the full power of [Gigantification.]\u2018Still\u2026\u2019Clench\u2014YuWon tightened his fist, feeling the power in his right arm.\u201cThis should suffice.\u201dThud\u2014YuWon\u2019s feet touched the ground.Feeling ignored, Childe\u2019s face once again turned sour.\u201cAlright, fine.\u201dWiggle, wiggle\u2014The black mana convulsed, turning into dozens of strands. Then Childe raised up his staff and arms while shouting, \u201cI\u2019ll hear your answer after I\u2019ve torn you to shreds. Even if you are a direct descendent of Olympus like that halfbreed, you\u2019re still just a li\u2019l runt!\u201dWoosh\u2014!All of the strands of mana flew towards YuWon.At the same time, YuWon stretched out his hands in front of him.Grasp\u2014Riiip, snap\u2014\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201dYuWon\u2019s grip tore apart the strands of mana, making them lose power and dissipate.Shocked, Childe imbued more mana into his staff.[Triple Dark Casket]Thunk\u2014Rattle, rattle\u2014Three [Dark Caskets] popped up from the ground, swallowing YuWon one after another. This was a much sturdier restraint. However\u2026Smash\u2014!\u2026 Nothing changed this time around. The [Dark Caskets] easily crumbled under YuWon\u2019s punch. But having expected that, Childe cast a follow-up skill.[Corrupted Venom Fang]Whirr\u2014Dozens of fangs appeared around YuWon and Childe. Each of them were tough enough to easily pierce steel, not to mention that they were poisonous.\u201cDon\u2019t die from this.\u201dChilde laughed with a twisted smile as he swung his staff.\u201cI have a lot I want to hear from you.\u201dWoosh, woosh, woosh\u2014!All the fangs flew towards YuWon.Fwoosh\u2014The red in YuWon\u2019s eye became more saturated.The fangs that were flying towards him all looked slow. YuWon didn\u2019t even attempt to dodge them.Smash\u2014!One of the fangs shattered into pieces, its fragments flying everywhere.One was okay. Childe had expected that, but\u2026Smash, smash\u2014!Seeing his fangs get broken one after another slowly wiped the smile off Childe\u2019s face.\u201cHow is this\u2026?\u201dSmash\u2014!At least half the fangs were destroyed.Childe sensed the flow of mana in YuWon\u2019s arm.[Gigantification] wasn\u2019t a skill that only raised one\u2019s strength. The skill basically turned one\u2019s body into a lethal weapon.\u2018Even if he is a descendant of Hercules, how can a participant of the Tutorial break these with sheer force?\u2019YuWon had gotten closer to Childe.To Childe, YuWon appeared like an angry bull, coming closer while demolishing dozens of fangs.Childe prepared his next skill.[Ebony Thornwall]Rumble\u2014A double-layered black wall appeared. This wall made up of hundreds of thorns was currently the strongest defensive skill that Childe could use after falling to the Tutorial area.\u2018Try and get through this. Before you can break through, your hand will\u2014\u2019Wham\u2014!Crack\u2014Having thought he was safe surrounded by the thornwall, Childe was shocked. He felt the impact from outside.A fracture appeared in the [Ebony Thornwall.]YuWon was unphased, continuing to attempt to break it down.\u201cCrazy son of a bitch!\u201dWhirr\u2014Childe imbued more mana into the [Ebony Thornwall.]Wham, wham\u2014!Rumble, rumble\u2014The wall continued to shake.Wham\u2014!Kk-crack\u2014The crack continued to grow larger.Sweat gathered on Childe\u2019s forehead as he continued to imbue mana into the wall.Wham\u2014!!That was the final blow.For a moment, YuWon\u2019s punches stopped.\u201cHaa\u2026 Haa\u2026\u201dChilde collected his breath, having become drenched in sweat from using so much mana.\u2018Did he stop?\u2019The impacts had stopped.Childe regained his smile slowly.\u2018Yeah. I bet he\u2019s also tired. He probably wrecked his hand trying to break the Ebony Thornwall.\u2019Crack\u2014His assumptions were quickly crushed.The wall surrounding him started falling apart. And in the blink of an eye, a hand broke through the opening.Grasp\u2014\u201cKugh!\u201dChilde was choked as he was raised up into the air by his neck.Slam\u2014!After raising him up high, YuWon immediately slammed his head into the ground. Then YuWon imbued mana into his fist and started bashing his face in.Wham, wham, wham\u2014!The ground shook as Childe\u2019s head was buried deep into the ground.Blood dripped from YuWon\u2019s fist, a result of being injured from breaking through the Ebony Thornwall.\u201cI\u2026 will not\u2026 die\u2026\u201dDespite the fact that his head was being pushed into the ground, Childe was smiling. Even after being pummeled with punches strengthened by [Gigantification,] he only had a broken nose and teeth. He didn\u2019t look all that hurt. His body was much tougher than it had appeared.\u201cYou\u2019re as persistent as the rumors said.\u201dChilde the Chimera Creator was no ordinary boss. He was a Ranker from a thousand years ago, and he was set to soon become a participant in the Tutorial and reclimb the Tower as a player. It was for that moment that Childe had long been preparing his body.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 immortal.\u201dAfter attaching body parts from countless participants and experimenting on himself for almost a thousand years, his entire body was harder than steel.His body had been strengthened through dark magic experiments unrelated to the Constitution stat. This is why, in the future, when Childe started climbing the Tower again, he came to be known as the \u2018Undead Chimera.\u2019This was the real reason why Childe was dangerous. He had a body that couldn\u2019t be broken or injured. He was the true boss of the Tutorial, far stronger than the unsealed Chimera.Despite that, YuWon reached out and grabbed his shoulder.\u201cYou\u2019ll be able to see everything as long as you have these.\u201dSnap\u2014Riiiiip\u2014!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Childe screamed in pain.YuWon had forcibly torn off his right arm.Childe grasped where his arm was so easily torn off.\u201cMy arm. My aaaarm\u2014!\u201cYou attached body parts together like they were toys. No wonder it came off so easily.\u201dFwoosh\u2014The cause of YuWon\u2019s red vision, [Cinder Eyes,] the eyes that can see through all of creation, allowed YuWon to see the faint lines that connected Childe\u2019s body together.YuWon reached for Childe\u2019s other arm.Grasp\u2014\u201cP-Please\u2026 STOOOOOOP\u2014!\u201dSnap\u2014Riiip\u2014!Even if it had been strengthened through experiments, it was still a body that was made from attaching the body parts of other participants. And as it was not a perfect whole, the conjoining points were bound to be weaknesses.\u201cWhy are you asking me to stop?\u201dYuWon grabbed Childe\u2019s thigh next. While tightening his grasp, YuWon looked Childe straight in the eyes.\u201cHave you forgotten how many people you\u2019ve torn apart?\u201d___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Chapter 29The meeting regarding the Tutorial was almost wrapped up.They had managed to discuss a few possible scenarios regarding the Chimera Creator:If neither [Cinder Eyes] nor [Gigantification] were obtained, do not even try.If only one of them was obtained, leave it up to the user\u2019s judgement.But if both were obtained\u2026\u201cYou have to defeat the Chimera Creator.\u201dThe Chimera Creator, after reclimbing the Tower, became a High Ranker that time around, bringing chaos to the Tower again.He used the players of the lower floors as ingredients, and as a High Ranker, he had gained enough power to rival a guild between the power he cultivated for a thousand years and the human-type Chimeras.So in order to prevent any more travesty, Son OhGong had to personally go after him again.That\u2019s why the Chimera Creator had to be defeated.\u201cGetting both Cinder Eyes and Gigantification during the Tutorial\u2026\u201dEyes that can analyze the essence and weakness of all creation and the ability to exude the same power as a Giant, one of the dominant races of the Tower. With those two powers combined, it should be entirely possible to tear apart the Chimera Creator\u2019s limbs and snap his neck.As the meeting regarding the Tutorial was ending, YuWon said the following:\u201cAn unbelievable guy is going to be born.\u201dAt that point, he had never imagined that the unbelievable guy would end up being him.* * *[You have defeated the \u2018Chimera Creator.\u2019][You have accomplished an impossible achievement.][Due to accomplishing an impossible achievement, the calculation of your reward will be delayed.][The Tutorial has been finalized.][You have leveled up.][You have leveled up.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Dexterity increased by 2.][Your Constitution\u2026][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 8.24%.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Dexterity increased by 1.]YuWon\u2019s level had increased by two. It was an exorbitant amount of EXP, being able to level up twice at his current level. And on top of that, thanks to reaching a higher completion rate, YuWon also obtained two additional stat points.\u2018So this guy was recognized as a boss, like Suruhtra.\u2019This was a good thing for YuWon. Had the system not recognized Childe as a boss, not only would he have not received EXP, he also wouldn\u2019t have received any bonus rewards.Luckily that didn\u2019t occur, and as an additional bonus, the completion rate for [Heaven-Slaying Star] shot up, which was great news for YuWon.\u2018With this, the completion rate is now over 10%. I got an additional two stat points. Does that mean it\u2019s one stat point per 5%?\u2019This meant that he\u2019d be able to earn a total of 20 stat points unrelated to levels by completing the skill.YuWon had thought that the effect was pretty lackluster for an A plus-rank skill, but it turned out to be pretty decent.YuWon turned his head and looked around.Thud\u2014Flop\u2014The human-type Chimeras that were in battle suddenly started dropping dead as if their souls had left their bodies. It was all because Childe, the one who was controlling them, died.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with them?\u201d\u201cThey suddenly flopped over.\u201d\u201cIs it over?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not getting back up, right?\u201d\u201cGrrrr\u2014\u201dHargaan\u2019s team and the unsealed Chimera stayed on guard against the fallen human-type Chimeras. They were concerned that the Chimeras might get back up at any moment and charge at them again.\u201cThey won\u2019t be getting up, so don\u2019t worry. The boss is dead.\u201dHargaan\u2019s team untensed after hearing YuWon\u2019s reassurance.\u201cR-Really?\u201d\u201cPhew\u2014\u201d\u201cI thought we were actually dead.\u201d\u201cIs anyone injured?\u201dNow that the battle was over, Elador and Paladinte started looking after their teammates with their healing abilities.Quite a few of them had been injured. They might have been high-ranking participants, but their opponents were human-type Chimeras created by the Chimera Creator. Had the unsealed Chimera not helped them, more than half of them probably would have died.\u2018The reason why none of them died is probably\u2026\u2019YuWon looked over at Hargaan who was tending to his injured teammates.\u2018\u2026 Thanks to this guy.\u2019He only got a few glimpses during the fight, but Hargaan\u2019s skills far exceeded what YuWon had expected.Hargaan used his golden lightning to slaughter the human-type Chimeras and protect his teammates. And despite all that, it seemed that he was neither tired nor injured.\u2018He really is talented, even among the Olympians. He might have even been able to become the next Hercules\u2026\u2019\u201cWhere\u2019s the reward?\u201d asked Hargaan. Seeing how it was taking a while for the reward to be calculated, he signaled to YuWon and turned around. \u201cCome with me for a bit. You guys stay back.\u201dYuWon nodded his head and followed behind him. He had a rough idea what Hargaan wanted to say.He led YuWon to boss room No.3 where the Chimera boss was originally sealed. Without the Chimera, the cave was completely empty.\u201cI won\u2019t ask who you are or how you knew about the connection between that Ranker and the Tutorial.\u201dIt bothered Hargaan. He had heard Childe speak about YuWon and Olympus. However, that had to be tabled for now.\u201cYolche\u2019s injured.\u201dYuWon nodded his head, listening to Hargaan.The one who took the biggest injury during this battle was Yolche. It appeared as though she was stabbed in the hip, and Elador was busy treating her right now.\u201cDid you really have to do that?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the Chimera Creator?\u201d\u201cYeah. This was a Tutorial that could have been cleared just by defeating the sealed Chimera. We didn\u2019t have to defeat that guy.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019d normally be the case.\u201d\u201cNormally?\u201dHargaan couldn\u2019t believe YuWon\u2019s words. Saying something like \u201cnormally \u201d when they had challenged the Tutorial\u2019s boss after only five days. Even Zeus, his father, had never managed to set this kind of record in the Tutorial.Yet here YuWon was claiming that just defeating the sealed Chimera in record time would be \u201cnormal\u201d after having challenged something far beyond that.\u201cYou could have set the greatest record to date just by defeating the sealed Chimera. How far do you have to go until you\u2019re satisfied? Will you only be satisfied once you and all your comrades are dead?\u201dYolche wasn\u2019t the only one who had fallen into danger. The reason why she got injured in the first place was because she tried to protect the rest of her teammates from the human-type Chimeras. And unlike Hargaan, she wasn\u2019t strong enough to fight while protecting others.And it wasn\u2019t just Yolche. It was the same for the rest of Hargaan\u2019s teammates. They had faced a crisis where more people could have been injured, or worse, some could have even died.\u201c\u2018How far,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dYuWon closed his eyes and took a moment to think. How far indeed did he have to go?Even now, YuWon could vividly picture it when he closed his eyes.The Outer Gods. The gods from another world outside the Tower. \u300aOne Who Couldn\u2019t Be Born\u300b, \u300aDespair that Reaches the Skies\u300b, \u300aGloom Trapped in a Swamp\u300b, and\u2026 \u300aFoolish Chaos.\u300b\u2018How far do I have to go?\u2019YuWon thought back to the fight with \u300aFoolish Chaos.\u300bIn order to just defeat him, Asura, Vishnu, and various other Rankers had lost their lives.And exactly how many bastards like him existed? There was no way for YuWon to know.That\u2019s why YuWon couldn\u2019t let himself be shackled by the laws of this small and tiny Tower. He had to become endlessly powerful while purging the rotten parts of this world, leading it to become even stronger. Or else this world would meet its end.\u201cI\u2026\u201d YuWon shook his head in response, \u201c\u2026 don\u2019t know.\u201dHe had never thought about it before. How far would he have to go in order to face the gods from another world?YuWon felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe, and a suffocating pressure weighed down on his entire body. This was a much harder question to answer than fighting Childe.\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d Hargaan asked back in confusion.He tried to read YuWon\u2019s face. YuWon had always appeared confident and laid back up until now. He was absolutely certain that no one was as strong as YuWon during their time as a newbie. However, YuWon still didn\u2019t seem satisfied, as if he had only just taken the first step towards his goal.Instead of responding to Hargaan\u2019s question, YuWon replied with a question out of the blue. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for a team, right? One you can get through thick and thin with.\u201dHargaan looked confused, not understanding what YuWon was talking about.YuWon continued, \u201cThis is why. This is the reason why I\u2019m not looking for a team right now.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018This is why\u2026\u2019?\u201dHargaan suddenly remembered what YuWon had said before.\u201cI don\u2019t have any intention of forming a team with people who have a different destination than me. That\u2019s my answer.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The reason why YuWon hadn\u2019t made a team. Hargaan had previously thought he was simply being stubborn, not wanting to work together with people who had a different goal. And it was only natural that he thought YuWon was just being stubborn back then.It was very rare for a team created during the Tutorial to stay together forever. Unless they were connected by blood like Olympus, most people joined other teams or disbanded according to their needs. And Hargaan had thought YuWon didn\u2019t want something like that.\u2018So that wasn\u2019t it,\u2019 Hargaan thought.YuWon wasn\u2019t worried about his team changing or disbanding part way through. A team that would stay together forever for a common goal wasn\u2019t what YuWon wanted.What YuWon wanted were comrades that were strong enough to face extreme dangers. The team had to be made of people who could walk the same path as him because the path he was destined to walk was far more dangerous than Hargaan could ever imagine.\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s better if you give up now. If you pull someone like me into your team, who knows when something like this might happen again.\u201dWith that, YuWon turned away, but it wasn\u2019t so he could go back to where the rest of them were. It was because of the tall man that had suddenly appeared behind him.\u201cHave you been waiting a long time?\u201d asked YuWon.\u201c\u25b7 Well, it seemed like you two were having an important conversation.\u201dIt was the giant hobo, the Tutorial\u2019s Administrator.Having been unable to notice the Administrator\u2019s presence until then, Hargaan was shocked to see the tall man.Seeing YuWon and the Administrator greet each other, Hargaan carefully asked YuWon, \u201cWho\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cThe Tutorial\u2019s Administrator.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dHargaan froze for a second, as if he didn\u2019t understand, before continuing, \u201cT-The Administrator?!\u201dAfter shouting in surprise, Hargaan quickly shut up and measured the Administrator\u2019s reaction.Even though YuWon had already met this one a few times, Administrators weren\u2019t normally so easy to meet. Unless you specifically requested a meeting with them, they rarely ever showed themselves. And they usually stayed on the sidelines, having delegated most of their work to the Lackeys.The Administrators of each floor were beings on par with the highest Rankers. They were essentially in the same position as the \u201cBig Three\u201d of Olympus.\u201cA-As a son of Olympus, I\u2019d like to thank you for your presence, Administrator.\u201dIt was only natural for Hargaan to show proper respect to the Administrator. Unlike normal participants, as a descendant of Olympus, he knew a lot about Administrators.\u201c\u25b7 Oh, yeah.\u201dThe Administrator, however, didn\u2019t seem all that pleased with his greeting.YuWon quickly guessed the reason behind the Administrator\u2019s reaction.\u201cDon\u2019t be like that. You should properly accept his greetings since he\u2019s got nothing to do with that.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 I refuse.\u201d\u201cDo you really have to be like that?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Just thinking about how much more work I have now because of those bastards makes me want to go pull out Zeus\u2019s beard right now.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dNot knowing the current situation, Hargaan was confused as to what they were talking about. However, he knew he couldn\u2019t just demand an answer right now in the presence of the Administrator.Still, Hargaan could at least tell that the Administrator was currently hostile against Olympus.\u201c\u25b7 Also, thinking about what I\u2019m about to hear from the other guys again because of you\u2026\u201dThe Administrator sounded like he had a headache.The Chimera Creator was a boss that had maintained the ecosystem of the Tutorial for almost a thousand years. It was all part of the Administrator\u2019s plan. Childe created the sealed Chimera, maintaining the Tutorial\u2019s system on repeat.The Tutorial\u2019s Administrator had been preparing a different boss to substitute for the sealed Chimera before the thousand year contract ended. However, the Chimera Creator was suddenly killed, even though the preparations weren\u2019t ready yet.\u201c\u25b7 For the foreseeable future, the difficulty of the Tutorial is going to seriously decrease.\u201dHe might have to just throw in any boss, even if it didn\u2019t meet the difficulty requirement. And having to come up with a suitable reward, the Administrator felt like his head was going to explode from a migraine.\u201cDid you come here just to complain?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Not just to complain.\u201d\u201cJust give me the reward already, please.\u201dTechnically speaking, the Chimera Creator wasn\u2019t a preset boss in the Tutorial. He was another hidden piece like Suruhtra. And the Administrator had made an appearance to give YuWon a reward for defeating that hidden piece.\u201c\u25b7 You\u2019re much more impatient than you appear.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have all day either.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 That\u2019s true.\u201dThe Administrator looked down at YuWon, not really thrilled with the situation, as he opened his hand.\u201c\u25b7 Here you go.\u201dFlash\u2014___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Chapter 30A bright light floated out of the Administrator\u2019s palm.It was a black-colored light, emitting a holy glow.Since it was black, one would think it would cause darkness, but instead it lit up its surroundings.The light dissipated after a short while, and what remained was a small onyx crystal.The Administrator handed the tiny crystal to YuWon.\u201c\u25b7 Where you use it is up to you, and protecting it will also be up to you.\u201dYuWon took the black crystal from the Administrator\u2019s hand.Fsss\u2014As YuWon grabbed the crystal, a foreign\u00a0 mana started circulating around YuWon\u2019s palm. It was the energy from the crystal.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes perked up.[Dark Divine Crystal]\u15cc A fragment that holds the darkness of the genesis.

And not only that, but an increase in efficiency of the changed mana.YuWon couldn\u2019t believe that this was only an unrefined crafting material.\u2018I guess that\u2019s natural since it\u2019s called the Dark Divine Crystal.\u2019For an item of this caliber to appear at this point\u2026 It was the reward for achieving a better record than any previous participant as well as defeating the secret boss of the Tutorial.YuWon had expected a pretty good reward. He had half-expected either an A-rank or above skill or an item that you\u2019d only see a Ranker use. However, this far exceeded his expectations.\u2018The other name for this is\u2026\u2019Clench\u2014YuWon tightly grasped the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d in his hand.\u2018The fragment of the Helm of Invisibility.\u2019Hades was one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d of Olympus. The \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d was one of the items used by him, one of the strongest items in Olympus. And an essential crafting material for the Helm was this \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300dThis was one of the items YuWon had to obtain after he returned to the past. He didn\u2019t really have an idea of how to obtain it, so he had planned to take it from Olympus much later, but he ended up finding it in an unexpected place.\u2018At this moment in time, only the fragment of the Lightning Bolt exists. Out of the remaining two fragments, one of them is now in my possession.\u2019This was a reward that was not in his original plan.\u2018I know where the third fragment, the fragment of the Trident, is. The problem is the fragment of the Lightning Bolt\u2026\u2019YuWon looked away from the Administrator, turning his head to Hargaan, who was waiting with great excitement.\u2018I might be able to gather them sooner than I thought.\u2019\u201cWhat? Why?\u201d Hargaan asked, confused by the expression YuWon was making while staring at him.YuWon simply shrugged, not saying a word, and looked back at the Administrator.\u201cWill we be departing now?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Now that all the conditions have been met, yes.\u201dThe Administrator turned to glance over at Hargaan.\u201c\u25b7 The others will get their reward according to their CP. Hey, Olympian kid. I\u2019m not thrilled about it, but your reward won\u2019t be half-bad either.\u201dHargaan had set the second highest contribution after YuWon during the boss raid. Though he couldn\u2019t be compared to YuWon, who controlled the unsealed Chimera and defeated the Chimera Creator by himself, Hargaan had managed to defeat dozens of human-type Chimeras.\u201cI-Is that true?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 That\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThank you, Administrator, sir.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 \u2026 Tch.\u201dNot content, the Administrator looked up and down at Hargaan before turning back to YuWon.\u201c\u25b7 Anyway, this will be our last time. You\u2019re not planning on causing just as much trouble once you make it up there, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 That sounds like a \u2018no.\u2019\u201dThe Administrator looked down at the fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d in YuWon\u2019s hand.\u201c\u25b7 Though that\u2019d be par for the course. With that in your possession, you\u2019ll be able to rampage even harder.\u201dRumble\u2014The ground started shaking.No, it wasn\u2019t the ground that was shaking. It was the space they were standing in.\u2018It\u2019s starting.\u2019This was something YuWon had already experienced once.The world in front of them shook violently, and their ears were filled with white noise. Their bodies felt like gravity had disappeared, and they were levitating.It was now time to say goodbye to the Tutorial.\u201cNow\u2026 again\u2026\u201dThrough the white noise, Hargaan\u2019s voice could be heard faintly.For some, this was the end. Some people were satisfied with just reaching the Tower, remaining on the lower floors.However, this was only the start for Hargaan, and for YuWon, this wasn\u2019t even the beginning.Fwoosh\u2014!YuWon and Hargaan suddenly disappeared, along with all the participants in the Tutorial. The Tutorial ended for everyone simultaneously, and they went up a floor to the world above.\u201c\u25b7 If you\u2019re going to cause trouble\u2026\u201dThe Administrator lifted his chin, looking up.At first, YuWon was just a single participant from a small world he didn\u2019t even care about. However, YuWon had left an impression on him unlike anyone before.\u201c\u25b7 \u2026 It might not be that bad for you to become the wave that shakes up this Tower.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *[1st \u2013 Kim YuWon : 674880cp][2nd \u2013 Hargaan : 121110cp][3rd \u2013 Yolche : 48960cp][4th \u2013 \u2026\u2026[\u2026\u2026][TIME LIMIT : 598 : 55 : 40][Calculations for the rankings have been completed.][You have obtained 67488 points.*]*TL/N: This is points as in their currency.[You have set a new record.][Additional points will be rewarded.][You have obtained 50000 points.][You have obtained \u2018?\u2019s egg.\u2019][Welcome to the 1st Floor. ]Fwoosh\u2014!The white light faded as YuWon\u2019s vision returned to normal.Because of the string of messages he got, instead of checking the location he arrived in, YuWon first checked the rewards he obtained from his contribution points.\u2018An egg?\u2019The reward was automatically placed into his inventory.When he put his hand inside his inventory, he felt an egg the size of a fist.\u2018What is this thing?\u2019YuWon thought he had obtained plenty of rewards, now that he was in possession of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d However, that didn\u2019t mean he had no expectations.He had racked up over 670,000cp, and since he passed the Tutorial in historic record time, he knew that there would be a reward fitting for it, but an unexpected and not even properly named egg was given to him.\u201cWe\u2019re here,\u201d Hargaan mumbled, as YuWon looked up.The unfathomably high ceiling was as high as the sky. One could only wonder how many kilometers high it might be.Though this was only a single floor, the 1st Floor was practically a world of its own.Around YuWon, there were tens of thousands of participants, no, people who had earned the title of \u2018players,\u2019 around him. They had arrived in the outer Tower region on the 1st Floor. Known as the \u2018Meadow of Beginnings,\u2019 this was the place where the players first stepped foot in the Tower.And around the field\u2026\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\u201cNewbies?\u201d\u201cAlready?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there supposed to be quite a bit of time before the Tutorial is over?\u201d\u201cNo way! They already finished?\u201dGazes descended upon the newly arrived players. It was the pre-existing players. They had been camping out, so they could welcome the new players that just cleared the Tutorial and entered the Tower.Many guilds had acted quickly to recruit new players, but they were caught off guard by their unexpectedly early arrival.\u201cIt seems like even Olympus is here this time.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re as busy as always. Some must have gone off somewhere though. Not everyone is here yet.\u201dSeeing some familiar faces, Hargaan frowned. Making contact with guilds would be pointless, so instead, he turned to YuWon.\u201cWhat about guilds? You don\u2019t have any intentions of joining?\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Olympus?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cNot surprising. You don\u2019t even have any plans of forming a team, so why would you join a guild?\u201d Having expected this answer, Hargaan shrugged his shoulders. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll keep my promise, since it\u2019s a no-brainer who earned more CP.\u201dHargaan was talking about granting him a favor since YuWon won.YuWon nodded in response. Though it was a verbal promise, Hargaan wasn\u2019t the kind of guy to break a promise he\u2019d made.\u201cOh, and about earlier.\u201d\u201cEarlier?\u201d\u201cYour conversation with the Administrator. Did something happen between Olympus and the Administrator?\u201dIt seemed that Hargaan was concerned about what the Administrator had said, which of course he was. The Administrator had said he wanted to pull out Zeus\u2019s beard if he could, and Hargaan had never heard of the Administrator feeling so hostile to Olympus.\u201cThe Olympus you know is probably a place that\u2019s righteous and uses its power to maintain order inside the Tower.\u201d\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d\u201cIf you want to know everyone\u2019s true colors, you should slowly uncover it yourself. You wouldn\u2019t believe me even if I told you.\u201dAnd with those words, YuWon walked away, following the signs.The Meadow of Beginnings had signs prepared for the new players. It pointed towards the direction of the 1st Floor city, which was in the central region of the floor.\u201cWhen you get to town, first register as a player. That way we can at least stay in touch. Also\u2026\u201d While watching YuWon walk away, Hargaan hesitated before continuing, \u201cBe careful of fruit flies.\u201dAfter hearing those words, YuWon paused for a second, nodded his head, and waved his hand.Fruit flies. YuWon knew what Hargaan meant. Even though he also hadn\u2019t joined a guild in his previous life, he had experienced them before.\u2018Jackals.\u2019Tmp, tmp\u2014Uninterested in guilds, YuWon avoided the existing players as he headed towards the city.\u2018Jackals\u2019 was a nickname given to them for the silly wolf masks that they wore. It referred to the guys that had given up on moving to the next floor and simply waited for the end of every Tutorial. They were bastards that went after new players who weren\u2019t able to join any guilds in the Meadow of Beginnings, and their favorite prey were new players that went around alone, like YuWon.\u2018I knew it.\u2019When he turned his head, he heard breathing in the tall grass.\u2018So they\u2019ve started tailing me.\u2019He didn\u2019t even have to use [Cinder Eyes.] His high Perception was enough for him to realize how many there were and where.\u201cHe\u2019s actually alone?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dud?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any companions.\u201d\u201cSomething feels off. Should we just let him go?\u201d\u201cWhy should we let him go? We just need to quickly take care of him. Can\u2019t you tell? That\u2019s a Pyromancy Robe.\u201d\u201cA Pyromancy Robe?\u201d\u201cWow. We hit the jackpot\u2026\u201dThey whispered, watching YuWon. Though uninterested at first, after noticing the \u300cPyromancy Robe,\u300d their expectations shot through the roof.It wasn\u2019t really surprising. The \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d was among the highest tier items a Tutorial participant could have obtained. Even if it was given as part of the final reward for clearing the Tutorial, it was something that could only be obtained if you had ranked pretty high.\u2018There\u2019s roughly 20 of them. There\u2019s not that many\u2026 But a few of them actually have some pretty decent items.\u2019YuWon smiled faintly. He felt the fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d inside his pocket. His opponents were small fry, so it was the perfect time to test it out.\u2018Why don\u2019t I try it out?\u2019Whirr, whirr\u2014The \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d started emitting black light from YuWon\u2019s hand.

    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Chapter 31After YuWon had left, Hargaan stood in place for a moment.There were people waiting for him.\u201cSo they\u2019re here.\u201dA group made its way through the new players. A man wearing gold-plated armor and a helmet led a group of about ten or so players.Hargaan had locked eyes with some of the group members earlier, so he had wondered if they would come greet him. Apparently he guessed right.The group wore capes with an emblem of a large mountain, sword, and spear\u2014the symbol of Olympus.\u201cI, Agamemnon of Olympus, give my greetings to the one of great lineage.\u201d\u201cAgamemnon, you say? I think I\u2019ve seen you before.\u201d\u201cThank you for remembering me.\u201dAgamemnon got on one knee while facing Hargaan. As a player who hadn\u2019t become a Ranker yet, he had to show his respects according to Olympian lineage. But unlike his actions, Agamemnon looked at Hargaan with indifference.\u201cIs Ares well?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the same as always.\u201d\u201cI heard he became a High Ranker recently. Please pass along my congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dThe war maniac of Olympus, Ares. He was the player that Agamemnon followed. But also\u2026\u201cHowever\u2026 Lord Ares finds lineage more important than anything. He has ordered me to not pass along any of your messages until you find your birth mother.\u201d\u2026 Ares was renowned within Olympus for his bad personality.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\u201cAs you know, the Ruler of the Skies has little interest in children. And, sir, you do not know who your mother is\u2026\u201d\u201cYou disrespectful\u2014!\u201dSpark, crackle\u2014Rumble\u2014Electricity started flowing out of Hargaan\u2019s body. He tried to hold himself back, but his rage was already overflowing.Yet, in the midst of Hargaan\u2019s anger, Agamemnon wore a stoic look, the look of someone who didn\u2019t know what they did wrong. In fact, it was possible that he was enjoying Hargaan\u2019s rage.\u201cDo not be like this, sir. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of Lord Ares\u2019s personality. Lineage is something you create. I hope you\u2019ll have your own family one day.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Ugh.\u201dAgamemnon put out the fire that he himself started.Hargaan couldn\u2019t continue to show his anger after what Agamemnon said. It was true, the one that looked down on Hargaan was Ares, not him. Not to mention the fact that Agamemnon was one of Ares\u2019s men. If he accidentally went too far, it might end up souring his own relationship with Olympus.\u201cAlright. You guys may go.\u201d\u201cYes, sir. Farewell.\u201d After bowing, Agamemnon suddenly remembered something and asked, \u201cWho was that man earlier? Seeing as how he left by himself, he doesn\u2019t seem to be one of your teammates.\u201d\u201cThat guy?\u201dHargaan pressed his brow, recollecting YuWon, who had left first towards the city. He didn\u2019t quite know how to explain YuWon. Since he lost the bet and failed to recruit him into his team, he couldn\u2019t call him his companion. However, he couldn\u2019t say that it was just some guy he knew, since they still had unfinished business.His relationship with YuWon\u2026 After thinking hard about it for a moment, Hargaan slowly spoke, \u201cHe is\u2026 a friend?\u201dMaybe it\u2019s because he had finally said it once, Hargaan was able to say it again with more confidence.\u201cYeah, he\u2019s something like a friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dHargaan\u2019s answer left Agamemnon in confusion.\u201c\u2026 Like a friend?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The Jackals called the period when the Tutorial ended the time of harvest.They were a band that camped out on the 1st Floor whenever the Tutorial ended and went after new players.Even though they might have earned the qualifications to be players, they were still greenhorn kids that had just completed the Tutorial.The leader of the Jackals, Phatayo, was extra interested in this round\u2019s harvest.\u201cTo be over already\u2026 They were much faster than expected.\u201dIt was only about ten days since the Tutorial started, and it was only a little over five days since the 5th Tutorial had started. Yet the new players had already arrived\u2026\u201cThat was historically fast.\u201d\u201cThat would mean that quite a few of them will have good items.\u201d\u201cAnd because they took so little time, they should be that much weaker\u2026\u201dThis was great news for the Jackals. It meant that low-leveled new players with better items had entered the Tower.\u201cLet\u2019s quickly get into position and make sure to check that there are no guilds with them.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cAye, aye.\u201dIncluding Phatayo, a total of 20 Jackals hid themselves on the pathway between the Meadow of Beginnings and the city. They were aiming for teams of new players with five or less people, but their first target was unexpectedly a single player.\u201cWhat? Only one guy?\u201d\u201cIs he really alone?\u201d\u201cThis almost never happens\u2026\u201dOne of the Jackals asked Phatayo, \u201cBoss. Could this potentially be a bait?\u201dBaiting was one of the ways the guilds on the 1st Floor used to lure out Jackals. They purposely sent out a small number of new players to bait out the Jackals, catching them once they revealed themselves.However, Phatayo shook his head.\u201cNo. He\u2019s the only one around.\u201dPhatayo had a skill that let him see far into the distance. It even let him see through objects at close range. Thanks to that skill, he had been able to lead his gang of Jackals for a long time without getting caught.\u201cReally?\u201dTheir boss\u2019s words made the gang look closely at their prey. According to Phatayo, they had nothing to worry about.\u201cHe\u2019s actually alone?\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dud?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any companions.\u201d\u201cSomething feels off. Should we just let him go?\u201dOne of the Jackals got ticked off at his cowardly fellow Jackal. \u201cWhy should we let him go? We just need to quickly take care of him. Can\u2019t you tell? That\u2019s a Pyromancy Robe.\u201d\u201cA Pyromancy Robe?\u201d\u201cWow. We hit the jackpot\u2026\u201dThe \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d was an item that cost a whopping 50,000 points in the Shop. It was an item worth potentially struggling against a single opponent.\u201cI take it that everyone\u2019s in agreement\u2026\u201dWhile looking at his companions in the tall grass, Phatayo\u2019s face suddenly froze. His companions were confused why their boss froze up.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhere did he go?\u201d\u201cHe disappeared.\u201dThe guy that was walking down the road just a second ago had now disappeared. It was like the act of a ghost. They were sure he was just there\u2026\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cW-What the\u2014?!\u201d\u201cIs it an enemy?\u201dKling, klang\u2014!Slash\u2014The Jackals drew their weapons\u2014swords, spears, and bows. And one of them must have specialized in skills over weaponry because he pulled out a staff. But their preparations were for naught.Stab, pshk\u2014Spurt\u2014!\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cWho the fuck are you?!\u201d\u201cFucking come out!\u201dThe Jackals fell into chaos. They couldn\u2019t see their enemy.\u201cB-Boss\u2026\u201d\u201cI think\u2026\u201d\u201cThis must have been a bait.\u201dThe guy that was right before their eyes had disappeared. They couldn\u2019t believe it.\u2018There\u2019s no way a new player that just got to the 1st Floor has a stealth skill.\u2019They thought that this was probably an illusion skill used by a different player to lure them out.\u2018No wonder a new player was wearing a Pyromancy Robe. It was too good to be true.\u2019Grit\u2014Phatayo ground his teeth. He had already heard five screams, and he was in a situation where the enemy\u2019s sword might pierce his neck at any moment.\u201cEveryone, retreat for\u2014\u201dSlash\u2014!\u201cR-Rikuey!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cHe disappeared again!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dIn just a short moment, the people that were in the ambush apart from Phatayo dropped dead one after another. They weren\u2019t far from him, so that meant that the enemy was already nearby.Phatayo turned his head, and, though faint, he could see someone wearing a crimson robe.\u2018Could it be?\u2019Phatayo concentrated mana in his eyes. The skill that got him to his current position, [Falcon\u2019s Eye,] was activated.Whirr\u2014His vision got brighter, and he was able to see something faint.Slash\u2014!As the hazy figure swung his sword, Phatayo could see the crimson dragon robe and the enemy\u2019s face.The enemy disappeared right away. The only moment that he revealed himself was in the short instance when he swung his sword. However, to Phatayo\u2019s gang members who didn\u2019t have the [Falcon\u2019s Eye] skill, they probably saw nothing more than a quick flash.\u2018It\u2019s him.\u2019Phatayo\u2019s eyes widened.The crimson dragon robe. The long sword. Though he couldn\u2019t see it clearly, Phatayo was sure that this red flash was the new player that they had planned to rob.Thud\u2014Another Jackal lost their head, falling to the ground.It was him again, a player wearing red clothes and wielding a long sword.\u201cU-Uh\u2026\u201dPhatayo started stumbling back.\u2018He wasn\u2019t bait.\u2019The first new player to head towards the city from the Meadow of Beginnings. At first, Phatayo had just assumed he was a slightly skilled new player. Then he thought he had made a mistake and that he was a \u2018bait\u2019 prepared by a guild to lure them out.Phatayo realized he was wrong twice. This guy wasn\u2019t something like bait. He was a \u2018sword\u2019 that was personally out to kill them.\u2018With this much skill, he must be a player from the upper floors. But why? A player from an upper floor would get penalized if they interfered with the 1st Floor.\u2019He was overwhelmed with confusion, but he decided to stop thinking, realizing that now wasn\u2019t the time to stand around and think.\u201cR-Run away\u2014!\u201d Phatayo shouted as he ran full force into the forest.Well, he tried to run full force.Slice\u2014\u201cDon\u2019t be annoying and go too far.\u201dA warm sensation enveloped his feet, as Phatayo\u2019s field of vision slowly tilted downwards.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201d Phatayo screamed in agony, his feet having been cut off.Thud\u2014Having lost his feet to support him, he fell to the ground. Phatayo tried to crawl forward with his arms.\u201cUh, ugh\u2026\u201dStab\u2014\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dA sword pierced his hand. He looked back to the shadow that covered him. The hazy figure started becoming clearer until YuWon, wearing the \u300cPyromancy Robe,\u300d became fully visible.\u201cYou were going to get caught immediately anyway.\u201dStomp\u2014YuWon pressed down on Phatayo\u2019s shoulder with his foot.\u201cKugh\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to ask you something. If you answer it earnestly, I\u2019ll at least send you off peacefully.\u201d\u201cKugh\u2026 K-Kill\u2026 t-this son of a bitch. Kill him\u2026\u201d\u201cWho are you talking to?\u201dAfter hearing YuWon\u2019s words, Phatayo quickly glanced around him. Just earlier he had a team of almost twenty people around him. They were Jackals that had been hunting new players for over ten years, but now all that remained were headless corpses.\u201cI get what you want, but you should have reasonable expectations of corpses.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re going to keep acting like you\u2019re mute\u2026\u201dPress\u2014Crack\u2014\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just continue on with what I was doing.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019ll talk! I\u2019ll talk!\u201dPhatayo screamed from the agonizing pain of his shoulder getting crushed.Then the force pressing down on his shoulder eased.YuWon kept his foot on Phatayo as he proceeded to ask him questions.\u201cDo you know where the guy by the name of Mu WoonCheon is?Phatayo was shaken by YuWon\u2019s question.\u201cH-How\u2026?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t continue his sentence.The sudden change in Phatayo\u2019s expression made YuWon smirk.\u201cWow.\u201dPress\u2014YuWon pressed down on Phatayo with more force.\u201cJackpot on my first try.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Chapter 32YuWon was attacked by a few more Jackal gangs after that, but every single confrontation ended similarly.There were some groups as small as 10 people and some as large as 30, but none of them managed to find YuWon while he used [Stealth.]The most skilled Jackal ended up being Phatayo, among the first ones he had encountered. He was at least able to vaguely see through YuWon\u2019s [Stealth.]Though none of this was really all that surprising. To begin with, it would be weird for a skilled player to be in a Jackal group. They might have the nickname of a ferocious beast, but that was only the case to new players who knew nothing about the Tower. At the end of the day, Jackals were just a band of dropouts that didn\u2019t believe they could climb the Tower.After taking care of multiple Jackal groups, YuWon finally arrived in the city.This was the central region inside the 1st Floor, and countless players lived here. Using points as currency, they had formed a society here.And within the city\u2026\u201cOne order of Martial Realm meat stir-fry, and an aguardiente* please. Here\u2019s 5p.\u201d*TL/N: Terms for alcoholic beverages that contain 29%-60% ABV (Alcohol by Volume).YuWon went to the restaurant called Tara.He found food from the Martial Realm quite appetizing. Not only was it similar to food from his world, but YuWon had always liked Chinese food. When the apocalypse struck, he wasn\u2019t able to have any for decades, but here, he was able to have as much as he wanted by just paying a few points.\u201cHere\u2019s the stir-fry and aguardiente.\u201dThe owner of the establishment brought him his food and the bottle of alcohol, which was the size of a child\u2019s palm.While eating his food, YuWon looked out the window of the restaurant.\u2018It\u2019s delicious.\u2019The food was as delicious as he had remembered.Tara was a restaurant on the 1st Floor that YuWon used to frequent.\u2018It went out of business about 20 years ago\u2026\u2019Pour\u2014After having a sip of the aguardiente, he could feel the warm fuzziness of the alcohol spreading throughout his body.This was also his first drink in a long time.YuWon didn\u2019t enjoy being drunk, but he always welcomed a beverage to complement his meal.\u201cIt was delicious. Have a great day.\u201dFeeling good, YuWon gave the restaurant owner an additional 5p as a tip.Having received a large tip, which wasn\u2019t very common, the restaurant owner smiled widely.Next, YuWon went over to a cafe with a nice view.\u201cPlease give me an order of any tea and fruit please.\u201dThe buzz from the alcohol wore off quickly. YuWon utilized the mana inside his body to scatter the drunk feeling from within.At the terrace at the top of a building, Longjing* tea was served to him.*TL/N: A type of green tea, also known as Dragon Well tea.It wasn\u2019t a very expensive tea. You could find it in just about any cafe within the Tower.Appreciating the fragrance, YuWon wore a smile of satisfaction. It had been a long time since he could enjoy such a leisurely time and view.\u2018This is something that\u2019s nice about having returned.\u2019After going all out, non-stop, he had slowly become fatigued.YuWon looked at the view from the 5th Floor where the cafe was located.The city in the central region of the 1st Floor was far bigger than Seoul. It had high-rise skyscrapers, restaurants that sold food from various worlds, cafes, pubs, and entertainment facilities. This world that operated with points as the currency looked quite peaceful and beautiful.The thought came to him that it was the right call to return.YuWon continued to drink his tea without thinking much more. And when he could see the bottom of his cup, he took out the fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d from his pocket.\u2018Unlike the real \u300cHelm of Invisibility,\u300d it\u2019s not perfect at [Stealth.] I wonder if it\u2019s because it\u2019s still unrefined, and I\u2019m not skilled enough.\u2019A fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility.\u300d Its original name was the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d It was a gem known to hold an infinite amount of power. The players from earth would even jokingly call it an \u2018Infinity Stone.\u2019 As such, it was an object that held tremendous amounts of mana. However, it was entirely up to the capability of the user to draw out and use that power.\u2018I\u2019m not sure about the limits of its power, but I\u2019ll need to refine it first.\u2019The Ruler of the Underworld, Hades. The \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d was an item used by him, and it granted perfect [Stealth.]YuWon guessed that the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d was an item that maximized the power of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d\u2018[Stealth] isn\u2019t the only problem.\u2019YuWon had previously seen Hades in battle wearing the \u300cHelm of Invisibility.\u300d\u2018The reason why Zeus was able to claim the position as the Ruler of the Skies and become the king of Olympus was because he had obtained the fragment of the Lightning Bolt first.\u2019It was an object that allowed the current Olympus and the Olympus of the distant future to exist.\u2018Who could properly handle this\u2026\u2019After finishing his tea, YuWon stood up. Break time was now over.\u2018I\u2019ll get to see Ahjussi again.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *After finishing taking a break, YuWon registered as a player at the Rankings Registration Office located at the center of the city.Player registration was a process where new players were given a number, a ranking, and a \u2018player kit.\u2019A player kit was a crystal that could be used by imbuing it with the user\u2019s mana. Because a mana\u2019s property was unique to each person like a fingerprint, once you registered your mana at the Rankings Registration Office, you could pull up a player\u2019s number and information on the kit by using their mana.In a way, a player kit was similar to a smartphone. You could look up various events and incidents around the Tower using the internet, and you could even communicate with someone on the same floor by using their registered number. A player kit was an essential item needed to live inside the Tower.\u201cWas it here?\u201dYuWon scratched his head while walking around according to his memories. He thought he kinda knew where it was, and it did turn out that he only kinda knew. It was actually incredibly difficult to find the location just by knowing the general direction it was in.\u2018And I don\u2019t really have anyone I can ask.\u2019In the end, he had to search for it by foot.And so YuWon ended up in an alleyway in the outskirts of the city.\u201cJ-Just a few points.\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026\u201d\u201cMy child is starving. Mister, please\u2026\u201dIf the center of the city was the day, then this place was the night. There was a gathering of beggars, dropout players, and citizens that were born inside the Tower.\u201cGive me everything you\u2014kugh!\u201d\u201cMichael!\u201d\u201cDamn it. You bastard! How dare you do this to our\u2014agh!\u201dNaturally, most of them chose to steal rather than beg, robbing the occasional players that entered the alleyway.There were four or five of them. And since they were guys that couldn\u2019t move onto the next floor or even find a proper job here, they were obviously weak.\u201cIf you really can\u2019t stand living like this, then go up.\u201dSnap\u2014\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t even think about taking this out on someone else.\u201dYuWon went ahead and broke an arm and a leg from each player that attacked him. He had no intention of showing pity.Most of the people that had decided to remain here were still experiencing the fear from the Tutorial, people who only managed to enter the Tower by surviving somehow. People who weren\u2019t confident they could overcome the trials on their own, and instead resorted to taking others\u2019 belongings.Pity? There was no one around who was capable of showing something like that.Klang, klang\u2014!A familiar sound.It came from quite a ways away. YuWon let go of the arm of the player that had attacked him, so he could go find the source of this sound that he had been looking for.Klang\u2014!The sound grew louder.In the deepest depths of a back alleyway, there was a shabby blacksmith that radiated intense heat.\u201cSo it was here.\u201dYuWon walked into the blacksmith\u2019s workshop. When he parted the curtains that were in place of a door, he felt a rush of even more intense heat.The entrance was only slightly hot, while the inside of the workshop was like being steamed alive.Klang\u2014!The rhythmic beat of hammering steel.But soon, a different sound emerged.Fshhhh\u2014The sound of plunging hot steel into water.From the room where the hammering was coming from, a voice came out.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you had to work in the morning?\u201dIt was a thick, rough voice.YuWon waited for the owner of the voice to walk out.A moment later,Creak\u2014From behind a firmly shut steel door, a blacksmith with a dark tan walked out.Thump\u2014The man walked with a limp. Holding a heavy hammer, he looked at YuWon with curiosity.\u201cHuh? Who are you?\u201dAfter looking him up and down, the man was pleasantly surprised. YuWon looked entirely normal, unlike the thugs and beggars that roamed the alleys.\u201cIsn\u2019t that the Pyromancy Robe? You don\u2019t look like you\u2019re from around these parts. Are you lost?\u201dThe man instantly recognized and commented on the \u300cPyromancy Robe.\u300d It wasn\u2019t all that surprising. It was a fairly well-known item, and it cost way too much for a player on the 1st Floor to wear. It was something you\u2019d normally never see in a slum like this.\u201cNo, I\u2019m in the right place.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cIs this not a blacksmith\u2019s workshop?\u201d\u201cWhat? You wanna buy some equipment?\u201dAfter listening to YuWon, the man picked his ear as if he had lost interest. He then pointed at a wall with some cheap equipment.\u201cIf you\u2019re fine with these, go ahead. Though I\u2019m not sure if they\u2019ll be any better than what you have already.\u201dAfter hearing the man speak, YuWon started appraising the items on the wall one by one.YuWon\u2019s brows furrowed.[Shabby Sword]\u15cc A sword so poorly made, the blade has no edge. It\u2019s more of a blunt weapon than a sword.The object was barely a sword, even having a pathetic description. A sword like this wouldn\u2019t even be able to cut an apple without imbuing mana into it. The apple would get smashed instead of sliced.\u201cThey\u2019re all failures.\u201dThe man frowned slightly at YuWon\u2019s brutally honest criticism. It might have been true, but he was talking about something he personally made. Who would be happy to hear their creation called a failure right to their face?\u201cIt seems you\u2019re not that talented at breaking stuff.\u201dThe blacksmith\u2019s expression shifted. He looked confused by what YuWon had said.YuWon looked away from the broken equipment and stared right at the man.\u201cYour name\u2019s Vulcaro, right, Ahjussi?\u201d\u201cAhjussi?\u201dThe man was surprised by YuWon calling him with familiarity. He knew his name. That meant that it was no coincidence that YuWon had entered his workshop, which was deep inside a hard-to-navigate slum.\u201cWho sent you here?\u201dVulcaro tightened the grip on his hammer. A weak mana radiated around him.YuWon quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out a player kit.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so wary. I\u2019m a new player that just got to the 1st Floor.\u201d\u201cA new player?\u201dVulcaro looked at the player kit in YuWon\u2019s hand.On the marble-like player kit, the number one was engraved into it. It signified the highest floor the player had conquered.The number one. It wouldn\u2019t make sense if a player that managed to earn a \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d in the Tutorial was unable to conquer the 2nd Floor. And in Vulcaro\u2019s eyes, YuWon didn\u2019t seem like a coward like the players in the slums that had given up, afraid of the Tower\u2019s trials.This meant that he really was a new player that hadn\u2019t challenged the 2nd Floor yet.\u201c\u2026 So you\u2019re telling the truth.\u201dVulcaro lowered his hammer back down.YuWon let out a sigh of relief. If their talk had gone sour and Vulcaro had swung his hammer, a catastrophe might have occurred.\u2018Ahjussi is as quick-tempered as always.\u2019YuWon was surprised that he\u2019d raised his hammer after simply being called Vulcaro.\u2018If I had called him by his real name, he might have actually thrown it at me.\u2019YuWon decided he should pretend to be ignorant of the truth for a little while. But with this, he had managed to make him slightly lower his guard.Vulcaro looked at YuWon with a gaze that was asking, \u2018So what business do you have with me?\u2019In response, YuWon showed his hand.\u201cThe reason why I came here wasn\u2019t to buy pre-made equipment, but\u2026\u201dFlash\u2014In YuWon\u2019s palm\u2026\u201cTo commission you to make me an item.\u201d\u2026 Was a black crystal. The fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d shone, letting out a black light.___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Chapter 33Vulcaro was a talented blacksmith. No, talented couldn\u2019t even begin to describe him because he was the best blacksmith that YuWon knew.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201dVulcaro immediately recognized the crystal in YuWon\u2019s hand. Well, to be more precise, it wasn\u2019t that he recognized what the crystal was. Instead, he recognized its value.\u201cCould I\u2026 take a closer look?\u201dYuWon nodded his head to Vulcaro\u2019s question.There was no reason to say no. Even if he didn\u2019t want to, he\u2019d have to give it to Vulcaro to hire him.Vulcaro limped closer to YuWon. He looked at the fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d up close, but since he had not been hired for a commission yet, he didn\u2019t reach for it. But it was more than enough for Vulcaro to understand the full value of the fragment.\u201cIt\u2019s an unrefined crystal.\u201dIt looked absolutely mesmerizing. Not only was the crystal radiating quite a bit of light, its energy also felt refined.However, it only appeared that way to normal players and blacksmiths. Vulcaro was able to recognize that it was an unrefined crystal just by looking at it. That meant that\u2026\u201cAre you able to refine it?\u201d\u2026 He knew how to refine it already.\u201cI certainly can, but\u2026\u201dVulcaro\u2019s voice trembled.YuWon studied his facial expression and the look in his eyes. He was hesitating, and the reason for his hesitation was clear to YuWon. It was easy to see what the problem was by looking around at the trash items hanging in the workshop.YuWon gave him time to think about it.After a long moment, Vulcaro spoke, \u201c\u2026 Where did you get this?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t made his decision yet, but it was a positive response.YuWon handed the fragment over to Vulcaro, and Vulcaro ended up receiving it before he could say anything.\u201cI got it as the Tutorial clear reward.\u201d\u201cAs the Tutorial clear reward? How did you receive something like this from\u2026?\u201dConfused, Vulcaro pulled out his player kit and checked the date. It was the season for the Tutorial, but there should still have been quite a bit of time before it was over and new players started roaming the central region.\u201cHow many days did it take?\u201d\u201cAbout five days and two hours.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a new record.\u201d\u201cYeah, and I was ranked first.\u201d\u201cYou were?\u201dVulcaro nodded after looking up and down YuWon\u2019s outfit.The \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d was a pricey item that cost 50,000 points. It would be hard to find someone who had an item of this caliber, not just among the new players, but even among players on the 10th Floor.Vulcaro knew that he wasn\u2019t just an ordinary guy, but for him to have placed first in the Tutorial while setting a historic record for the clear time\u2026\u201cSurely with that kind of record\u2026\u201dHis doubts on where YuWon got the item disappeared, and his face showed clear resolve.\u201cThe only thing I can do right now is refine it.\u201dIt was a yes.YuWon smiled wide. He didn\u2019t expect any more than that to begin with.\u201cIs it because you lack materials?\u201d\u201cUsing any old cheap material will just harm it. You need a material that can handle the power of the crystal.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026\u201dVucalro looked around his workshop. It was full of old, crappy equipment.\u201cAre you sure you want to leave this to me?\u201d\u201cYes, I do.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a crazy son of a bitch,\u201d Vulcaro cackled. He firmly grasped the fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d within his hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t think I\u2019d run away with this thing?\u201d\u201cDo you know what your eyes look like right now?\u201d\u201cMy eyes?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not too bad at physiognomy.*\u201d*TL/N: Physiognomy is the practice of assessing a person\u2019s character or personality from their outer appearance, usually the face.YuWon took a close look at Vulcaro\u2019s eyes.\u201cIf you wanted the crystal, I would see greed in your eyes, but instead, you look super excited.\u201dVulcaro turned his head in surprise. He saw the reflection of his face off a piece of armor hanging on the wall. Without realizing it, the corners of his lips had curled up, and his dead, muted eyes had recovered their shine.\u201cYou trust me? Even though it\u2019s an important item?\u201dHe said \u201cimportant,\u201d but that was an understatement of the fragment\u2019s value.Vulcaro\u2019s gaze was aimed at the crappy items hanging on the wall. He was asking if YuWon trusted him despite him being the creator of these awful items.YuWon nodded his head without hesitation. It was Vulcaro. Not to mention, there was no one else he could trust with this except him.\u201cOf course I believe in you.\u201d\u201cYou sound like you know everything about me.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a pretty good judge of character.\u201dA dull edge. A lackluster handle. Everyone would say that this sword was a failure. It was such a poor product, it felt like the metal used to create it had been wasted. It was to a degree that one would believe that a normal player, not a blacksmith, created it. But\u2026\u201cYou can crush the edges, and you can make a lame handle\u2026 but habits die hard.\u201dWhoosh\u2014YuWon lightly swung the sword around. It moved in a gentle line, and YuWon smiled softly.\u201cIt seems you forgot to ruin the balance of the sword while making it.\u201dYuWon tested out a few more swords, spears, etc. This one, as well as that one. It was the same no matter how many weapons he handled. They all had a perfect weight distribution. Though they had a dull edge and shabby appearance, every single weapon was perfectly balanced.This wasn\u2019t something that could happen just by using good materials and taking the time to sharpen the blade. These were the products of a skilled and experienced blacksmith that lived by the hammer.\u201cHahaha! You really are something.\u201dSeeing YuWon\u2019s actions made Vulcaro put his hand to his forehead while letting out a baffled laugh. He couldn\u2019t believe it.They were pieces of equipment Vulcaro had hung up around the entrance to trick people. But instead of just ignoring them and passing by, YuWon had seen the true essence of the blacksmith that made them. And of all people, it was a new player that was passing through the slums.\u201cWho are you? You seem like a Pure-Blood. Who are you affiliated with?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything like that.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have an affiliation? But you are a Pure-Blood, right?\u201d\u201cSomething similar.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re either a Pure-Blood or not. What do you mean, \u2018something similar\u2019?\u201dVulcaro looked down and let out a small laugh before looking back at YuWon.\u201cFine. I\u2019ll accept the job. Since you trust me, I\u2019ll do the best refining there is.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut, I have a condition.\u201dVulcaro zipped his lips.\u201cYou need to keep where you got this refined, as well as the fact that this object has been refined, a secret. You can do that, right?\u201dHe was doing everything he could to stay hidden.It was truly a pity that a blacksmith of his caliber was rotting away in hiding. However, there was nothing YuWon could do about that right now.\u201c\u2026 Of course.\u201dThe only thing he could do was keep his promise.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *YuWon gave Vulcaro his number.When you contact a number that\u2019s been registered into your player kit, as long as that player is on the same floor as you, you can communicate by talking with it like a cellphone.Ten days. It was longer than he had expected, but it wasn\u2019t an unbearably long time to wait.\u2018I had to remain on the 1st Floor for a while anyways.\u2019YuWon went and found an inn.Because of the influx of new players, the hospitality industry was at near max capacity. Luckily, a decent inn had an empty room, so YuWon was able to find a place to rest quickly.Set on clearing the Tutorial as fast as possible, he had been going at it full force without any proper rest or sleep.YuWon slept for over half a day, until the sun rose.\u201cBreakfast for one. I\u2019ll take whatever, as long as it comes out quickly.\u201dAfter waking, YuWon went down to the restaurant on the 1st Floor. It was a fairly large place. And after paying three points, breakfast was served. It was a pretty good spread.He had picked an inn at random, but it seemed that he had managed to find a pretty decent one.\u2018Ten days is plenty of time.\u2019YuWon picked up a piece of bread.\u2018The Jackals will get together four days after the Tutorial is over, so that\u2019ll be in two days.\u2019This was intel he gathered by asking the Jackals he had captured. He had asked a few groups of Jackals, and all their responses were the same. The time and location matched across the board.Now the real problem was the number of them.\u2018It\u2019d be more convenient if I could catch and kill them all alone\u2026\u2019YuWon went over his plans while chewing on his bread.\u2018But since I\u2019m unable to do that currently\u2026\u2019\u201cSo you were here.\u201dDrag\u2014YuWon looked at the man who sat down in the chair across from him. A man with wide shoulders and golden blonde hair who stuck out no matter the place. It was Hargaan.\u201cHow did you find this place?\u201dHargaan ordered his food and turned back to YuWon. It seemed he came without his companions.\u201cI searched all over for you. I asked around for the name of Kim YuWon, and this place came up.\u201d\u201cThat wouldn\u2019t have been easy.\u201d\u201cI got some connections. I ended up using some people.\u201dYuWon nodded his head in response to Hargaan\u2019s answer. He should have guessed.Floor One was where Olympus displayed the greatest amount of influence, and at the end of day, Hargaan was the son of Zeus, the Ruler of the Skies. Something like finding someone staying at an inn was probably a piece of cake.\u201cYou got a player kit, right? Give me your number.\u201d\u201cI never thought I\u2019d end up getting hit on by a guy.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t know you had jokes. I thought you\u2019d have a stale-ass personality.\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m exactly fun either.\u201dYuWon gave his number to Hargaan. When they were done exchanging numbers, Hargaan\u2019s food arrived.YuWon asked while taking a bite of his soup, \u201cWhen are you planning on climbing up the Tower?\u201d\u201cIn about five days.\u201d\u201cAnd what are you doing till then?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m planning on leveling in the outer region. I also need to increase my team\u2019s teamwork. I\u2019ll need at least five days for that.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dA normal conversation.Tak\u2014YuWon put down his spoon.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, do a job with me.\u201d\u201cA job?\u201dHargaan was surprised by the unexpected proposal, mentioning a job out of nowhere.This was the first time YuWon had suggested something to him first. He came unannounced to get his number, yet here was YuWon asking for something out of the blue.\u201cWhat kind of a job is it?\u201d\u201cThe Jackals.\u201dHargaan\u2019s ears perked at where the talk was going.\u201cI want to exterminate them.\u201d\u201cYou want to exterminate what?\u201dThe Jackals. They were the scourge of the 1st Floor. It was unknown how many there were or if they were a structured organization. So exterminating them was considered impossible.Yet here was YuWon suggesting exactly that.\u201cJust sorting them out would be a problem in itself, but I don\u2019t think this is something that\u2019s possible to do with just ten people.\u201d\u201cNot ten. Just two\u2014you and me.\u201dWhile wiping his lips with a napkin, YuWon watched Hargaan\u2019s shaken expression.\u201cIf you can\u2019t, I can do it alone.\u201d\u201cFirst, tell me more details.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit too early right now. Come back here tomorrow night. I\u2019ll tell you then.\u201d\u201cTomorrow night\u2026\u201dHargaan nodded his head. He didn\u2019t finish his meal. There were far too many thoughts inside his head for him to continue shoving food in his mouth.Drag\u2014Hargaan got up from the table first.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201d\u201cGoing so soon?\u201d\u201cI have a lot to take care of if I\u2019m going to make time to meet you tomorrow night.\u201dHargaan seemed to have taken quite a liking to the team he had formed during the Tutorial, trying to grow that team so they could climb the Tower together.\u2018He\u2019s really putting his heart into it.\u2019YuWon watched Hargaan leave the restaurant. And then\u2026\u201cIt seems like you\u2019ve been waiting for a while.\u201dHe looked back at the man sitting at the table behind him, who had been sitting with his back to YuWon.\u201cNow that that\u2019s over, why don\u2019t you tell me what business you have with me?\u201d\u201cI was quite surprised because Sir Hargaan showed up out of nowhere.\u201dThe man had been having a meal by himself and wore a hood.\u201cThis is our first time meeting each other, right? Nice to meet you.\u201dYuWon locked eyes with Agamemnon, who stood up from his seat.\u201cI came from Olympus. Are you free for a quick talk?\u201d___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Chapter 34Agamemnon sat down next to YuWon, smiling widely. It was kind of uncomfortable watching someone with a rough face like him forcefully smiling.\u201cHargaan is kin to the Ruler of the Skies\u2026\u201dYuWon stared at the coffee that Agamemnon ordered for him.\u201cShouldn\u2019t you have at least greeted him?\u201dAgamemnon shrugged in response, \u201cI couldn\u2019t due to my objective.\u201d\u201cYour objective?\u201d\u201cI came here to meet you.\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t have to spell that part out for me. So tell me, what do you want?\u201dYuWon\u2019s straightforward question made Agamemnon pause before answering.\u201cKim YuWon. I heard that you ranked first in this Tutorial.\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s words tipped YuWon off that he had looked into him.Ranking first place inevitably attracted attention because players that rank the highest in the Tutorial were most likely to become Rankers. And this Tutorial was special among all the Tutorials because it had completely overturned previous records. That\u2019s why there were so many guilds going after the pool of talented people from this Tutorial.\u201cAlso\u2026 Sir Hargaan was only second place.\u201dZeus\u2019s direct kin, Hargaan, had participated in this Tutorial. He had the potential to not only become a Ranker, but a High Ranker. Yet, he failed to clear the Tutorial in first place, all thanks to YuWon.\u201cFrom what I heard, it seems that there was a dominating lead between first and second place. Everyone\u2019s saying right now that a monster entered the Tower.\u201d\u201cWhat an honest compliment. Thanks for the kind words.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quite laid back.\u201dAgamemnon took a sip of his coffee.\u201cSir Hargaan mentioned how you two are like friends.\u201d\u201cLike friends?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that a strange thing to say?\u201d\u201cA bit.\u201dYuWon did find it odd. You were either friends or not friends.\u2018 \u2018Like friends,\u2019 he says.\u2019It wasn\u2019t all that hard to figure out if you thought about it. YuWon and Hargaan weren\u2019t friends yet. But Hargaan said he and YuWon were \u2018like\u2019 friends. That meant only one thing.\u2018So he wants to be friends.\u2019YuWon didn\u2019t know if he should like it or not. He presumed that, at least at first, Hargaan only wanted him to join his team because of his skills, which was likely the right assumption. And Hargaan probably saw him more amicably over time thanks to their rivalry. Now Hargaan looked at YuWon favorably. This wasn\u2019t a bad thing for YuWon.Agamemnon continued speaking, \u201cAnd it seems that you haven\u2019t formed a team yet.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t particularly like being associated anywhere.\u201d\u201cThat was a smart call. Connections you form during the Tutorial don\u2019t last since most players don\u2019t become Rankers. In fact, over half the players don\u2019t even attempt to climb the Tower.\u201dAgamemnon looked at YuWon with a soft smile.\u201cHowever, you\u2019re different. You have the potential to ascend beyond a Ranker and become a High Ranker. So, don\u2019t you think you should climb the Tower with people fit to accompany you?\u201dHis voice was filled with pride.YuWon got the gist of what he was saying. Actually, YuWon knew what business Agamemnon had with him the moment he showed up.\u201cJoin Olympus. Come under the graces of Lord Ares. We can prepare anything you want.\u201dYuWon guessed right. Agamemnon\u2019s goal was to recruit him into the guild.Olympus was, among the large guilds, the one that put the most effort into recruiting new players.YuWon smiled faintly. It was an interesting offer.\u201cAnything I want?\u201d\u201cYes. Lord Ares is different from a lowly being like Hargaan, who doesn\u2019t even know his own mother. He is the son of Lady Hera and Lord Zeus, a great being that has already become a High Ranker.\u201dAgamemnon reached his hand out to YuWon.\u201cIf you grab this hand, you will become one of Olympus and Lord Ares\u2019s men. It will be far better than joining hands with a mutt like\u2014\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dYuWon finally reached for his coffee.Gulp, gulp\u2014He gulped the lukewarm coffee, chugging it in one go.Clatter\u2014Drag\u2014\u201cThanks for the drink. I\u2019ll be going then.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dAgamemnon was shocked by what YuWon said as he got up from his chair.\u201cAre you refusing an offer from Olympus?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right.\u201dA snide smile and contempt filled Agamemnon\u2019s face as he stared at YuWon.\u201cWhat? \u2018Fit to accompany me\u2019? \u2018Doesn\u2019t know his own mother\u2019? \u2018Lowly being\u2019? And \u2018mutt\u2019?\u201d\u201cAre you taking sides because he\u2019s your friend? How could you refuse an offer from Olympus based on a flimsy relationship you formed during the Tutorial\u2026\u201d\u201cI even rejected the personal offer from Hargaan, Zeus\u2019s son, because I don\u2019t have any plans of being associated anywhere.\u201dYuWon asked Agamemon with a bit of a laugh, watching him stay in his seat, \u201cWhat about you, though? Zeus and Hera are Ares\u2019s parents, not yours.\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s face filled with rage, dripping with killing intent. If it weren\u2019t for the penalty of attacking a lower floor player, he might have already attacked YuWon.But YuWon was completely unphased by Agamemnon\u2019s reaction.\u201cI only have one answer.\u201dAs if he was finished, YuWon started walking away.\u201cI can\u2019t be seen with deviant lowlifes like you guys.\u201d* * *After YuWon had left, one by one, the customers left until the restaurant was silent. To be more precise, the customers had fled from the anger and killing intent exuding from Agamemnon.At the center of the restaurant, he remained alone, stewing in his anger.A moment later\u2026\u201cAre you okay, sir?\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s subordinates came to the restaurant looking for him.Agamemnon, who had been seated in place, trying to control his anger, slowly collected himself.\u201c\u2026 How many Jackals are we able to call on right now?\u201d\u201cThe Jackals, sir?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The Jackals.\u201d\u201cBut they are\u2026\u201dThe subordinate shut up, unable to finish his sentence. It was because he noticed the look in Agamemon\u2019s eyes. He knew because he had been serving him for a long time. If he ended up saying the wrong thing here, it could be his head.\u201cWe will need a few days.\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cCurrently, the Jackals are doing collections. They\u2019ll have to be finished with that before we\u2019re able to gather a significant number of them.\u201d\u201cDo we really need that much preparation in order to kill a single new player?\u201d\u201cPlease think rationally about this, sir. He\u2019s set a historic record for the Tutorial. Do you really think a moderate number of Jackals will do it?\u201dAfter hearing his subordinate\u2019s question, Agamemnon got lost in thought for a moment, nodding his head.Not just new players, but most players in the early floors would have a hard time dealing with Hargaan. And YuWon was someone that had finished the Tutorial with a higher ranking, garnering the attention of many Rankers.Agamemnon could understand his subordinate\u2019s hesitation. However\u2026\u201cThen prepare about a hundred men.\u201dHis mind had been made up.Grit\u2014Agamemnon ground his teeth, staring at the place YuWon had been sitting.\u201cWhen collections are over, kill Kim YuWon.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *\u201cSo how are you planning on exterminating the Jackals?\u201dTwo days later, Hargaan met up with YuWon again at night. It wasn\u2019t difficult to meet now that they had exchanged their player numbers.\u201cThere\u2019s a guy I have to meet.\u201d\u201cA guy you have to meet?\u201d\u201cIt took me a while to find where he lived.\u201dStep, step\u2014YuWon walked down the dark streets of the city.It was quiet. Everyone was either closing shop or had already gone home for the day.\u201cWhy are we in the marketplace?\u201d\u201cJust follow me.\u201dYuWon\u2019s eyes darted around the place as he walked.Hargaan, who was walking beside YuWon, saw his eyes, recognizing that they had changed.\u2018Those eyes again,\u2019 thought Hargaan.They were crimson-colored, the same eyes YuWon had while fighting against Childe, the Chimera Creator.\u201cScoundrel, are you a kin of that Monkey?\u201dThat was Childe\u2019s reaction when he saw YuWon\u2019s eyes. Though he said \u2018Monkey\u2019 in a degrading manner, Hargaan immediately knew who that \u2018Monkey\u2019 was.\u2018Son OhGong, \u2018The Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal,\u2019 \u2019 thought Hargaan.He was someone that had become a High Ranker after less than hundred years since starting his ascent of the Tower. He was famous among the players as the most talented fighter in the history of Rankers. Having raised his rankings on what seemed like a daily basis, he ultimately became part of the rulers of the Tower, one of the top High Rankers.But also\u2026\u2018Not only \u2018The Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal,\u2019 but he also has the same skill as hyung-nim.\u2019Many questions arose in Hargaan\u2019s mind. What exactly was YuWon\u2019s ability? Who was he really? And was he associated somewhere?\u2018Is the reason why he won\u2019t join Olympus because\u2026?\u2019Hargaan\u2019s steps came to a halt while watching YuWon walk ahead of him. He remembered one of the skills YuWon had used.\u2018Gigantification.\u2019It was a skill that blessed you with the power of the Giants. And it was a skill that only Hercules, the \u201cGiant Slayer,\u201d held within Olympus. However, it was a skill that all the Giants possessed. If YuWon was a Giant\u2026 And if that was the reason why he wasn\u2019t joining Olympus\u2026As Hargaan\u2019s train of thought continued\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201dYuWon suddenly stopped in front of a shop.It was a general store that sold all sorts of goods.\u201cMake sure you respond properly.\u201d\u201cRespond?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going in.\u201dHargaan followed YuWon into the store that had most of its lights off, as if it was preparing to close for the day.\u201cHey, owner.\u201dSomeone came outside from YuWon\u2019s call. It was a young man with a gentle face, wearing white clothes, his hair tied back.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019re closed for the day.\u201dThe baby-faced young man approached them with a warm response.\u201cBut if there is something you\u2019re looking for, please leave me your name and number, and I\u2019ll contact you tomorrow.\u201dThe young man pulled out a pen and notepad from his pocket.The inside of the store was silent for a moment, before YuWon spoke.\u201cMu WoonCheon,\u201d YuWon said while narrowing his eyes. \u201cI\u2019m looking for a guy named Mu WoonCheon.\u201dThe young man\u2019s expression was shaken.\u201c\u2026 Fuck.\u201dDash\u2014The young man turned around and quickly ran for the back door.Fwoosh\u2014\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201dYuWon grabbed the back of the young man\u2019s, Mu WoonCheon\u2019s, neck.While getting pulled back, WoonCheon swung his hand.The small knife that was in his hand grazed YuWon\u2019s cheek.Ssk\u2014Crash\u2014\u201cKugh!\u201dWoonCheon\u2019s body was slammed into the floor, denting the ground and shaking the whole store.\u201cDamn\u2014it\u2026!\u201dWoonCheon wiggled around, trying to escape YuWon\u2019s grasp. But the only thing he could do was struggle. There was no way to escape YuWon\u2019s hold.\u2018H-How is he so strong\u2026?!\u2019He was being pushed down with excessive force. However, what terrified him the most was that if YuWon squeezed just a bit harder, his bones could be crushed.This all happened in an instant.Hargaan was confused about what was going on, so he asked YuWon, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cThis is the guy.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cAlias Cheon NamWoon. His real name is Mu WoonCheon. He\u2019s a player from the martial realm that gave up on climbing the Tower,\u201d YuWon said while looking down at WoonCheon. \u201cThis guy\u2019s the King of the Jackals.\u201d___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 35YuWon restrained WoonCheon with a durable rope.Though he might have been a 1st Floor player, he was still quite skilled. So YuWon had purchased a pretty durable rope from the Shop for this occasion.\u201cNgh\u2026\u201dWoonCheon lowered his head as he grunted. He guessed that it must have been a pretty expensive rope because no matter how much mana he used to power up, it did not give.Watching WoonCheon, YuWon raised his hand.Smack\u2014!\u201cUgh!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t look away. I know exactly what you\u2019re thinking.\u201d\u201cW-Why are you doing this to me?\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re Mu WoonCheon.\u201d\u201cYou got the wrong person. I s-swear.\u201d\u201cThen why did you try to run earlier?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because you had such a scary look in your eyes, I thought things might turn out like this\u2026\u201dWoonCheon trailed off as he lowered his head. He had a pure, innocent face, and he looked as if he was about to cry from being falsely accused.With a confused look on his face, Hargaan looked back and forth between the tied-up WoonCheon and YuWon.\u201cHold up.\u201dHargaan called YuWon to come to the back. Once YuWon had gotten close enough to him, he whispered a question.\u201cYou sure this is the guy you were looking for?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m certain.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so sure? He really could have run because he was spooked.\u201d\u201cRunning away just because you heard a name? Doesn\u2019t that seem odd to you?\u201d\u201cBut saying that he\u2019s the King of the Jackals just from that is\u2026\u201d\u201cThis.\u201dYuWon picked up and waved the small dagger that was sticking up from the floor. It was the weapon WoonCheon had thrown at YuWon.\u201cDoes this look like a normal knife?\u201d\u201cWhat is it then?\u201d\u201cLook closely at the floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dHargaan checked the place the dagger had been. At first, he didn\u2019t think anything was odd, but upon closer inspection, he found something strange.\u201cIt\u2019s melted\u2026\u201dHargaan originally thought that the knife had gotten impaled in the floor, but that was wrong. When the knife fell, it melted the marble until it looked like it had been impaled in it.And now that he thought about it, unless it was some real master-grade sword, it\u2019d be weird for a knife to be impaled in marble so deeply just by falling on it.\u201cThis is a pretty potent poison. It\u2019s something that players on the upper floors would use, not a 1st Floor player.\u201dA lethal poison from the upper floors. It was a substance that was illegal to use on fellow players. Not only did it require permission from the bureau to possess, it was also incredibly hard to obtain it.\u201cDo you really think the owner of a general store would own something like this? Always hidden in his sleeves, no less?\u201dThere were definitely a few oddities. That meant\u2026\u201cWhere did the information leak from?\u201d a random voice said.Actually, it was WoonCheon\u2019s voice, but his voice had become scratchier, and his manner of speech sounded much more foreign.And it wasn\u2019t just his voice\u2026Kk-crack\u2014WoonCheon\u2019s face slowly started morphing. On the kind-looking young man\u2019s face, wrinkles started appearing, and his eyes started looking much hazier. It was as if he had suddenly aged.\u201c\u2026 So you were right.\u201dHargaan now fully believed YuWon. This guy was Mu WoonCheon, the King of the Jackals.\u201cHow did you discover my identity? And more importantly, how did you learn my name?\u201d\u201cI wonder. How did I find out?\u201dYuWon smiled back in response to WoonCheon\u2019s question, mockingly responding to his question with a question.This made WoonCheon grind his teeth and glare at YuWon.\u201cYou apparently have no fear. Do you not know who\u2019s backing me\u2026?\u201dWoonCheon\u2019s eyes turned to Hargaan, and he was shocked.\u201cThat hair and eye color\u2026\u201dGolden yellow hair and eyes. It was an uncommon appearance.\u201cHargaan?\u201dHe knew Hargaan\u2019s name. It wasn\u2019t all that strange that he knew. Hargaan was the son of Zeus, and he was a rookie that made quite a name for himself during this Tutorial. However, that wasn\u2019t the only reason why he knew who Hargaan was\u2026Tap\u2014YuWon lightly hit Hargaan\u2019s side from an angle that WoonCheon couldn\u2019t see. Hargaan tried to gauge YuWon\u2019s action, and then he remembered what he had told him before coming in here.\u201cMake sure you respond properly.\u201d\u2018Respond\u2026\u2019 Hargaan wondered, \u2018Is this what YuWon meant?\u2019Hargaan raised his hand up high. And in a second, electricity started gathering in his hand.Spark, vzzzzt\u2014!An electric attack, which radiated intense heat, formed in Hargaan\u2019s hand.After witnessing that, WoonCheon started mumbling, \u201c\u2026 So it\u2019s true.\u201d There was rage in WoonCheon\u2019s voice. \u201cDid Olympus betray us?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hargaan was surprised by the unexpected question.\u201cSaying you were betrayed. That\u2019s kind of harsh.\u201d YuWon responded as if his feelings were actually hurt.Hargaan turned his head and stared at YuWon. Meanwhile, YuWon walked towards WoonCheon in order to hide the look on Hargaan\u2019s face.\u201cWe simply have a favor we want to ask.\u201d\u201cA favor?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re currently following Agamemnon\u2019s orders, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. So?\u201dWoonCheon\u2019s answer made Hargaan\u2019s expression turn sour.Agamemnon. Hargaan wondered why that bastard had a connection to Jackals.The confusion was hard for Hargaan to shake off. But before he could snap out of it, YuWon continued on.\u201cFor a little while now, the Ruler of the Skies seems to have an interest in the matters of the 1st Floor.\u201d\u201cThe Ruler of the Skies\u2026 does?\u201d\u201cYeah. And right on cue, his son has just finished the Tutorial.\u201dWoonCheon, who had a bitter face from thinking he was betrayed, now looked like he was filled with hope and expectations.\u201cHow much longer do you plan on acting as Agamemnon\u2019s dog here on the 1st Floor? He doesn\u2019t even serve one of the \u2018Big Three,\u2019 but a greenhorn that just became a High Ranker.\u201d\u201cW-Well, that\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cIf all this goes well, the Ruler of the Skies will start personally looking after you Jackals. And if you continue to do well, you guys might even obtain an important role in Olympus.\u201d\u201cAn important role\u2026?\u201dWoonCheon looked sold. The Ruler of the Skies had taken an interest in him. It was a far bigger deal than receiving orders from just Agamenon, one of Ares\u2019s lackeys.The Ruler of the Skies. The King of Olympus. Zeus.Being in his good graces would mean that he would have nothing to fear in this Tower. WoonCheon nodded his head, having forged his resolve.\u201cWhat\u2026 is the favor, sir?\u201dWoonCheon started speaking more humbly. It was as if he fully trusted YuWon\u2019s words, which was inevitable. He\u2019d been following Olympus\u2019s orders up till now, and after seeing Hargaan\u2019s electric attack, there was no way he wouldn\u2019t believe YuWon.\u201cHow many Jackals are there?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s about a thousand of them.\u201d\u201cGather them all by tomorrow night. Here\u2019s the location.\u201dYuWon took out a folded piece of paper from his pocket and tossed it to him.\u201cHave them all there by midnight.\u201d\u201cMidnight\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let Agamemnon or any of the guys on Ares\u2019s side know. You can do that, right?\u201dWoonCheon nodded his head aggressively.Tak\u2014YuWon tapped WoonCheon\u2019s shoulder before turning around.Hargaan and YuWon promptly left the store together, and Hargaan started growling at YuWon, \u201cYou sure are good at name-dropping someone else\u2019s father.\u201dHe turned his head and saw that Hargaan was genuinely pissed. It was honestly a wonder how he managed to hold his anger back.\u201cExplain yourself, and don\u2019t leave a single detail out.\u201dHis voice sounded like a growling beast.Spark, spark\u2014Because of how furious he was, a bit of electricity flowed out of Hargaan\u2019s body. If he actually exploded in anger, this whole area would probably be blown to smithereens.YuWon fully turned around and looked Hargaan directly in the eyes. He could tell that Hargaan was angry, but he wasn\u2019t the target of his anger.\u2018He did a good job holding it back.\u2019YuWon knew that it was probably hard for him to hold back after Olympus was mentioned. He was a more patient guy than YuWon had first assumed.\u201cIt\u2019s as you heard.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that Olympus is working together with the Jackals? You honestly expect me to believe that?\u201d\u201cAnd what if you don\u2019t believe it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way. He must just be selling out Olympus\u2019s name. Olympus is\u2014\u201d\u201cHargaan.\u201dYuWon stopped Hargaan.\u201cI don\u2019t know what kind of place you think Olympus is, but you need to take off your rose-tinted glasses\u2026\u201dStep\u2014YuWon turned around and started walking away.\u201c\u2026 And take a look at the true face of Olympus.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd like that, Hargaan was alone. He felt dazed.\u201c\u25b7 Just thinking about how much more work I have now because of those bastards makes me want to go pull out Zeus\u2019s beard right now.\u201dThe relationship between Olympus and the Tutorial\u2019s Administrator had soured. He had asked YuWon, but he avoided giving him an answer.\u201cDid Olympus betray us?\u201dHe remembered how the King of the Jackals mentioned Olympus\u2019s betrayal. It was something he would never have said if they didn\u2019t have some sort of connection to begin with.Hargaan\u2019s head ached, and he thought back to something YuWon had said.\u201cThe Olympus you know is probably a place that\u2019s righteous and uses its power to maintain order inside the Tower.\u201dThat should be correct. Olympus was a guild that used its power to maintain order inside the Tower. He was taught that he should not stand by misdeeds and judge others that committed them.Yet\u2026\u201cIf you want to know everyone\u2019s true colors, you should slowly uncover it yourself.

    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 36In a large cave\u2026\u201cWow. There was a place like this?\u201d\u201cIt is really big.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s damp and humid, and there\u2019s a weird smell\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was supposedly home of a Lizardmen tribe, though it\u2019s been a while since it was cleared out.\u201d\u201cAnyway, there sure are a lot of us.\u201dA bunch of people had gathered inside during the day. They were all players wearing white jackal masks, people who made a living by hunting 1st Floor players.\u201cThere\u2019s gotta be at least a thousand of us.\u201d\u201cThere were this many Jackals?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re so spread out, it can\u2019t be helped that we weren\u2019t aware.\u201d\u201cIs this the first time all of us gathered together in one place?\u201dJackals consisted of a network of small gangs, which meant that their presence was dispersed. Gathering together would defeat the purpose of their organizational structure, so it couldn\u2019t be helped that this was the first time they had all come together.\u201cI heard that that team over there obtained Floch\u2019s Viper.\u201d\u201cFloch\u2019s Viper? Doesn\u2019t that go for about 10,000 points?\u201d\u201cDamn. Our team got fucking nothing this time around\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, at least you guys got a few nice looking gals. I\u2019m sure they\u2019d fetch a pretty penny on the black market.\u201d\u201cHehe. That\u2019s true. If it weren\u2019t for the captain\u2026\u201d\u201cHey, shh.\u201dThe Jackals\u2019 chitchat suddenly died down. It was because of one Jackal that had just arrived at the cave.Step\u2014\u201cAre all of you here?\u201dIt was a Jackal wearing a red mask, the King of the Jackals. Mu WoonCheon had appeared.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cSo he\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is my first time seeing him in person.\u201d\u201cIs that really the guy, captain?\u201dThe Jackals who had never seen WoonCheon before asked each of their captains. The captains responded by simply nodding their heads.When the Jackal captains got down on one knee and bowed their heads, the others followed suit. It was a sight to behold, a thousand Jackals bowing to one person.WoonCheon smiled proudly behind his mask.\u201cEveryone, now rise.\u201d Having enjoyed the greeting, WoonCheon signaled the Jackals to stand up with his hands.And then the crowd started getting noisy.\u201cSo it really is him\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s never shown himself before, so why now?\u201d\u201cI heard he has a real bigshot backing him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not him that\u2019s being backed, but us.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how we were able to avoid the bureau till now\u2026\u201dThe cave had become noisy with chatter, and veins started bulging on WoonCheon\u2019s forehead. He didn\u2019t like this atmosphere.\u201cWhoever opens their mouth from this point\u2026\u201dShing\u2014!WoonCheon pulled out the sword that was hanging from his waist.\u201cI will cut off their head.\u201dEven inside the dimly lit cave, WoonCheon\u2019s sword shone brightly.The \u300cMoonlight Sword.\u300d It was an item far too pricey for any 1st Floor player to be wielding, but that weapon was in the hands of the King of Jackals right now.The Jackals quieted down.The captains also unsheathed their weapons and aimed them at the Jackals that were chattering, and the cave became dead silent in an instant.WoonCheon lowered his sword before continuing.\u201cWe have a mission to fulfill now.\u201d\u201cA mission?\u201d\u201cWhat mission\u2026?\u201dThe few that spoke out of reflex quickly covered their mouths because of the glares shot at them by the Jackal captains.After the small commotion ended, WoonCheon continued speaking, \u201cI don\u2019t know what the mission is. It will be a difficult one since it requires all of us, but I can tell you one thing for sure\u2026\u201dWoonCheon clenched both of his hands and raised them up above his head.\u201cAfter today, we Jackals will ascend to the sky.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201d\u201cWhoa, woooo\u2014!\u201d\u201cWoohooo\u2014!\u201dThe Jackals cheered at the short speech. Some were just going along with the crowd, but WoonCheon still smiled proudly.\u201cI shall introduce them to you.\u201dWoonCheon pointed towards the entrance of the cave.\u201cOur backers.\u201dTmp, tmp\u2014Two people entered the cave. They were both wearing the same red jackal mask as WoonCheon, which was the symbol of the King of the Jackals.Blonde hair and black hair poked out from each mask. It was Hargaan and YuWon.\u201cThank you for coming all the way here.\u201dWoonCheon bowed towards the two and then handed them a thick envelope.\u201cA small token for you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dYuWon reached out and took the envelope. Opening and inspecting the contents, he saw that there was a bundle of paper with \u20181,000\u2019 written on them. They were papers that had a special pattern engraved on them with a skill.\u201cIt\u2019s Asgardian currency, sir. Each bill is worth 1,000 points, and it\u2019s the result of the collections this time around.\u201dAsgard had created a unique currency of their own. They were purchasable with points and usable like real monetary bills. And since it was backed by Asgard, they were guaranteed their worth.\u201cAnd this is everything from the collections?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. That\u2019s everything.\u201dHargaan took a look inside the envelope after hearing WoonCheon\u2019s explanation.Each bill was worth 1,000 points, and the envelope was quite thick. It was at least a few hundred bills thick, meaning it was a total of hundreds of thousands of points. Even though Hargaan had grown up inside Olympus, he couldn\u2019t help but be shocked by the amount.\u2018So he\u2019s decided to completely jump ship,\u2019 YuWon thought.Seeing the amount, YuWon was sure that it was almost, if not all, of the money that the Jackals had made this time around. He knew that Agamemnon must have been waiting desperately for this money, so handing it over to him meant that WoonCheon had resolved himself to fully join YuWon\u2019s side.\u201cThanks for the gift,\u201d YuWon replied, as if it wasn\u2019t a big deal, putting the envelope inside his inventory.YuWon looked over the 1,000 Jackals that had gathered inside the cave. There was truly no other gang like them. They packed the cave full.While looking at them, YuWon smiled underneath his mask.\u201cWell then\u2026\u201dYuWon\u2019s hand slowly came up, and hot mana gathered at the tip of YuWon\u2019s fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s time to say goodbye.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Snap\u2014!YuWon lightly snapped his fingers.[Colossal Fire]Fshh\u2014!Fwooooosh\u2014!Starting right in front of YuWon, a massive fire started spreading across the cave.\u201cF-Fire!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cW-What is this?!\u201d\u201cIs this\u2014?!\u201dThe fire spread instantly. Red flames filled the cave in just moments, and a sharp-smelling smoke arose.Shocked, WoonCheon quickly put some distance between him and the duo.The cave descended into chaos.\u2018Could this be\u2026?\u2019WoonCheon thought back to the water that was covering the floor of the cave. He had assumed that the cave was just damp, but that wasn\u2019t the case. The water-like liquid on the ground was helping the fire spread even faster instead of putting it out. It wasn\u2019t water, but oil.\u2018But why didn\u2019t it smell\u2026?\u2019 WoonCheon wondered. Oil had a distinct smell.And then an item came to mind. \u2018The Scentless Powder!\u2019WoonCheon realized it. That item was capable of hiding the scent of the oil inside this cave. And it being a cave, it wasn\u2019t out of place for the floor to be wet.\u201cM-Move!\u201dThe nearby Jackals ran for the exit in an attempt to survive, but Hargaan\u2019s hands moved in reaction.Crash\u2014!Vzzzzzt\u2014!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThe Jackals that had tried to escape were knocked back. YuWon and Hargaan stood in front of the exit to stop them from getting out.WoonCheon looked back and forth between the Jackals that were burning alive and the duo. Everything had happened so quickly, he couldn\u2019t process what was happening.\u201cW-What in the world is going on\u2026?\u201dWoonCheon\u2019s eyes filled with rage.\u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what we\u2019re doing\u2019?\u201dYuWon took off his mask and tossed it aside.\u201cWe\u2019re cleaning up.\u201dCrush\u2014YuWon broke the mask with ease by stomping on it.Following YuWon, Hargaan also took off and tossed aside the stuffy mask.The two finally uncovered their faces, and WoonCheon finally understood that their goal wasn\u2019t to cooperate with them.\u201cYou guys\u2026 You\u2019re not from Olympus.\u201d\u201cWrong.\u201dSmash\u2014!Hargaan responded after punching away another Jackal.\u201cI am from Olympus.\u201d\u201cThen why?!\u201d\u201cBecause you guys are an embarrassment to Olympus.\u201dHargaan firmly planted his feet at the entrance of the cave.\u201cAnd I\u2019m going to cut you guys off with my very own hands.\u201dSlice\u2014Slash\u2014!YuWon also cut down the Jackals that ran towards him without any hesitation. He had no intention of letting a single one of them leave there alive to begin with.The entrance to the cave was the exit. There was no other escape route. That meant in order to escape from the fire, the Jackals had to get past Hargaan and YuWon to live.\u201cDamn it\u2026!\u201dWoonCheon took out his player kit in a hurry. There was only a single person that came to mind right now.Agamemnon.However\u2026[Message could not be delivered.]\u201cWhy?!\u201d WoonCheon shouted while attempting to resend the message over and over again, asking for help, for Agamemnon to come to his location as fast as possible. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it working?!\u201d\u201cA player kit is an object that sends a message by using the mana stored inside it,\u201d YuWon said, laughing at WoonCheon struggle so pathetically. \u201cDid you really think the player kit would work properly in the midst of a shitshow like this?\u201dThe player kit delivered messages by organizing mana into text. So the way to disable a player kit was quite simple. One just had to flood the surrounding area with mana, which was exactly what was happening. The fire skill created a wall of mana around the cave, so any mana message ended up disintegrating, unable to make it past the wall.Fwoosh\u2014As time went on, the fire got hotter instead of dying down.Over half the Jackals had already burned to death.\u201cW-What are you all doing?!\u201d WoonCheon shouted, pointing at YuWon and Hargaan. \u201cKill these bastards! Open a way already!\u201d WoonCheon shouted at the top of his lungs.It was a futile act. Even without him shouting as hard as he could, the Jackals were already running at the duo in order to live. And when they got close, they got their heads chopped off or were burnt to a crisp by an electric attack.Fwoosh\u2014And before they realized it, the fire had gotten awfully close to WoonCheon.\u201cUhh\u2014!\u201dBeing out of options, WoonCheon unsheathed his sword. In order to survive, he had to fight.\u201cHi-yah!\u201dWoonCheon ran forward while concentrating mana around his feet. He aimed for YuWon\u2019s side while he was distracted by taking down a Jackal.Fssh\u2014YuWon turned his head and the two locked eyes. His eyes were crimson.\u2018I-I can\u2019t move\u2026\u2019For a second, WoonCheon\u2019s body was petrified, like he had turned to stone.Slash\u2014Split\u2014Swinging his sword upward, YuWon sliced WoonCheon\u2019s body in half in one go, cutting from his crotch to his head.A red line appeared across WoonCheon\u2019s body. His head rang, and he could no longer think. It was as if time froze. Everything felt slow. And before he lost consciousness, locking eyes with YuWon, he was able to hear the very last words of his life.\u201cI\u2019ll put the money you gave me to good use.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 37Rumble\u2014Boom\u2014 Crash\u2014!The cave eventually collapsed from the fire.YuWon and Hargaan, who had been protecting the exit, ran outside in a hurry, getting far away from the cave.\u201cPhew\u2014\u201dHargaan, who had been fighting with everything he had for hours, let out a deep breath before flopping down onto the ground.Luckily, YuWon saw no injuries on Hargaan. Despite the long battle, it seemed like he had only run out of mana and wasn\u2019t too worn out.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cDo you think I would be?\u201d Hargaan replied, looking up at YuWon.Unlike him, YuWon didn\u2019t look tired at all. He still looked fully geared to go. Hargaan noted how YuWon didn\u2019t only have great skills, but also incredible stamina.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cWe killed a thousand people.\u201dYuWon looked down at Hargaan, who was sitting on the ground. At first, YuWon thought that he had sat down because he was tired, but it turned out that it was from guilt.\u2018This is probably the first time he\u2019s killed this many people,\u2019 thought YuWon.Hargaan had never experienced war, so obviously he wasn\u2019t used to killing people\u2014even bastards who deserved to die, like the Jackals.YuWon nodded his head to Hargaan\u2019s question. \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so nonchalant?\u201d\u201cMurder, kidnapping, robbery, slavery. Those were the primary ways the Jackals made money.\u201dJackals were a troublesome matter for the 1st Floor. They hunted new players and other small groups of players, taking their items and robbing them of their lives. And male or female, any good-looking players were kidnapped and sold off to a slave merchant. The organization was a pestilence.\u201cI can save dozens, even hundreds, of people by killing one of them. Why should I hesitate in taking them down?\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIt might be more convenient for you if you wallow in half-baked guilt.\u201dHargaan bit and closed his lips from YuWon\u2019s words. He looked as if he was hit on the head.After staying still, dazed, Hargaan shook his head and got up from his spot.\u201cI learned something from this event.\u201d\u201cWhat would that be?\u201d\u201cYou have a sharper tongue than your looks suggest, and you\u2019re pretty smart to boot.\u201d\u201cIs that supposed to be a compliment?\u201d\u201cYeah, it is.\u201dYuWon looked at Hargaan, who was now smirking. YuWon had thought this before, but Hargaan had great mental fortitude. The guy was filled with guilt and regret until just a second ago, and now he was looking better after just a short exchange.\u201cYou really are a just guy. Perfect for living an exhausting life.\u201d\u201cWell you didn\u2019t seem like a kind person, but turns out, you\u2019re different from how you look.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018different\u2019?\u201d\u201cEven though you had nothing to gain, you went ahead and took care of the Jackals. That wasn\u2019t an easy thing to do. It was the same during the Tutorial. You seem to always act with a much bigger picture in mind than me.\u201dThe way Hargaan looked at YuWon had changed.\u201cFrom when I was young, I was told that that\u2019s called a \u2018great cause.\u2019\u201dA \u2018great cause.\u2019 It was something quite embarrassing to hear.After hearing that, YuWon burst out into laughter.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong about one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat am I wrong about?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what you meant by \u2018there was nothing to gain.\u2019\u201dRustle\u2014YuWon shook a thick paper envelope in his hand.\u201cJust look at how much there was to gain.\u201dHargaan\u2019s eyes widened after seeing the envelope. He had completely forgotten about it. Inside the envelope were the points the Jackals had made from selling items stolen from the most recent Tutorial on the black market.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cYou wanna split it? You did help out.\u201d\u201cNgh\u2026\u201dHargaan lowered his head, grunting at the difficult decision. He then slowly looked up at the envelope in YuWon\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026 Give me some,\u201d Hargaan mumbled quietly.\u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201dAfter seeing YuWon\u2019s smirk, Hargaan lowered his head even further.The points that the Jackals had collected were gathered by killing and robbing new players. Though there were no owners to return the money to, Hargaan couldn\u2019t take it with a clear conscience.While opening the envelope to count the money, YuWon paused.\u201cOh, I have something I want to ask you.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou were second to me, right? In the Tutorial.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201dHargaan titled his head, curious why YuWon was asking him this.After a momentary pause, YuWon asked him, \u201cWhat was the reward?\u201d* * *\u201cWhyyy?!\u201dSlam\u2014!The corner of the table broke off. All the food and drinks fell to the floor, and in an instant, the restaurant became dead silent.After slamming his fist down because he couldn\u2019t hold back his anger, Agamemnon lowered his voice before asking, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I contact him?\u201dHe was at a pub late at night, and what he was about to talk about was something that he couldn\u2019t discuss while yelling at the top of his lungs in public.\u201cI-I\u2019m not sure either. I definitely tried contacting them, but\u2026\u201d\u201cDid WoonCheon go crazy or something?\u201cSince we sent him a message, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get a response soon, sir.\u201d\u201cAnd what I want to know is\u2026!\u201d Agamemnon bit his lip while starting to raise his voice again. He somehow managed to reign his anger in before asking his subordinates with eyes full of fury, \u201c\u2026 When exactly that is going to be.\u201d\u201cI-I\u2019m not sure about that, sir\u2026\u201d\u201cUnless he\u2019s really gone off the deep end, there\u2019s no way that bastard would have run off with our money\u2026\u201dThe money that the Jackals gave Olympus was a significant sum. It only ever happened once after every Tutorial, but they brought in anywhere from hundreds of thousands to\u00a0 sometimes millions of points.That amount of points greatly affected the Ares faction\u2019s financial power, and it was one of the major reasons why Agamemnon resided on the 1st Floor.\u201cHave you tried searching for any traces of him? Has he met anyone? Did he go anywhere?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re already searching for not just Mu WoonCheon, but any traces of Jackals using our network. I\u2019m sure we can find him before the night is over, sir.\u201d\u201cFind him no matter what. If we can\u2019t, it\u2019ll be the end for you, me, all of us.\u201dAfter growling, Agamemnon poured himself another drink.He was capable of getting rid of the buzz with mana, but at the moment, he couldn\u2019t hold back his anger without being drunk.A few hours passed.\u201cS-Sir Agamemnon!\u201dOne of Agamemnon\u2019s men rushed inside the pub in a hurry.From his subordinate\u2019s reaction, Agamemnon\u2019s face brightened. He thought that maybe they had managed to find WoonCheon.\u201cDid you find him?\u201d\u201cW-We did, but\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201dThe subordinate gave him a weird response.Agamemnon quickly expelled the buzz by evoking his mana.His subordinate tried to dodge his gaze as he pulled out his player kit.

And YuWon didn\u2019t want to get caught up in something so complicated quite yet on the 1st Floor.\u2018With this money, I\u2019ll be able to buy the core materials needed to make the item that\u2019ll hold the Dark Divine Crystal, but I still don\u2019t have enough to buy the materials for the fine detailing\u2026\u2019YuWon couldn\u2019t hold back his smile at the mountain of points he had amassed.\u2018Still, I might be able to finish the production of the item sooner than I expected.\u2019The \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d was currently the highest-ranking item YuWon possessed. As an item that symbolized \u201cthe Big Three\u201d gods of Olympus, it was one of the strongest items that YuWon knew to exist.Though it was currently only capable of [Stealth] and changing the attribute of the mana\u2026\u2018The fragment of the Helm of Invisibility\u2019s true power isn\u2019t either of those.\u2019YuWon knew that the fragment was currently slowly taking shape to show its true worth under the greatest blacksmith within the Tower.\u201cThe problem is\u2026\u201dWhile laying down on the bed, YuWon put his hand inside his inventory and pulled out the egg the size of a fist. It was pure white with an irregular purple pattern.[?\u2019s Egg]\u15cc It is ?\u2019s egg. There is no way to know whose egg it is, what will come out of the egg, or how to make it hatch.\u15cc Incubation rate : 0.00%It was truly a puzzling item.\u2018I can\u2019t figure out what this item\u2019s for.\u2019There were quite a few items with unclear descriptions. They were typically incomplete items, but that\u2019s because they were only half-made.Even YuWon, who had a myriad of different magical experiences within the Tower, had never seen an item in the form of an egg with this kind of description before.\u2018This egg is a reward from the Tutorial, and it\u2019s a reward for having achieved the highest record ever.\u2019YuWon rolled it in his hands while observing it.\u2018Hargaan got the King\u2019s Lightning Glove. It\u2019s a pretty advanced item used by Rankers. Using that as a reference, this can\u2019t be a normal item\u2026\u2019It had to be an item that was comparable to the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d And considering that the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d was given for defeating the Chimera Creator, \u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d was likely to be an even better item since it was a reward for achieving over 670,000cp during the Tutorial.\u201c\u2026 But I just can\u2019t figure it out.\u201dYuWon scratched his head in confusion.It was only the size of a fist, and it was an egg of an unknown creature with an irregular purple pattern\u2026\u2018The pattern!\u2019YuWon jolted up from his bed. He felt a faint warmth from the egg, and now that he thought about it, this pattern wasn\u2019t there when he had first checked the egg.Wince\u2014His head ached. A nightmare-like memory, one he didn\u2019t wish to remember, came to his mind. But now that he had remembered it, the memory sped through his thoughts like a high-resolution video.It was an event from the not-so-long-ago past. But it was also an event potentially far in the future. That was when YuwWon had seen an irregular pattern like this.\u201cAn Outer God\u2026\u201dWhen YuWon mumbled those words\u2026[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d greets you.]The egg spoke to him.Fshh\u2014YuWon\u2019s eyes morphed to a crimson color as he stared at the egg in the palm of his hand.\u201cYou\u2026 What are you?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 38Why didn\u2019t he think of it sooner? Why didn\u2019t he notice it earlier?For the next few days, the mysterious egg continued to occupy his thoughts.\u2018Is it really the symbol of an Outer God?\u2019YuWon couldn\u2019t sense anything. He started thinking maybe it was his imagination. For the Tutorial\u2019s reward to be related to the Outer Gods\u2026 Not once did he nor any of his comrades ever think of this possibility.\u2018There\u2019s no way to be certain yet.\u2019Tmp, tmp\u2014YuWon went outside for a walk.\u2018But if it\u2019s true\u2026\u2019Would the thing that hatches from this egg be a valuable companion that helps YuWon\u2026? Or would it bring destruction and ruin like the Outer Gods in his memories?YuWon shook his head. He was thinking too much.There was nothing he could do right now. He couldn\u2019t just throw away the egg, nor did he know how to hatch it at the moment either.What he needed was time.\u201cWhat a stupid, ridiculous gamble.\u201dYuWon let out a baffled laugh.The egg of an Outer God?Most creatures that hatched from eggs recognized the being that was with them the longest during incubation and the one they saw for the first time after they hatched as their mother. That\u2019s why some Rankers went through the trouble of obtaining eggs of mythical beasts to have them as companions. If they raised them right, a mythical beast could become a powerful ally.\u2018If I can properly hatch and raise this egg\u2026\u2019YuWon stopped his train of thought, shaking his head.\u2018Let\u2019s stop dwelling on it.\u2019Overthinking things was a taboo. Right now, he had to focus on the object in front of him.Tshhhhh\u2014YuWon entered Vulcaro\u2019s workshop.\u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cWait just a minute.\u201dFwoosh\u2014Vulcaro didn\u2019t even bother turning his head to see his guest. He put the crystal in fire and started refining it with a knife. The crystal slowly started changing shape after it was blasted with intense heat.\u2018It must be unbelievably hard.\u2019This was the first time YuWon was witnessing the refinement process for a fragment of \u201cthe Big Three.\u201dNormal refinement of crystals was done by slowly chipping away at them with a knife, but the fragment of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d couldn\u2019t even be scratched without first being submerged in fire.Vulcaro carried on with the refinement.Some amount of time passed.\u201cNgh.\u201dVulcaro stretched his back before submerging the fragment in water.Tsssssh\u2014The hot fragment instantly evaporated dozens of liters of water, filling the workshop with steam.\u201cSo you\u2019re here.\u201dVulcaro wiped the beads of sweat on his forehead with a towel as he walked over to YuWon.The two sat down on wooden chairs facing each other.\u201cYes. You told me to come over.\u201d\u201cI have something to ask you.\u201d\u201cSomething to ask?\u201d\u201cWhat type of weapons and armor do you use? If you use a sword, what type of sword is it? Is it long and thick? What kind of armor do you prefer? How light or heavy\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy do you ask?\u201d\u201cI ended up with by-products from the Crystal,\u201d Vulcaro answered as he pulled out a small bottle with black powder held inside. \u201cI want to try making something with this.\u201dPowder that came from refining the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d There wasn\u2019t a lot of it, but its value couldn\u2019t be underestimated. As the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d held such great powers, this powder was more valuable than most crystals.YuWon had no reason to refuse an item made from the Crystal\u2019s by-product.\u2018Hades\u2019s Scythe was made from the powder that came out while refining the fragment, but\u2026\u2019\u201cDon\u2019t you need other materials?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t easy to obtain materials that could support the power of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d And knowing Vulcaro\u2019s personality, he wouldn\u2019t want to use this kind of material to make some half-assed item. However, YuWon didn\u2019t possess any materials of that caliber yet.\u201cI don\u2019t have any materials like adamantium, but I do have something similar. Since it\u2019s not the refined Crystal, mythril should be enough to handle the powder.\u201d\u201cMythril\u2026?\u201d\u201cI have some on hand.\u201dThunk\u2014Vulcaro got up quickly from his chair, knocking it over. He then walked over and grabbed rebar off the wall. It should have been pretty hot from the heat inside the workshop, but Vulcaro held it unphased.\u201cIt\u2019s about 1.8kg.* It\u2019s not that much, but it\u2019s enough to make equipment by mixing it.\u201d*PR/N: 4lbsMythril wasn\u2019t that hard of a material, but it was a rare mineral that possessed great mana conductivity, and depending on how it was crafted, it could even gain mana resistance.Inside the Tower, mythril was considered a pretty rare mineral. With just about half a kilogram, you could mix it with metal to make a pretty decent item. Yet here was Vulcaro, casually owning 1.8 kilograms worth.\u201c1.8kg of mythril\u2026 That should fetch quite a price.\u201dYuWon currently had over 100,000 points, but that was nowhere near enough for 1.8kg. At the very least, he\u2019d have to pay 300,000 points.\u2018I could pay for it if I exchanged the Asgardian bills for points, but\u2026\u2019Counting the points that YuWon took from the Jackals, he currently possessed a total of 500,000 points. However, there was no way for him to currently exchange that many Asgardian bills into points.\u2018I guess I can only buy only a third of it.\u2019While YuWon was weighing his options\u2026\u201cYou can give me the money later. I\u2019ll put it on your tab.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll put it on my tab?\u201dIt was a shocking offer. He was offering to put hundreds of thousands of points worth of mythril on a tab for a new player that had just arrived on the 1st Floor.\u201cAnd what if I end up running away without paying?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my greed as a craftsman that makes me want to create a proper item with this. I\u2019m offering this to you because I\u2019m impatient. So if you end up taking the item and running away without paying, I won\u2019t hold a grudge against you.\u201d\u201cStill\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you really wanna get technical about it, the item that you left me with is dozens of times more valuable than this mythril. Actually, you can\u2019t even quantify the value of this item with points.\u201dUnsurprisingly, Vulcaro knew the true worth of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d And that\u2019s also why he had decided to trust YuWon with his mythril.\u201cYou trusted me for some reason, so it\u2019s only fair I do the same.\u201dTo put 300,000 points on a tab on a whim\u2026 YuWon had to hold back his grin. Vulcaro was still exactly as he remembered.\u201cLook over there and pick some equipment. If there\u2019s something you like, I\u2019ll start production based on it\u2026\u201d\u201cI need a sword.\u201dShing\u2014YuWon instantly pulled out a sword and handed it to Vulcaro with the handle facing towards the blacksmith.\u201cThe weight doesn\u2019t matter. As long as it\u2019s not so heavy that I can\u2019t wield it, I\u2019ll get used to it quickly. As for the shape and length, this is an adequate size.\u201d\u201cA sword you say\u2026\u201dVulcaro carefully inspected the sword YuWon handed him. It was the \u300cWell-Sharpened Sword\u300d YuWon had purchased in the Tutorial. It was a simple, no-frills sword that wasn\u2019t very difficult to make.Vulcaro smiled widely with a confident expression.\u201cThat\u2019s actually my speciality.\u201dIt was the first time he had smiled after meeting YuWon.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *A week later in the Olympus guild house located in the center of the city\u2026Clack\u2014In the large yard of the house, Agamemnon was putting on his heavy, silver-tinted armor. His subordinates helped secure it in place and brought him his sword.\u201cIs everyone here?\u201d\u201cYes, sir. We have gathered up all our players between the 1st and 10th Floors.\u201d\u201cHow many?\u201d\u201cAround 200, sir.\u201dAgamemnon nodded his head to his subordinate\u2019s reply.200 players. That was a number equivalent to most mid-sized guilds. It had taken a few days to gather that many men.\u201cAs long as we do this right, we should be able to get off the hook for failing to manage the Jackals properly,\u201d Agamemnon said with a resolute face. He then shook his head. \u201cNo, maybe even better. The Ruler of the Skies might even take notice of us.\u201dThe Ruler of the Skies. Hearing that name filled Agamemnon\u2019s men with hope. Even though they knew how dangerous the mission they were about to set forth on was, they were able to cover up their fear with anticipation.Agamemnon looked back at his men and smiled.\u2018To think this kind of opportunity would come to me.\u2019A few days ago, he had been in despair, having learned that the Jackals had been completely exterminated. He was about to completely lose his position within Olympus and get demoted to being an ordinary player.Thankfully, the will of the Tower hadn\u2019t abandoned him. No, instead it had presented him with an opportunity, similar to how players who made it through difficult trials were given great powers.\u201cWhere\u2019s the location?\u201d\u201cThe location is\u2026\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s eyes widened at his subordinate\u2019s answer. It was a completely unexpected location.\u201cNo wonder he wasn\u2019t found until now.\u201dHis subordinate nodded his head at Agamemnon\u2019s words.In order to find \u2018him,\u2019 they searched every corner of the 1st Floor for a long time, but they had been unable to find even a trace. It was only now that they were able to locate him.Agamemnon took his sword from his subordinate and fastened it to his waist.\u201cWhat about reinforcements?\u201d\u201cTaking the Administrator\u2019s intervention and the Tower\u2019s restrictions into account, a suitable reinforcement has just arrived.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dAgamemnon mounted his horse and braced himself to set out.\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s go.\u201dClop, clop\u2014Clop\u2014Olympus\u2019s army of hundreds of players, including Agamemnon, set out for their mission.* * *Slash\u2014!Thud\u2014A five-meter-long giant snake fell to the ground. With its belly sliced open, it twitched around, bleeding, until it went limp, the life extinguished from its eyes.[You gained EXP.][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 0.006%.]The completion rate slowly crawled up.YuWon swung his sword to get the blood off of it.On the ground, a relatively large, bloody mess of wolves and panthers laid dead. They were all prey that YuWon had hunted on the 1st Floor.For the past ten days, YuWon had focused on hunting. It was partly because he didn\u2019t want to just waste time while the refinement was being finished, and it was also to increase the [Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s] completion rate.\u2018I guess I really can\u2019t level up much on the 1st Floor.\u2019YuWon\u2019s hunting speed was incredibly fast, but there was a limit to the amount of EXP he could rack up on the 1st Floor. After a whole ten days of hunting, he was only able to level up once. It was an extremely stunted pace, but he couldn\u2019t get greedy and climb the Tower.\u2018In order to achieve a higher record, I need the refined fragment.\u2019So the only thing he could do right now was wait while increasing the [Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s] completion rate.As YuWon was about to continue hunting\u2026Ding\u2014\u2026 The player kit inside his pocket rang.Currently, there were only two people who knew YuWon\u2019s player number\u2014Hargaan and Vulcaro.YuWon sheathed his sword and checked his kit.The message\u2026[ Vulcaro : I finished the refinement.

He wondered if he had truly refined this crystal himself.The onyx-colored crystal radiated a mystical, darkness-like light. And despite it only being the size of a fingernail after being refined, light shone through its thousands of facets.Seeing that graceful light, Vulcaro couldn\u2019t help but put on a gentle smile. It truly was dazzling, so much so that one would never tire of looking at it.Vulcaro remembered having seen an alluring light like this before.\u2018I want to complete it.\u2019Vulcaro started to feel an overwhelming desire to create a fully finished product with this crystal. He wanted not just to refine it, but to create an item that could handle its full power. That was his greed as a blacksmith.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Vulcaro placed the crystal on a thick cloth, and wrapped it up.\u201cIt\u2019s probably impossible.\u201dShake, rattle\u2014Vulcaro raised his head. The equipment on the wall was vibrating ever so slightly.Grip\u2014Vulcaro grabbed the hammer he had placed off to the side. He gripped it differently than when he was forging equipment.He got up from his spot, limping as he walked outside.\u201c\u2026 It had to be today of all days.\u201dVulcaro had known this would eventually come, but he walked on thinking how great it would have been if he had been able to have just one more day.* * *Clack\u2014Stomp\u2014 Stomp\u2014Hundreds of players marched in rhythm.The slums were in chaos. People who made this place their home, unable to climb to the next floor, hid to protect themselves.\u201cWhat\u2019s all this?\u201d\u201cDid something happen around here?\u201dThe oncoming players were armed with swords and spears. And all of their clothes were decorated with the symbol of Olympus, a tall mountain.In front of this group, a player wrapped in red cloth walked alongside Agamemnon.\u201cTo be in such a foul-smelling place\u2026\u201d Agamemnon frowned at the awful stench that filled the slums. \u201cNo wonder we couldn\u2019t find him until now.\u201dAgamemnon stared at a building covered in tattered cloth. As he pointed his hand towards it, the hundreds of players behind him got into formation.The players surrounded the building, preparing their weapons.\u201cAnd you\u2019re certain this is the place?\u201d Agamemnon asked his subordinate, his voice filled with skepticism.The subordinate got close, nodding, his eyes having changed to a blue color. He answered, \u201cI am certain, sir.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Really?\u201dHis eyes spelled his doubts.Step-thump\u2014Hearing the sound of someone walking with a limp, Agamemnon smiled as he nodded.\u201cSo we are in the right place.\u201dThump\u2014A rough-looking, muscular man walked out of the cloth-covered entrance. Holding a hammer in one hand, the man wasn\u2019t wearing any proper equipment. And the hammer in his hand looked like a standard blacksmith\u2019s hammer.\u201cYou\u2019re causing a scene in the neighborhood. What brings you guys here?\u201d\u201cSurely that\u2019s a rhetorical question.\u201dShing\u2014Agamemnon pointed the tip of his sword at Vulcaro\u2019s neck.\u201cCriminal Hephaestus.\u201dAfter hearing Agamemnon, the players of Olympus that had surrounded the workshop started murmuring.\u201cHephaestus?\u201d\u201cThe blacksmith of Olympus?\u201d\u201cI heard he refused to make a weapon and ran off with the property of Olympus\u2026\u201dThere was a rumour going around that their mission was to capture Hephaestus alive. But once this was confirmed by Agamemnon, their faces changed in an instant.\u201cH-How are we supposed to capture a Ranker?\u201d\u201cNo matter how many people we have on our side\u2026\u201dHephaestus was the greatest blacksmith in Olympus\u2014no, in the entire Tower. And he was a Ranker that had climbed to the top of the Tower.Meanwhile, the people that Agamemnon had brought were players that hadn\u2019t even managed to clear the 10th Floor. Though they massively outnumbered him, there was a great difference in power.\u201cFear not. A Ranker\u2019s power is severely restricted on the 1st Floor.\u201d\u201cWhat? I ran off with their property?\u201dHephaestus let out a baffled laughter.Whirr, whirrrr\u2014Vulcaro, or rather, Hephaestus slammed the air with his hammer. The hammer struck against the thin air and created a massive sound blast, shaking the eardrums of the nearby players.It was a deafening boom. Hephaestus\u2019s powers made the entire place shake.\u201cNow stop making me laugh and come at me. I\u2019ll smash all of your heads.\u201dHis confidence made the surrounding players take a step back. They knew that if they were hit by that hammer, not just their heads, but their entire bodies would shatter.Despite this, Agamemnon laughed at Hephaestus\u2019s actions.\u201cYou\u2019re a Ranker that got crippled after being punished by the Ruler of the Skies. Can you really call yourself a Ranker while wearing almost nothing?\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s subordinate took a closer looking at Hephaestus\u2019s leg. Agamemnon was right. Hephaestus was disabled. Even when he was walking out of the workshop, he looked like he might fall over at any moment.\u201cBesides\u2026\u201dFlap\u2014Agamemnon gave a signal and the man wrapped in red came forward.\u201cWe also have a Ranker on our side.\u201dThe man had orange eyes, flaming red hair, and pure white skin. He was wrapped in a red cloth.\u201c\u2026 Chryses?\u201dHephaestus\u2019s eyes widened after recognizing the man.Chryses. He was a player that had climbed the Tower while being sponsored by the High Ranker Apollo. He was a rookie that was fairly well known in Olympus. Hephaestus had also seen him a few times.\u201cSo you\u2019ve become a Ranker.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d end up fighting against you.\u201dFwoosh\u2014Chryses stretched out his hand, forming a crimson spear.Hephaestus muttered to himself. He didn\u2019t expect that they would bring a Ranker from Olympus just to catch him.\u201cIf you guys cause a scene here with a Ranker on the 1st Floor, the penalty will be nothing to scoff at.\u201dPlayers of the upper floors had their powers restricted on the lower floors. And if they used too much power, even if it was restricted, a \u2018penalty\u2019 was applied to them. Worst case scenario, an Administrator would show up to personally intervene in the situation.\u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter. I might be a Ranker, but you\u2019re a Ranker as well.\u201dHephaestus frowned at Chryses\u2019s answer. Though he might be using his powers on the 1st Floor, it was directed at Hephaestus, another Ranker. So it was true that Chryses didn\u2019t have to worry much about the penalty.\u201cYou guys sure are good at coming up with sly tactics.\u201dFshhh\u2014Hephaestus\u2019s body started turning hot and\u00a0 red, and he started emitting a blue light from his eyes. His massive mana turned into heat, turning his vicinity into a sauna.Gulp\u2014The tension was thick.Fwoosh\u2014Hephaestus swung his hammer, finally speaking.\u201c\u2026 Come at me.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Boom, ka-boom\u2014!Fwoosh, boom\u2014!The hammer hit the air, and fire appeared all around Vulcaro.Players started dropping dead.

It was to the point that Chryses, who could manipulate fire, had to let go, unable to handle its sizzling heat.Shwoo\u2014Ting\u2014!Arrows and spears rained down, and Hephaestus knocked them away by swinging his hammer.Pshk, pshk, pshk\u2014!Chryses was impaled by the ricocheting arrows and spears.\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dHolding back his scream, Chryses slowly backed off.Woosh\u2014Smash, kk-crack\u2014!Hephaestus swung his hammer down in the direction opposite of Chryses.

It was the Tower\u2019s penalty.Though he was attacked first, they were players of a floor much lower than Hephaestus. Regardless of the circumstances, Hephaestus couldn\u2019t avoid the Tower\u2019s penalty being applied to him for attacking them.\u201cKgh\u2026\u201dHephaestus started wobbling. He already had a crippled leg, and now in addition to the penalty, he was having a hard time even standing.Chryses pulled out the arrows and spears that had impaled him before approaching Hephaestus once again.\u201cI had respected the part of you that, despite being a Ranker, could drop everything and give up on power for your own creed.\u201dThere was no aggression in his eyes, yet he once again wielded the flaming crimson spear in his hands.\u201cThat\u2019s why\u2026\u201d\u201cCut the crap.\u201dWhirr, whirr\u2014Hephaestus\u2019s hammer let out a cry. It was a vibration that shook the air.Chryses could instinctively feel that this attack was going to be the climax of this fight.\u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t want to fight against you.\u201dFwoosh\u2014Chryses enveloped his body with fire. It was enough heat to melt the ground.The entire area was filled with Chryses and Hephaestus\u2019s mana.The moment Hephaestus limped a single step toward Chryses\u2026Whoosh\u2014Chryses took the form of fire and charged at Hephaestus as if he was a chariot.Whirrrrrr\u2014Fwoooosh\u2014!It was a great collision of mana.\u201cG-Get away!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll get caught up in it!\u201dTheir collision burned all the nearby players into a crisp. Their fire attribute mana burnt the atmosphere into nothing.Gulp\u2014Agamemnon swallowed his spit.\u2018The result is\u2026\u2019Fsssh\u2014The flames started receding. As the heat and smoke started dispersing, the aftermath of their collision was revealed.Agamemnon smiled.Crack, kk-crack\u2014Hephaestus\u2019s arm was slowly turning gray, like stone.\u201cThat\u2026 shield\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something you made.\u201dFssh\u2014The fire subsided, revealing Chryses holding a steel shield with the head of Medusa on it.\u201cIt\u2019s Aegis. It might only be a replica, but it\u2019s enough to bind you.\u201dCrack, kk-crack\u2014Hephaestus\u2019s entire body had turned gray.\u300cAegis\u300d was Olympus\u2019s greatest binding item. Not only was it the greatest shield, but it also held the power of the monster Medusa. That\u2019s how the worn-out Hephaestus was able to be turned into stone.Thud\u2014As soon as he fully turned to stone, Hephaestus fell over on his side due to his crippled leg.Witnessing this sight, Agamemnon mumbled while trembling with joy, \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 finally over.\u201dThere were over a hundred fatalities, and Chryses received fatal injuries, but he was still satisfied with the results. Because he had managed to capture Hephaestus, the criminal.\u201cDrag him away.\u201dFollowing his order, his subordinates that had shied away from the battle approached the petrified Hephaestus.And that\u2019s when a voice interrupted them.\u201cI can\u2019t let you do that.\u201dSlash\u2014A player suddenly jumped in, and cut the feet off the subordinates that were approaching Hephaestus.Splatter\u2014!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dTheir ankles were cleanly cut.Agamemnon glared furiously as his subordinates cried in pain, rolling around on the ground.\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u201dThe reckless guy that jumped in the midst of a battle between two Rankers and hundreds of players\u2026Fwoosh\u2014\u201cWhat brings such wretched folks to an important place such as this?\u201dIt was the new player Kim YuWon.

    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 40It was when YuWon had just stepped foot into the slums.He was on his way to the workshop after getting the message from Vulcaro when he felt an ominous flow of mana.Boom\u2014!A sound could be heard in the distance\u2014the sound of Vulcaro swinging his hammer.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019For someone that was in hiding to suddenly use his powers\u2026 And then YuWon remembered.\u2018Could it be\u2026\u2019Vulcaro\u2019s real name was Hephaestus. He was an older Ranker of Olympus, as well as a blacksmith. However, after going against the will of Olympus, Zeus made him a cripple, and he started living in hiding on the 1st Floor.Yuwon remembered that there was one time where he was discovered by Olympus and dragged back.\u201cThat happened to be today of all days?\u201dFeeling rushed, YuWon imbued mana into his feet. He didn\u2019t have any speed enhancement skills, but he still ran at an impressive speed.Whoosh\u2014He jumped onto the rooftops, and he beelined towards where he felt the mana was radiating from.Ka-boom\u2014!Swoosh\u2014Hot air started blasting past him.Two manas of the same attribute had collided.YuWon stood in place, resisting the knockback of the blast from the collision.\u2018Is there a fight between Rankers going on?\u2019Hephaestus was a Ranker from thousands of years ago. Though he might have focused on his work as a blacksmith after becoming a Ranker and despite him being crippled, normal players would never be able to catch him.\u201cI guess they\u2019re not scared of the penalty.\u201dIf this kind of fight went on any longer, the Administrator might intervene. If that were to happen, Olympus would lose a great amount of the influence they exercised on the 1st Floor.So the fact that they took this risk meant that that was how much Olympus valued Hephaestus.Fshhh\u2014After withstanding the heat blast, Yuwon continued on.On top of a roof, Yuwon saw hundreds of players gathered around the entrance of the workshop, and in the midst of that crowd, he recognized two familiar faces.One was Agamemnon, who was smiling as he watched the smoke fade away, and the other was\u2026\u2018Chryses.\u2019\u2026 Chryses, who was wielding a shield in one hand, his body in tatters after fighting Hephaestus.\u2018That shield is\u2026\u2019YuWon used [Cinder Eyes] to check the item that Chryses was holding.A Medusa with her eyes closed. An item that could use Medusa\u2019s powers once a day\u2026 It was a replica of \u300cAegis.\u300d\u201cThen\u2026\u201dYuWon\u2019s face froze. As the heat and smoke dissipated, he spotted Hephaestus, who had become petrified.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Agamemnon\u2019s face relaxed. He didn\u2019t care about his subordinates that had just gotten their feet cut off. Instead, his eyes were still focused on Hephaestus.\u201cOh, so it was you.\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s nonchalant response made one of his subordinates, who was still fully tense, ask, \u201cDo you know him, sir?\u201d\u201cKim YuWon. He\u2019s a player that recently set a new record in the Tutorial,\u201d Agamemnon answered.\u201cA new record in the Tutorial\u2026\u201d\u201cDoes that mean he\u2019s a new player?\u201dAgamemnon\u2019s answer made all the other players nearby also relax their guard.\u201cI was worried for a second.\u201d\u201cI thought another Ranker had dropped by.\u201d\u201cHey, kid! Where do you think you\u2019re butting in?\u201d\u201cCome back after you drink more milk from your mommy!\u201d\u201cHahahaha!\u201dIn an instant, the tension shifted to mockery. Learning that the enemy that arrived at the scene was a new player and not a Ranker made the other players all laugh and jeer at him. That included Agamemnon as well.\u2018There\u2019s nothing that he can do by himself\u2026\u2019No matter how great of a performance he had in the Tutorial, he was still just a new player that had recently completed the Tutorial. Because of that, Agamemnon wasn\u2019t even a bit scared of Yuwon.However\u2026\u201c\u2026 What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d Agamemnon asked.Despite their mockery, Yuwon appeared neither angry nor afraid. He was surrounded by almost a hundred players and a Ranker, albeit an injured one, yet Yuwon didn\u2019t budge at all while standing next to the petrified Hephaestus.\u2018This guy, could he be\u2026?\u2019 Agamemnon thought.\u201cAre you planning on standing there and blocking our way until the petrification wears off?\u201d he asked.Yuwon didn\u2019t answer.Agamemnon took that as a yes.The other players, finally understanding the situation, stopped their laughter.Petrification. That was the effect of the replica \u300cAegis.\u300d However, because it wasn\u2019t the real deal, the effect of the petrification didn\u2019t last long, especially against an ancient Ranker like Hephaestus. Even if it was Chryses, a Ranker, that utilized the item, it was unknown how many more minutes the petrification would last.Tik-tok\u2014Suddenly, Agamemnon could hear a ticking noise inside his head. Though it was entirely his imagination, it was true that time was not on their side.If Hephaestus were to start moving again\u2026\u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d Agamemnon asked, raising his hand. \u201cKill him and bring Hephaestus here.\u201d\u201cB-But, if he\u2019s a new player\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d also receive a penalty\u2026\u201dHis subordinates hesitated. In response, Agamemnon pulled out his sword.Shing\u2014Slash\u2014!Agamemnon cut the head off the subordinate standing next to him. His head fell off, blood spraying everywhere. At the same time Agamemnon started bleeding from his arm.It was the penalty from murdering a lower floor player.\u201cWhat was that about a penalty?\u201dAgamemnon made it clear that he was ready to cut down everyone who didn\u2019t follow his orders.\u201cWhoever can kill him and bring back the criminal, I will give them a management position here on the 1st Floor.\u201d\u201cA management position\u2026?\u201d\u201cR-Really?\u201d\u201cJust for killing a single new player?\u201dTheir eyes filled with greed.They knew that they\u2019d receive a penalty for attacking a player from a floor lower than them, but Agamemnon\u2019s offer was too good to refuse.The players started charging in.\u201cAhhhhhhh\u2014!\u201d\u201cDie\u2014!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to kill him!\u201d\u201cNo, I will!\u201dEven players of the 10th Floor joined in on the attack.Agamemnon was sure that this would be resolved quickly. He thought that there was nothing a new player could do by himself in a battle like this.However, he soon realized that he was mistaken.Whirr, whirrrr\u2014\u2018Arcane Sword?\u2019 Agamemnon wondered.It was a hot, flaming [Arcane Sword.]YuWon cut down the players that charged at him with his sword imbued with fire attribute mana.Fwoosh\u2014!Slash\u2014!\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get caught in it!\u201d\u201cGet back!\u201dWith a single swing of his sword, he had shrouded himself and Hephaestus with fire attribute mana.The players who weren\u2019t able to evade it were burnt to cinders.\u201cKugh\u2026 What kind of a skill is that\u2026?\u201d\u201cHow is a new player already able to change the attribute of his mana\u2026?\u201dEncasing a sword with fire mana wasn\u2019t something that someone could do simply by possessing a fire attribute skill. To do that, one needed to first master a fire attribute skill, then have enough mana control to be able to change the mana\u2019s essence to hold shape around the sword.\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still just a new player\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dFwoosh\u2014!Shing\u2014 Pew\u2014!Countless swords, spears, and a myriad of skills descended on YuWon.He endured it by swinging his sword and unleashing [Colossal Fire.][The power of Colossal Fire is added to Basic Arcane Sword.]Shwoooo\u2014The attacks from nearly a hundred players was like a giant tsunami.In order to evade the attack from all the surrounding players, YuWon had no choice but to use all of the powers of [Cinder Eyes.][Cinder Eyes tries to find a way.][Cinder Eyes is resisting fire attribute mana.]The rare fire attacks were resisted by the power of [Cinder Eyes.] For YuWon who had previously endured Suruhtra\u2019s flames, a lower floor player\u2019s fire attribute attacks almost felt ticklish.Whirr, whirrrr\u2014YuWon sensed a turbulent flow of mana from behind him.\u2018Mana Blast,\u2019 YuWon realized.Swoosh\u2014YuWon quickly stretched out one hand in that direction.Whirr\u2014[Gigantification x Mana Blast]Fwoooosh\u2014!\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dYuWon\u2019s [Mana Blast] swallowed up the enemy\u2019s [Mana Blast.]The three players caught up in YuWon\u2019s [Mana Blast] were cooked alive.A short silence fell before the players went on an all-out attack against YuWon once again.\u201cDon\u2019t stop!\u201d\u201cKeep him on the ropes!\u201dKlang\u2014!Fwoosh, boom\u2014!It was a messy battlefield.Watching the scene unfold, Agamemnon\u2019s face froze. \u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 he thought.Slash\u2014!Another Olympus player\u2019s head was cut off.YuWon would not go down. Refusing to let them have Hephaestus, who was knocked over on the ground as a statue, he was a real persistent bastard.\u2018You\u2019re telling me that he\u2019s truly a new player?\u2019 Agamemnon wondered. He had heard that YuWon got first place in the Tutorial, surpassing Hargaan. He had also heard how he set a historic new record.Agamemnon thought that perhaps a new player that could one day stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the great rulers of this Tower, the High Rankers, had appeared. That was why Agamemnon didn\u2019t underestimate YuWon. Or at least, he thought that he hadn\u2019t underestimated him\u2026 The problem was that that still wasn\u2019t enough.Twitch\u2014Agememnon noticed Hephaestus\u2019s petrified body move slightly. It was a tiny movement, but he was sure.He couldn\u2019t drag this on any longer.\u201cYou useless bastards\u2026\u201dBut as he was about to jump into battle\u2026\u201cWait.\u201d\u2026 Someone stepped in front of Agamemnon.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of this.\u201d* * *Fsshh\u2014With his crimson vision, he was able to easily read the path of the sword being swung at him. YuWon was disappointed that this was what Olympus had to offer.\u2018So they don\u2019t know that numbers aren\u2019t everything.\u2019Wham\u2014!YuWon shifted his chest back, avoiding a sword swing before roundhouse kicking his opponent in the chest.\u201cKugh!\u201dHis opponent was knocked away. Players charged towards YuWon simultaneously from behind, left, and right.\u201c\u2026 Tch.\u201dFeeling annoyed, YuWon punched the ground.Then\u2026[Cinder Eyes takes control over Colossal Fire.][Colossal Fire \u2013 Fire Pillar]Fwoosh\u2014!Ka-boom\u2014!\u201cAhhh!\u201d\u201cDamn it\u2026.!\u201dA tall pillar of fire rose up around YuWon.One of the players who reacted too late ended up getting caught in the flames and was knocked away, and the other two players gave up on attacking and took a step back.YuWon maintained the fire pillar because buying time was enough for him.YuWon glanced over at Hephaestus, who was still petrified on the floor.\u201cHey, Ahjussi. How long are you planning on sleep\u2014?\u201dBefore he could finish his sentence, YuWon quickly turned his head, sensing an ominous flow of mana.Whoosh\u2014A big flaming spear pierced through the fire pillar.Ka-boom\u2014![Cinder Eyes is resisting Sun Shard.][\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d is resisting Sun Shard.]YuWon, who had been standing in place, took a step back.It was the first real fire he had experienced today.Ssk\u2014YuWon wiped away the ash on his face with the back of his hand.If it weren\u2019t for the fire resistance from [Cinder Eyes] and \u300cPyromancy Robe,\u300d he would have just been incapacitated.His burnt skin stung.\u2018Sun Shard, huh\u2026.\u2019YuWon looked over at the person who had just thrown that attack at him.\u2018So he finally decided to get off his ass.\u2019Orange eyes, red hair, and clothes tattered from the fight with Hephaestus.The lion that was laying low from being wounded, the Ranker Chryses stood in front of YuWon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 41Even injured, a Ranker was still a Ranker. Just by standing near him, YuWon felt like his entire body was going to go numb.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to laugh off the penalty.\u201dYuWon tried not to be hostile against Chryses. YuWon hoped that he wouldn\u2019t join the fight until Hephaestus woke up.The penalty of the Tower was much more powerful when a Ranker first laid hands on a player from the lower floor. It was different from Hephaestus, who had retaliated against players that attacked him first.\u201cI know.\u201dFssh\u2014Chryses endured the pressure that the Tower exerted on him. While cauterizing his open wounds with fire, he created another spear.\u201cWhat\u2019s your relation to Hephaestus?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a customer.\u201d\u201cA customer?\u201dHe wondered what YuWon was talking about, giving him a baffled look. A customer? Chryses figured that YuWon must have commissioned Hephaestus for an item or a repair. But he couldn\u2019t understand it\u2026 Why would someone butt into a battle of this scale over that kind of relation?YuWon exhaled a deep breath. He was trying to create some distance so other players wouldn\u2019t get caught up in Chryses\u2019s attack.\u2018The moment I let down my guard even a little bit, I\u2019ll be burnt to ashes.\u2019His opponent was a Ranker and the right-hand man of Apollo, the Ruler of Fire, no less. At this point in time, Chryses was still a fledgling that had just become a Ranker, but he was still not one to be underestimated.\u2018Let\u2019s take advantage of the penalty.\u2019YuWon knew that as long as he climbed the Tower, he\u2019d have to eventually fight against Olympus as well as Rankers. It just ended up happening much sooner than he had expected, but he knew not to panic.\u2018If I take his injuries and penalties into account\u2026 it should be no more than five.\u2019If Chryses could use all of his powers, this would be an impossible fight. But considering the injuries he obtained during his fight against Hephaestus, coupled with the penalty a Ranker faced attacking a player of the bottom floor\u2026\u2018I can do this.\u2019Luckily, it wasn\u2019t a bad match up. With [Cinder Eyes] and the \u300cPyromancy Robe,\u300d YuWon had a pretty high fire resistance. Plus, he had already experienced and survived Suruhtra\u2019s [Flames of Annihilation] during the Tutorial.This was also the 1st Floor. Chryses might have been a Ranker, but the restrictions of the Tower meant that he was a lot weaker.Crack, kk-crack\u2014YuWon\u2019s arm started to morph. Like a balloon being inflated, YuWon\u2019s right arm increased in size, enhanced by mana.Witnessing his transformation, Chryses and Agamemnon\u2019s eyes widened.[Gigantification]It was the most powerful skill that YuWon possessed, and it was also one of the skills that was a symbol of Olympus.\u201cSo he had quite the extraordinary skill.\u201d[Gigantification] was a skill that only Hercules possessed within Olympus. Countless Rankers had sought it out, but none of them were successful. That meant that [Gigantification] was an epic skill that even most Rankers didn\u2019t have.\u201cOne\u2026\u201dFwoosh\u2014The flaming spear within Chryses\u2019s grasp radiated intense heat.\u201cNo matter, he\u2019s still a new player that only just entered the Tower.\u201dFlash\u2014!A sun flew towards YuWon. Or at least that was what it appeared like.YuWon swung his giant hand forward with all his strength.Crash\u2014![Giantification combats against Sun Shard.][Cinder Eyes is resisting Sun Shard.][\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d is resisting Sun Shard.]Fwoosh, fwoosh\u2014[Gigantification] was a skill that had managed to break the armor and defenses of the Chimera Creator with ease. However, it wasn\u2019t enough to defend against a Ranker\u2019s attack with sheer physical strength.[You have failed to resist Sun Shard.][Status effect : Burn inflicted.]Sizzle\u2014YuWon\u2019s arm was cooked red. The pain from being burned was intense. He had somehow managed to block the attack, but he had failed to come out unscathed.\u2018Maybe I should have bought some Ice Crystals.\u2019YuWon wondered how things would have been had he consumed some \u300cIce Crystals,\u300d like when he fought against Suruhtra. Though he might have become a bit slower in movement due to the icy aura, he would have at least had higher fire resistance.Well, it was no use wondering about it now.Fwoosh\u2014Chyses\u2019s next attack was already incoming, hurling towards YuWon.Fwoosh\u2014!Shaaa\u2014The flames took the shape of a wave as it enclosed YuWon. It was actually closer to lava than fire, but it wasn\u2019t truly lava. It wasn\u2019t possible for Chryses to call forth lava while his powers were being restricted on the 1st Floor.Though, it might have been a different story for a High Ranker like Apollo.\u2018I can\u2019t seem to catch a break.\u2019Whirr, whirrrr\u2014YuWon created three [Mana Blasts] around him. The three Blasts took a ton of mana, and at YuWon\u2019s signal, they unleashed their power.Boom\u2014!The [Mana Blasts] collided with the crashing fire wave, but all they did was decrease the intensity of the wave\u2019s force.Whoosh\u2014!The flaming waves crashed directly into YuWon. He did his best to try and protect his body with his Gigantified arm and resisted the flames by strengthening [Cinder Eyes.][Cinder Eyes is resisting Sun Shard.][\u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d is resisting Sun Shard.][You have failed to resist Sun Shard.][Status effect : Burn increased to level 2.]A string of messages popped up.YuWon felt like he was being roasted alive. Hazy smoke came off his body, and he felt his legs weakening, making him wobble.The edges of the \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d started burning off. Even though it was an item with excellent fire resistance, it was going against a Ranker\u2019s flame.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 two\u2026\u201dSpark, crackle\u2014Yellow electricity started flowing across Chryses\u2019s body. It was the second stage of the penalty.YuWon wasn\u2019t the only one teetering from exhaustion. Chryses was also using all his strength to stay standing due to the injuries that were inflicted during his fight with Hephaestus.\u2018If I can just last a little longer\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought.He blinked once. It was just for a split second, and he thought he had plenty of distance between himself and Chryses. Yet\u2026Flick\u2014Chryes, who was wavering, disappeared into the fire, and\u2026Wham\u2014!\u201cKugh\u2026!\u201d\u2026 In a flash, Chryses closed the gap between them and punched YuWon straight in the chest.Crack\u2014YuWon heard his ribs breaking.Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the end.Ka-boom\u2014!An explosion occurred at the end of Chyses\u2019s fist, knocking YuWon up into the air.Whoosh\u2014Crash\u2014!YuWon\u2019s body flew through the air, slamming into a wall.The hard wall crumbled, and YuWon was buried underneath the rubble of the building.Crumble\u2014Thud, thu-thunk\u2014\u201cCough!\u201dPieces of the building trickled down and fell on top of YuWon\u2019s head.He slowly tried to move and winced at the pain in his chest.\u2018Maybe I underestimated him too much because we\u2019re on the 1st Floor.\u2019He might have just become a Ranker, but he was still a Ranker nonetheless. Even with the restrictions of the 1st Floor, the penalty, and his injuries, he wasn\u2019t an opponent YuWon could beat right now.With [Cinder Eyes,] the \u300cPyromancy Robe,\u300d and [Gigantification,] YuWon had thought that he would have been able to at least last until Hephaestus woke up.\u2018But that makes it three.\u2019\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dYuWon got back up while grunting in pain. His bones were broken, but he could still move.It was thanks to the additional stats he had gained from the [Heaven-Slaying Star,] the Strength and Constitution he gained from consuming \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart,\u300d and protecting his body with his Gigantified arm.\u2018Only about two more strikes left.\u2019YuWon pictured the rest of the fight in his head.\u2018For me to endure that\u2026\u2019In the end, YuWon knew he needed\u00a0that.Shine\u2014In the midst of the rubble of the collapsed building, a faint light entered his vision.YuWon looked around at his surroundings.

And when he did experience it, it wasn\u2019t for something like coming down to the 1st Floor and using his powers, so he\u2019d had no fear of the penalty.\u201cThe penalty? You\u2019ll know once you experience it first-hand.\u201dThat was what the God Apollo had told him after he had received his mission and was about to go down to the 1st Floor.\u201cYou\u2019ll understand how great a power flows inside this Tower.\u201dAt first, Chryses didn\u2019t really understand what he had meant. What kind of a power could make even Apollo, one of the strongest people in Olympus, admit its greatness?But now that he was experiencing it firsthand, he understood.\u2018I could perish.\u2019The penalty was different from any skills Chryses knew. He tried putting it into words\u2026\u2018Will.\u2019From the sensation of his existence perishing, Chryses felt something massive intervening.\u2018Is this the Tower\u2019s will to prevent beings on the upper floors from intervening too much?\u2019He was surprised. Chryses had presumed that the Tower was just a massive world to live in, but for it to actually have its own will like it was alive? And that \u2018will\u2019 was trying to extinguish him for exerting too much power in order to protect the ecosystem of the lower floors.\u201cBut with this, it\u2019s now over.\u201d\u201cThank you for your hard work, sir.\u201dAgamemnon approached Chryses and bowed his head.Without his help, this mission would have been impossible. It was Chryses who had captured Hephaestus with the replica \u300cAegis,\u300d and he was also the one who had defeated the new player that suddenly interfered. This was accomplished entirely through Chryses\u2019s help.\u201cQuickly transport the criminal! Check for fatalities and treat the wounded! Also\u2026\u201dAgamemnon looked towards the collapsed building where YuWon was buried.\u201cLet\u2019s just leave him be,\u201d Chryses interrupted Agamemnon.Shocked, Agamemnon looked back at him.\u201cPardon me, sir. In the future, he\u2019s sure to be\u2026\u201d\u201cThe mission is now over. We\u2019re the ones that broke the rule of the Tower by causing a ruckus. I\u2019d like to avoid unnecessary murder.\u201dAgamemnon bit his tongue at the firm response. At the end of the day, it was Chryses who was the one leading this mission.\u201cI understand, sir. Then\u2026\u201dBoom\u2014!From within the collapsed building, the rubble erupted, and a cloud of dust fanned out. And from within that mess, YuWon walked out, wielding a sword.A fire lit in Agamemnon\u2019s eyes once again.\u201cThis almost dead shitling is\u2026\u201d\u201cHalt,\u201d Chryses said.Agamemnon shouted back at Chryses, who seemed like he was trying to dissuade him once again, \u201cAre you saying we should still leave him be? He\u2019s clearly trying to fight us again!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dChryses shook his head. He hadn\u2019t stopped Agamemnon this time around because he wanted to avoid unnecessary killing.Crackle\u2014YuWon walked out from the cloud of dust.\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026\u201dVzzt\u2014!From within his hand, dark attribute mana, which was rare and uncommon, was endlessly overflowing.\u201c\u2026 Dangerous.\u201d[Pure Dark Divine Crystal]___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Chapter 42The workshop that Hephaestus had been using collapsed. Made by having done some adjustments to a small building in the slums, it was in a shabby state where it could have collapsed at any moment.YuWon took a punch from Chryses, which sent him flying into the workshop. And from within the rubble, he found the \u300cDark Divine Crystal,\u300d no, the now properly refined \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d and grasped it within his hand.\u201cWhat do you mean \u2018dangerous,\u2019 sir?\u201d Agamemnon asked Chryses, confused by his words.There was a hidden veil of annoyance on Agamemnon\u2019s face as he looked at Chryses. He wanted to capture Hephaestus as soon as possible and finish his mission, but things continued to get delayed.\u201cHe\u2019s almost dead. There\u2019s no reason to be afraid of him.\u201d\u201cDark attribute mana is a special case. And to consider him almost dead, though his mana is\u2014\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dHis patience finally hitting its limit, Agamemnon interrupted Chryses.\u201cNo matter how talented he might be, he\u2019s still a new player. You look very tired, sir. Please have some rest.\u201dAgamemnon set his sights back on YuWon.\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of him\u2026\u201dIt was the strangest thing. YuWon, who was standing in the pile of rubble just a moment ago, had disappeared.\u2018Where did he go\u2026?\u2019Boom\u2014!The sound of a loud explosion. It was from the direction where Hephaestus was laying on the ground.Surprised, Agamemnon quickly turned his head.\u201cKugh\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dWham, crash\u2014The subordinates that were sent to carry Hephaestus back were sent flying like bowling pins. It all happened in an instant, the battlefield erupting into absolute chaos once more.YuWon was once again standing next to Hephaestus.Agamemnon grit his teeth.\u201cWhat are you doing, you idiots?\u201d Agamemnon shouted in fury. \u201cAre you just going to watch him? Go kill him! I said I\u2019ll give a management position to whoever kills him! Now jump him all at once!\u201dHephaestus\u2019s petrified body continued to slowly twitch. The Petrification status effect only stopped one\u2019s movement. It didn\u2019t stop one\u2019s mind. That meant that even now, Hephaestus was struggling with everything he had to break out of the Petrification.\u201cL-Let\u2019s go all in together!\u201d\u201cAhhh!\u201dThough their individual skills weren\u2019t all that impressive, one couldn\u2019t ignore the strength in numbers.YuWon tightly gripped his sword, watching the wave of people charge at him. With a sword in one hand and the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d in the other, he unleashed his mana with all his strength.Flash\u2014!An instantaneous mana ripple.Shwoo, fwoosh\u2014Where the dark mana passed by, players\u2019 heads were cut off, and their arms and torsos withered away.Their wailing cries could be heard from the horde of players.YuWon continued to fight against the ones that rushed at him, bringing out the power of the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal.\u300dVzzt\u2014!Crash\u2014!With the fragment in YuWon\u2019s hand, his mana continuously changed attributes and was amplified.The only ones to notice the item were Chryses and Agamemnon.\u201cHe had an unbelievable item. Was that a reward from the Tutorial?\u201d Chryses remarked in amazement, watching YuWon fighting against dozens of players from floors above him. He then looked over at Agamemnon whose face had turned white. \u201cWhat did I tell you? Tsk, tsk.\u201dChryses\u2019s response ticked off Agamemnon. He grit his teeth. He didn\u2019t know what was going on. Until just a moment ago, he didn\u2019t seem like he had that kind of item at all.\u201cThe Tower called forth a monster.\u201d\u201cThis is no time to be impressed, sir!\u201dAgamemnon looked at Chryses with fire in his eyes, giving him a death glare.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Didn\u2019t you say earlier that you guys could take care of him yourselves?\u201d\u201cSo are you saying you won\u2019t do anything about this?\u201d\u201cFrom the beginning, my role was to stop Hephaestus in his tracks. Against a new player, according to the rules of the Tower, you guys need to resolve this on your own.\u201d\u201cAre you serious\u2026?!\u201dChryses smirked at Agamemnon\u2019s reaction. It wasn\u2019t that Chryses didn\u2019t understand how he was feeling. After losing the Jackals, if he failed to capture Hephaestus, who was incredibly difficult to find, he\u2019d completely lose ground in Olympus.\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Chryses said, standing up with a grunt. He clapped Agamemnon\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI intend on seeing things through.\u201dDrip\u2014A big drop of sweat fell down Chryses\u2019s forehead as he continued to walk. He had already reached his limits from suffering the penalty. He looked like he might fall over at any moment from how poor condition he was in.YuWon spotted the weakened Chryses. And at the same time, he flicked the finger of the hand that was holding the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d and waved his hand in the air.Crackle\u2014!Fwoosh\u2014The fire mixed with the dark mana, creating a black flame that enveloped YuWon.Seeing this made the players that were charging in take a step back.Step\u2014The only one who passed through the fire was Chryses. Seeming unphased by them, he reached out his hand and held some of YuWon\u2019s flames in his palm.\u201c\u2026 Amazing.\u201dFwoosh\u2014 Flicker\u2014Chryses remarked, while closely observing YuWon\u2019s fire in his hand.Fire and dark. It was already impressive that he was able to manipulate a single attribute, but YuWon was in fact able to control two attributes. Even most Rankers were incapable of this kind of mana control.\u201cDo you have any thoughts of joining Olympus? If equipment is what you\u2019re after, I promise to give you something far better than what you commissioned Hephaestus.\u201dYuWon shook his head.\u201cThere\u2019s no way that\u2019s my objective.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. You have a point.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ve already given him my answer to that question before.\u201dYuWon referred to Agamemnon, who was standing and watching from the sidelines.\u201cAnd of course you said \u2018no,\u2019 right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWhat a shame.\u201dHe knew that it was highly unlikely, but Chryses still asked for the slim chance of being able to recruit YuWon. Because YuWon was that desirable of a gem.Chryses\u2019s fire swallowed up YuWon\u2019s fire, and the black flames near him changed to red.The flames in the area were split in two\u2014half YuWon\u2019s dark flames and half Chryses\u2019s red flames. The two fought each other, crashing head on.While that was going on, Chryses body continued to be overloaded by the penalty.\u201cAre you sure you can keep fighting?\u201dChryses responded with a baffled laughter, \u201cI never thought I\u2019d hear that from a new player.\u201dThis was an embarrassing occasion he\u2019d never be able to tell another soul. However, that was only because other people didn\u2019t know about YuWon\u2019s existence.\u2018In about a hundred years, I might be able to share today\u2019s events with pride,\u2019 Chryses thought.A scenario came to Chryses\u2019s mind.\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve fought Kim YuWon before.\u201cNo, really. \u2018When?\u2019 you say? Well, it was right when he had just arrived on the 1st Floor\u2026\u201dChryses smirked as he shook his head. He found it funny that he was already thinking about sharing this tale with his friends in the distant future.Who could have ever imagined that a new player would be able to go toe-to-toe against a Ranker?\u2018Of course\u2026\u2019Fwoosh\u2014Chryses\u2019s flames swallowed up YuWon\u2019s flames.\u2018That\u2019s only possible if I manage to survive this first.\u2019Whoosh\u2014!All the nearby flames gathered around Chryses. The fire quickly swirled together until it formed the shape of a sun.Watching this attack, YuWon mumbled to himself, \u201c\u2026 So he\u2019s prepared to perish.\u201dYuWon got a sense of how truly important this mission was to them. Of course, that was why they were able to send down a Ranker to the 1st Floor equipped with \u300cAegis,\u300d even if it was a replica.\u2018If Ahjussi doesn\u2019t rejoin Olympus here\u2026\u2019Fshhhhh\u2014YuWon started putting more power into the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d in his grasp. Reacting to YuWon\u2019s mana, the Crystal wailed loudly. The resonating mana started to grow so much that YuWon\u2019s body couldn\u2019t handle it anymore.\u2018\u2026 The next Gigantomachy might not happen.\u2019To ensure that it didn\u2019t, YuWon had to protect Hephaestus right here, right now.The second Gigantomachy, that tragedy, could not be allowed to happen.Fwoosh\u2014Fshhh, shh\u2014The two massive energies were hostile to each other. The two different types of mana almost seemed like they were growling as they collided and created a windstorm.Step\u2014YuWon and Chryses simultaneously walked towards each other.The small sun that Chryses created started descending after he gave the signal with his hand.Vzzzt, vzzt\u2014Not accepting Chryses\u2019s action, the Tower forced a powerful penalty onto him.The small sun started to lose its form as it wobbled.Grit\u2014Having clenched his jaw as hard as he could, chipped teeth and blood sloshed around Chryses\u2019s mouth. Still, he gathered the remaining focus he had and recollected his mana into one point.Fwooo\u2014The flames came back together, and the small sun regained its shape.With the last of his mental fortitude, Chryses managed to endure the penalty of the Tower.And like that, two beings, one from the highest point in the Tower and the other from the lowest, collided.\u201cI knew it. You really are amazing.\u201dIn the midst of the giant collision of mana, Chryses was able to faintly hear YuWon\u2019s voice.\u2018He knew it\u2026?\u2019 Chryses wondered.Rumble\u2014!* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *A hot and violent windstorm brewed. Some of the nearby players even lost consciousness from the storm.\u2018What kind of a ridiculous situation is this\u2026?\u2019 Agamemnon thought.The entire world of the 1st Floor felt like it was howling due to the collision of mana against mana. And due to the aftershock of the penalty applied to Chryses, the surrounding area was already devastated.The windstorm continued for a while.Agamemnon\u2019s nerves were on edge.\u2018How did their battle go?\u2019Chryses could no longer fight. It\u2019d be a miracle if he didn\u2019t perish from this attack, let alone continue fighting. A Ranker exerting this much power on the 1st Floor was probably unprecedented in the Tower\u2019s history. Even if he didn\u2019t die, Chryses\u2019s body was probably worn out to the point where he\u2019d no longer be able to use any powers for some time.Fshhh\u2014The area looked distorted due to the heat. The haze created by the collision of the two flames slowly started to fade away.\u201cBoth of them\u2026 are alive.\u201dFrom within the haze, YuWon and Chryses could both be seen.\u201cBarely, but alive.\u201dIt was as Agamemnon said. They were technically \u201calive.\u201dYuWon and Chryses were passed out on the ground. One could see that Chryses was alive from the subtle trembling of his body. Compared to Chryses, YuWon didn\u2019t look as bad, but he was in a state where he could only slightly twitch his fingers.Their battle was a draw.Seeing the results, Agamemnon smiled.\u201cWe won\u2026\u201dThough it took a lot, YuWon had been taken down. Regardless of how strong he might have been, there was no way YuWon could do something while his body was completely torn up like this.As Agamemnon was confirming his victory\u2026\u201cYou won?\u201dKlang\u2014!He heard an ominous sound.Hoping it wasn\u2019t what he thought it was, he turned his head. And what he saw was\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet, kiddo.\u201d\u2026 A crippled man tightly gripping his hammer, his face contorted in fury.Hephaestus had finally been released from his Petrification.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Chapter 43Klang, boom\u2014!It was the sound of air being ripped apart.Hephaestus swung his hammer with ridiculous force. Every time he exerted power, the penalty accumulated in his body, but Hephaestus continued to relentlessly swing his hammer.It was a show of anger, and that anger wouldn\u2019t subside just from whacking the air a few times.\u201cU-Uhh\u2026\u201d\u201cH-He seems really mad.\u201d\u201cMy ears\u2026\u201dThe players that managed to survive the sonic boom of the hammer started retreating.Hephaestus\u2019s hammer was scarier than Agamemnon\u2019s sword. The pressure could crush their bodies if they took even a step closer.It was fear.Hephaestus\u2019s body continued to turn redder and redder. His mana made it feel like he was a gigantic being. He was physically demonstrating that he planned on ignoring the penalty, daring anyone to challenge him.The players knew that there was no way for Hephaestus, a Ranker, to directly attack them. If he indiscriminately murdered dozens of lower floor players, even he would be unable to take the penalty.So one of two scenarios were bound to happen. Either he\u2019d perish before he could kill all the players present, or an Administrator would show up. That meant that Hephaestus was currently just wasting his mana, swinging his hammer in the air.\u2018I could use that to my advantage then\u2026\u2019 Agamemnon thought.There was still a chance. Hephaestus wasn\u2019t at 100%, having just broken out of Petrification. So if he could just use the penalty\u2026That train of thought was interrupted by the sight of Hephaestus swinging the hammer in his direction.Whoosh\u2014Ka-boom\u2014!The attack struck the air with Agamemnon in its trajectory.\u201cKugh!\u201dThe blast from the hammer directly struck Agamemnon\u2019s body.Vzzt\u2014!A powerful electric shock flowed through Hephaestus\u2019s body from the penalty. Seeming unphased, Hephaestus stood calmly in his spot and swung his hammer onto his shoulder.Unlike the other players, Agamemnon was a player from a relatively high floor. So despite being the first one to attack, the penalty placed on Hephaestus was significantly smaller.\u201cI don\u2019t care about the other guys, but I am definitely going to kill you.\u201dTmp\u2014Fshhh\u2014\u201cCough, kugh\u2026\u201dAgamemnon stood back up, using one hand to push himself off the ground while blood dripped out of his mouth. Mixed in with the blood that he vomited out were pieces of his internal organs.Hephaestus walked closer to him, hot steam billowing off of his body.Penalty? It seemed he no longer cared about something like that.Hephaestus had completely lost his sense of reason. Either that or he knew that he wouldn\u2019t perish from just killing a single person like Agamemnon.While ignoring attacks from the other players, Hephaestus continued to stare solely at Agamemnon.Whoosh\u2014Hephaestus\u2019s hammer rose up into the sky.Agamemnon couldn\u2019t move because of the overwhelming pressure and mana. He couldn\u2019t believe he had tried to catch a behemoth like him.\u2018I-I\u2019m going to die\u2026\u2019 he thought.He knew these would be his final moments. Agamemnon shut his eyes tight as death approached him from head on.Klang\u2014!The heavy ringing of the hammer spread, vibrating the atmosphere.Agamemnon sensed his death\u2026 Or he thought he did.The result ended up being different.\u2018What just happened\u2026?\u2019At the absence of an impact, Agamemnon carefully opened his eyes.A large shadow covered his entire body.Someone had stepped in between him and Hephaestus.\u201c\u25b7You went too overboard.\u201dAgamemnon saw the side profile of an enormous man about three meters tall. With hands the size of a normal person\u2019s head, he had stopped Hephaestus\u2019s hammer.Except for Giants, there weren\u2019t many people who were that big and capable of stopping Hephaestus\u2019s hammer with just one hand. And the only person who could have appeared with this timing would be\u2026\u201cThe Administrator\u2026?\u201dEven before Agamemnon said it, Hephaestus had an inkling as to whom the gargantuan man that appeared in front of him might have been.The Administrator of the 1st Floor.It was honestly not strange for him to have appeared at this moment. In fact, his appearance seemed a bit late.\u201cWhy did you have to appear now of all times?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Did you think I\u2019d just stand by and watch forever, leaving you be?\u201dHearing Hephaestus\u2019s complaint, the Administrator took his hammer and tossed it behind him. After leaving Hephaestus\u2019s hand, the hammer fell with a loud thump, creating a deep crater in the ground.\u201c\u25b7 If you want a proper fight, do it up there, not here. This is the 1st Floor.\u201dThe Administrator almost never interfered outside of the test. They left most things to the players, Rankers, and guilds of the Tower. And usually when an Administrator interfered, it was because a problem occurred during a test.The exceptions to this were in the bottom floors. Administrators took special care of the 10th Floor and below, especially the 1st Floor.Still, normally guilds took charge and managed the floors, but right now a guild called \u2018Olympus\u2019 was causing problems. And since this was a problem that a guild couldn\u2019t resolve, it was only natural that the Administrator came out personally.\u201cI had no intention of fighting.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 That\u2019s good to hear.\u201dThe Administrator turned his head. Agamemnon locked eyes with the Administrator, and he saw something like the great expanse of the universe within his eyes.The Administrator. Just as the name implied, they were beings that ruled and managed the floors. They were beings that not only rivaled Ares, the person that Agamemnon served, but even Zeus, the King of Olympus.\u201c\u25b7 Are you a bastard from Olympus?\u201d\u201cY-Yes? I mean, yes! That\u2019s right, sir.\u201dSeeing Agamemnon stutter like an idiot, the Administrator thought how pathetic he was.\u201c\u25b7 Pass this on to Zeus. If he does something like this again, I\u2019ll come pull out his entire stupid beard again.\u201d\u201cY-Yes, sir\u2026\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Don\u2019t just say you will.\u201dThe Administrator stretched out his hand.Despite a giant hand coming towards him, Agamemnon couldn\u2019t avoid it. He felt that if he tried to dodge it, the Administrator\u2019s hand would immediately blow his head off.\u201c\u25b7 You will have to, no matter what.\u201dWhirr\u2014A black mark was imprinted on his forehead.Noticing the unique mark that resembled a tongue, Agamemnon rubbed his forehead.Hephaestus, familiar with the mark, broke out in laughter.\u201cKek, pfft\u2026\u201dIn the Tower, the orders of an Administrator were absolute. Still, the Administrator planted a mark on Agamemnon\u2019s head to be sure. If Agamemnon were to ever meet Zeus, he would relay exactly what the Administrator said, including the bit about pulling out his beard.Feeling helpless, Agamemnon looked back and forth between Hephaestus and the Administrator. What could he do between these two colossal beings?It didn\u2019t take much thinking. With the intervention of the Administrator, there was nothing they could do.This fight\u2026 was Olympus\u2019s loss.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *YuWon felt like this entire body had been scorched on a grill.It didn\u2019t take long for him to lose consciousness, though he did remember trying his best to not pass out.He faintly remembered what happened afterwards.[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d bares its fangs.]It was a ridiculous message. How could a creature that hasn\u2019t even hatched yet bare its fangs?For a while, the egg trembled inside his inventory, as if it really was about to fight.Gnaw\u2014The egg with a purple pattern. He thought he could see something like teeth. They weren\u2019t actually visible, but he was certain that they existed.\u2018This is dangerous,\u2019 YuWon thought. He felt goosebumps pop up, something he didn\u2019t feel even while directly facing a Ranker.What was this egg?YuWon got lost in fear and in thought.\u2018Was it trying to protect me?\u2019\u2018What was the purpose of the fangs that it revealed from inside its hard shell?\u2018Or was it trying to eat me while I was weakened?\u2019He didn\u2019t know the exact reason, but before he could find out, YuWon got another message.[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d returns to hibernation.]The egg that had been baring its fangs for a while fell back into slumber.This message wasn\u2019t something that had shown up while YuWon was passed out. It was a message that popped up just now.YuWon suddenly realized that he had regained consciousness.\u201cI\u2026\u201dHe wondered when he had passed out, but YuWon wasn\u2019t able to finish his sentence.\u201c\u2018I\u2019? \u2018I\u2019 what?\u2019 a thick voice penetrated his eardrums.YuWon opened his eyes. With his hazy vision, he turned towards the source of the voice, where he saw the blur of a large head.\u201cAhjussi\u2026?\u201d\u201cAhjussi? You really lack manners, don\u2019t you?\u201dThe quality of Hephaestus\u2019s voice really knocked the sleep out of YuWon. His foggy vision soon returned to normal, and he got up and looked around his surroundings.It was a small house in the slums. It seemed that Hephaestus decided to momentarily borrow the house of a slumdog that ran away because of the ruckus.\u201cWhen did you wake up?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cNow look here. I should be the one to ask you that.\u201dHephaestus couldn\u2019t believe it. The first thing the kid that was passed out asked him was when\u00a0he\u00a0had woken up.Though that was unsurprising. When Hephaestus had woken, YuWon had already lost consciousness, so the two couldn\u2019t help but be worried about each other.\u201cHow\u2019s your body?\u201d\u201cI seem more or less okay.\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t know how much time had passed, but most of the burns had healed up. He attributed his recovery to [Cinder Eyes] and his strong fire resistance.\u201cWhat about you, Ahjussi?\u201d\u201cHow long are you going to keep calling me that?\u201d\u201cWell, I can\u2019t call you Ahjumma.*\u201d*TL/N: Female equivalent of ahjussi, used to refer to middle-aged women.\u201cYou really know how to flap your mouth.\u201d\u201cBut you survived thanks to me, so what does it matter what I call you?\u201dYuWon was being brazen, but Hephaestus didn\u2019t really have a good response. He scratched his head because it was true. YuWon was the reason why he hadn\u2019t been dragged back to Olympus.Hephaestus was holding himself back, looking as if he badly wanted to say something.YuWon looked closely at him, wondering what he wanted to say.Soon, Hephaestus opened his mouth.\u201cThanks.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI said \u2018Thanks.\u2019 How many times do you want me to say it before you get it?\u201dDespite having only said it twice, Hephaestus got up and started fake coughing. He was clearly embarrassed.YuWon was actually impressed that he even said it twice.\u2018He tried pretty hard.\u2019The Hephaestus in YuWon\u2019s memory was someone that didn\u2019t use words to say thanks. He was more about actions than words because that was his life philosophy. Yet here was\u00a0that\u00a0Hephastus, saying \u2018thanks\u2019 and using his words.It was because Hephaestus knew that he had to be sincere.\u201cMy name\u2019s not actually Vulcaro,\u201d Hephaestus said with a serious look on his face. \u201cMy real name is Hephaestus. I was a blacksmith for Olympus.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t find that surprising?\u201d\u201cI am plenty surprised.\u201d\u201cAre you unable to lie, or can you just not be bothered to lie?\u201dHephaestus let out a baffled laugh after asking his question. He had already guessed that YuWon probably came searching for him knowing that he was Hephaestus. And because of the timing, he had even thought that YuWon might have been a member of Olympus.\u201cBut I\u2019m now certain.\u201dIt was a doubt that persisted in his thoughts for a while. Was YuWon a member of Olympus? If he wasn\u2019t, it\u2019d be odd. How would he have known how to find him? But then, if he was from Olympus, that\u2019d be equally as odd. Why didn\u2019t he try to capture him?Hephaestus originally had no answers for either question, but thanks to this event, he became certain of one thing.\u201cYou\u2019re not from Olympus. And you\u2019re definitely no ordinary player.\u201dYuWon was certainly not your average player. Chryses was injured after a fight with him, and he had received a significant degree of penalty. But still, for a new player to beat a Ranker in a fight\u2026\u201cFavors or misdeeds, I\u2019m someone who always pays back tenfold.\u201dYuWon already knew this very well.\u201cSince the Administrator intervened, Olympus won\u2019t be able to immediately come back to try and get me. That\u2019s why I rented out a big workshop in the city for a few days.\u201dA new workshop. The man that had no choice but to reside in a tiny workshop to hide from Olympus got himself a proper workshop.\u201cJust wait a few days.\u201dThough, that didn\u2019t affect the speed at which he could make something.\u201cI\u2019ll make you the greatest sword.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 44The recovery went faster than expected. It was thanks to his high Constitution stat and the medicine Hephaestus left him.After sleeping for a whole day, when he woke up, YuWon felt mostly recovered.\u2018I think I can start moving around now.\u2019Crack, crack\u2014He couldn\u2019t remember the last time he had laid down for so long. It had only been a day, but he already felt like his body had stiffened up.\u2018I ended up facing a Ranker much sooner than I expected. I also thought I wouldn\u2019t face Olympus until at least the 10th Floor, but things got ahead of schedule.\u2019Now fully lucid, YuWon sat up and started slowly stretching.\u2018Still, despite my plans being thrown out the window, I gained something huge, so it\u2019s fine.\u2019Hephaestus finally came out of hiding.With the intervention of the Administrator, Olympus wouldn\u2019t be able to plan another extreme intervention on the 1st Floor with a Ranker like this time. They\u2019d need at least a few years for another attempt, and those few years would be plenty of time for YuWon to bring about change.\u2018With Ahjussi\u2019s help, I\u2019ll be able to obtain items much easier. And I also managed to rebuild our relationship much faster than I expected\u2026\u2019Ssk\u2014YuWon put on the \u300cPyromancy Robe\u300d that he had temporarily stored in his inventory.\u2018And more than anything else, this is going to greatly affect the second Gigantomachy.\u2019YuWon stared at the black gem in his hand.\u2018It was an immense net positive.\u2019There was no need for him to properly calculate his gains and losses. On one hand, he had refined the black crystal, gained a huge supporter in Hephaestus, greatly influenced the Gigantomachy, and put Olympus under the close watch of the Administrator.On the other hand, he\u2019d made an enemy out of Olympus. But that was something that was bound to happen, so he hadn\u2019t really lost much.\u201cSo there\u2019s only one day remaining.\u201dHephaestus was one to never break his promises. A day ago, he\u2019d promised that it would take him two days to make him the greatest sword using mythril.YuWon had high hopes. Not only did he obtain the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal,\u300d he was also going to be given an item of really high caliber very soon.\u2018As soon as the sword is finished\u2026\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes were filled with spirit as he walked out of the hospital room.\u2018\u2026 I\u2019ll start the raid.\u2019* * *Vzzt\u2014!Fshhhh\u2014The mana from the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d quickly disintegrated the monsters\u2019 bodies. This was due to the special property of dark mana.[Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s] completion rate went up by just a little bit.While trudging through the corpses of the gorilla-like monsters around him, YuWon looked down at the crystal in his hand.\u2018It\u2019s surprisingly hard to handle.\u2019YuWon thought back to the power of the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d used by Hades. If the \u300cHelm of Invisibility\u300d was the sun, the current \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d was no more than a firefly. It might not have been the completed Helm and just a refined crystal, but the difference in power was too great.\u2018Which means that it\u2019s the difference in users.\u2019YuWon might have scored a tie against a Ranker in his last fight, but that was only because it was on the 1st Floor. And there was also the fact that Chryses was heavily injured from the fight with Hephaestus, along with the penalty.\u2018So I can\u2019t control this properly quite yet.\u2019YuWon checked the status of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d[Pure Dark Divine Crystal]\u15cc A fragment that holds the darkness of the genesis. It contains mana with an unending dark property.\u15cc Classification : crafting material.\u15cc Capable of Stealth.\u15cc Can change mana to Dark attribute.\u15cc Hell Summon (limited)\u15cc 50% increase in dark-type mana resistance.\u15cc 30% increase in Dark attribute mana amplification rate.\u15cc 30% decrease in Dark attribute mana consumption rate.There were three major changes:The \u2018unrefined\u2019 status disappeared.\u00a0The resistance, amplification rate, and consumption rate changed.And 3. \u2018Hell summon.\u2019It was the effect that was the most noticeable.\u2018Hell\u2019 was a word that symbolized Hades, and it was also like the fountain of his power.However, as the \u2018limited\u2019 mark said, YuWon couldn\u2019t use all the power of the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d yet. Still, this gave a proper insight to its true power.\u2018The Crystal is less of an item that holds power, and it\u2019s more a medium that summons power.\u2019Hell. YuWon didn\u2019t know what kind of place it was. It could be literally the world after death, or it could be the name of another world outside of the Tower. But one thing was for sure. The \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d was an item that extracted power from that world.\u2018I am starting to somewhat get the hang of it, though.\u2019For a whole day, YuWon practiced using the Crystal.Also, from the battle against Chryses, he was able to learn the limits of his own strength.It took much longer for him to start the raid, but he gained enough things to compensate for it during that time.And right on cue\u2026[ Hephaestus : Come on over.]\u2026 YuWon got a message from Hephaestus, who had changed his name on his player kit.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *On the outskirts of the city\u2026Fwoosh, woosh\u2014The workshop with a low ceiling and thin tunnels was filled with heat.It was a pretty decent workshop.\u2018It must have cost him a pretty penny.\u2019It seemed that Hephaestus had quite a lot of money saved up, but that wasn\u2019t much of a surprise. Items that he made were worth at least tens of thousands of points, and he also got a cut of all equipment sold by Olympus. He was probably part of the top 1% of Rankers in terms of wealth.\u201cToday\u2019s a quiet day.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201dHephaestus welcomed YuWon with his usual greeting. Impatient as ever, he immediately brought out the stuff.\u201cHere you go.\u201dHephaestus handed him a small wooden box and a sword wrapped in black cloth.YuWon took them in each hand, and then asked while shaking the wooden box, \u201cI get the sword, but what\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cOpen it.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dYuWon put down the sword for a moment to open up the box, but there was nothing inside.\u201cIs it supposed to be a prank box?\u201d\u201cYou idiot. Take a closer look.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing inside\u2026\u201dWhen he placed his hand inside the wooden box, he felt a smooth sensation at the tips of his fingers. YuWon\u2019s eyes sparkled. Closely getting a feel of it, he could tell the form of the thing.\u2018A glove.\u2019[Invisible Glove]\u15cc A thin glove made from a special material. It has a great mana conductivity.\u15cc It can be made invisible through the Settings.The item name and description was simple and straightforward. It was made from a special material, and it had great mana conductivity.From those two pieces of information, YuWon could tell what it was made from.\u201cDid you make this with mythril?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quick to tell.\u201dHephaestus let out a joyous laugh.Mythril was a mineral whose strength was in its high mana conductivity. It was even said that when you imbued mana into a sword made solely out of mythril, it felt like an extension of your body.YuWon put the \u300cInvisible Glove\u300d on his hand. Because it was literally invisible, the only way to put it on was by using his sense of touch.After struggling to put on the glove\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t feel anything.\u2019\u2026 YuWon couldn\u2019t feel a thing. It was as if he wasn\u2019t wearing anything.He wondered why Hephaestus made him something like this. Not only would it have been a pain to make it invisible, it even used expensive mythril.YuWon didn\u2019t have to think for too long.\u201cThere\u2019s a groove.\u201dOn the back of the glove, there was a small inset. YuWon placed the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d into it.Fshhh\u2014The \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d attached itself to the glove. And then the crystal that was emitting a black light soon disappeared with the glove.The \u300cInvisible Glove\u300d wasn\u2019t a special item. It was to make it more convenient for YuWon to carry the Crystal so he didn\u2019t have to hold it in his hand anymore.\u2018So this was the reason why he mixed in mythril.\u2019YuWon opened and closed his hand, gathering the Crystal\u2019s mana in his palm.Despite there being a layer between him and the Crystal, YuWon could control the dark mana without any oddities as he liked. This was thanks to mythril\u2019s high mana conductivity.\u201cI\u2019m glad I don\u2019t have to explain how to use it. I didn\u2019t have time or materials, so I just half-assed it, so use it however you like.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll use it well.\u201d\u201cSay that after you\u2019ve checked your sword.\u201dYuWon nodded his head and unwrapped the black cloth.A matte grey scabbard. The shape and length was exactly the same as the \u300cWell-Sharpened Sword\u300dthat YuWon had requested.\u2018It\u2019s exactly the same.\u2019Just by unwrapping the cloth and touching it, YuWon could tell that this sword was truly epic.Shing\u2014YuWon slowly pulled it out of the scabbard. The sharp blade emitted its own light.Mythril was a faintly aqua-colored mineral, but the small quantity of the Dark Divine Crystal powder had completely tainted the sword black.It was truly an awesome sword. Just by holding it in his hand, he could sense how sharp it was.\u201cYou can name it.[\u2018Blacksmith : Hephaestus requests a name for the sword.][Please choose a name.]YuWon carefully inspected the sword.He didn\u2019t want to just name it after its appearance, instead wanting to decide after fully reading through the item description.[? (undecided)]\u15cc It\u2019s a weapon crafted by the blacksmith Hephaestus. It\u2019s been made using mythril and the remnants of a special crystal.\u15cc It can accumulate dark mana.\u15cc A maximum of 200% increase in stamina recovery rate in darkness.\u15cc A maximum of 100% increase in mana amplification rate in darkness.\u15cc A maximum of 100% increase in mana recovery rate in darkness.After checking the effects of the sword, YuWon\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018What kind of recovery options are these\u2026?\u2019It had a \u2018maximum\u2019 that only applied in a certain setting rather than a fixed rate, but the mana amplification rate and the stamina and mana recovery rates were already insane.Taking the stamina and mana recovery into account, he might be able to sustain a fight in darkness almost infinitely.\u2018A sword that increases my combat powers many-fold in darkness, as well as being capable of accumulating mana\u2026\u2019This wasn\u2019t simply a sharp and durable sword. It was a sword beyond all expectations.Shing\u2014YuWon looked at his reflection off the smooth surface of the sword. He was smiling slightly.Watching YuWon\u2019s reaction, Hephaestus felt boastful.\u201cHave you decided on a name?\u201dYuWon nodded his head.An onyx blade, specialized for night and darkness.\u201cI\u2019ll name it \u2018Edge of Nightfall.\u2019\u201d[You have obtained \u300cEdge of Nightfall.\u300d][By Hephaestus\u2019s will, \u300cEdge of Nightfall\u300d becomes bound to you.]A bound item. It seemed that Hephaestus didn\u2019t want this sword falling into anyone else\u2019s hands.That didn\u2019t matter to YuWon. Without some very special circumstances, there was no way he would sell a sword of this caliber for points.\u201c\u2018Edge of Nightfall\u2019? You sure about that name?\u201d Hephaestus asked.YuWon answered while sheathing his sword, \u201cWhy not? It\u2019s like a sharp sword of a deep, dark night.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dHephaestus couldn\u2019t believe it. For YuWon to be so edgy\u2026 He thought about scolding him, but decided to bite his tongue.YuWon fastened the sword around his waist with a satisfactory smile on his face, unaware of what was wrong.\u2018\u2026 He and the sword go well together,\u2019 Hephaestus thought while shaking his head and letting out a deep sigh. There was nothing he could do. YuWon was clearly happy with it.\u2018Too bad his naming sense sucks,\u2019 Hephaestus disapproved. As someone that considered a piece of equipment to truly be complete once it was named, he was quite discontent.Swallowing his grumbling, Hephaestus asked YuWon, \u201cWhat do you plan on doing now?\u201d\u201cI need to go up.\u201dThere was zero hesitation in YuWon\u2019s voice.Hephaestus nodded his head, knowing that would be his response. \u201cThat\u2019s what I thought.\u201dHis face shifted from one that was ready to nag him to one filled with concern.\u201cWhat do you plan on doing about Olympus?\u201d Hephaestus asked, averting his gaze.He felt sorry. Because of him, YuWon got caught up with Olympus, and that was a wave too tall for YuWon, who had just started climbing the Tower. So of course he was filled with worry.However\u2026\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018what will I do?\u2019\u201d\u2026 YuWon didn\u2019t seem all that concerned. Was it because he didn\u2019t know Olympus well enough? No, that wasn\u2019t it. There was probably no one in the Tower that knew Olympus as well as him.There was a response YuWon had long prepared for this question.\u201cI plan on taking them down\u2026\u201dHe pointed towards the roof of the workshop. No, he was actually pointing to the top of the enormous Tower.\u201c\u2026 From all the way up there down to here.\u201d___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 45Chapter 45After exiting the workshop, YuWon turned around and looked back at the door.There was no farewell. It was just the way Hephaestus did things. Before, YuWon thought he was just an unsentimental and cranky old man. However, he eventually found out that wasn\u2019t the case.\u2018Then or now, he really is the same.\u2019Hephaestus was a friend he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time. And for YuWon, who had come to the past all alone, meeting a younger Hephaestus was a truly enjoyable time.He was suddenly reminded of past encounters with Hephaestus.\u201cI lost my sword.\u201d\u201cReally? Well I guess I have to make you a new one.\u201dWhen the fight with the Outer Gods was nearing its end, Hephaestus created a new weapon for YuWon when he had returned empty-handed.Forget adamantium or mythril, the greatest metals, the world had become a place where even iron ore was hard to obtain. So YuWon wondered what weapon Hephaestus could possibly have made him.But then\u2026\u201cAhjussi, this is\u2026\u201dHephaestus had made him a far better weapon than the one YuWon had previously owned.He wondered where Hephaestus had gotten the materials from.The sword Hephaestus handed him was made from adamantium, and from what YuWon knew, there was a very small, limited amount of adamantium left in the world nearing the Apocalypse. And this adamantium was\u2026\u201cDid you melt your hammer?\u201dHephaestus\u2019s hand had been wrapped with thick bandages.YuWon could immediately tell how he got injured. After melting down his hammer for materials, he had used his fist as a hammer to forge YuWon a new sword.YuWon asked why he did that, and his response was as typical of him as ever.\u201cDon\u2019t nag me and just take it already. I\u2019m tired.\u201dIt was a hammer he had spent his life with. After becoming a Ranker, he never put his hammer down, becoming a blacksmith recognized not just in Olympus, but in the whole Tower.Hephaestus had melted down that hammer to make a new sword for YuWon.That was how YuWon came to know Hephaestus\u2019s true personality.Grip\u2014YuWon tightly grasped the handle of the sword at his waist.Out of melancholy, he had a hard time leaving, but he quickly snapped out of it. YuWon bowed his head towards Hephaestus\u2019s workshop.\u201cThank you for everything.\u201d* * *There were many types of tests inside the Tower. From individual tests where you had to complete a specific mission, to group tests where you had to complete a specific mission with others, and scenario tests where you had to find the answer within a specific story created by the Tower.The test on the 1st Floor was always identical.\u201cName, Kim YuWon. A new player that entered the 1st Floor twelve days ago.\u201dA beautiful Elf lady with straight black hair that reached her hips checked YuWon\u2019s information on her player kit while biting a huge piece of chocolate.\u201cHe set a historic new record in the Tutorial, and his potential is rated as S-rank\u2026\u201dSnap\u2014Shuri was a Ranker that was currently ranked in the top 10,000.She smiled while looking at YuWon\u2019s picture on her player kit.\u201cThere\u2019s quite a few good newbies this time around.\u201dNot too long ago, she had managed to meet a player that was a feast for the eyes, which was something she hadn\u2019t experienced in a while.It was a Pure-Blood from Olympus, a direct descendent of the Ruler of the Skies.\u2018That Hargaan was only second place.\u2019Descendents of Olympus were the center of attention in every Tutorial. And the son of the Ruler of the Skies was rumored to be talented to the point that many Rankers had already set their eyes on him.So Shuri couldn\u2019t help but become interested in YuWon after she had presumed that Hargaan was going to be first in the Tutorial.In the 1st Floor testing center, YuWon was the only one standing in the middle of the massive Colosseum.\u2018For him to participate in the test alone\u2026\u2019 Shuri thought.Most players didn\u2019t participate in tests alone, but formed a \u2018team\u2019 with people of a similar skill level. The reason for this was simple. It came down to efficiency and the level of difficulty.Ten players with a variety of skills had the power equivalent of twenty or even thirty people. So a team with a good composition would have a much easier time with the test than a player that was by themselves.However\u2026\u2018There\u2019s only one reason why he would participate alone,\u2019 Shuri thought while looking down at YuWon. She leaned on the arm of her chair, chin on her hand.\u201cSo he thinks there\u2019s no one who can rival him on this floor.\u201dIt was a truly arrogant decision, but Shuri didn\u2019t think it was a foolish decision. In fact, she thought it was very wise.* * ** * *The stage that represented the 1st Floor, the Colosseum, was the stage where the 1st Floor\u2019s test was held regularly. It was also famous for being unbreakable. The Colosseum\u2019 structure was so durable that sometimes Rankers would come all the way down to the 1st Floor to duel.\u2018I like that this test is pretty straightforward.\u2019Shing\u2014YuWon unsheathed his new sword, \u300cEdge of Nightfall.\u300dThe purpose of the 1st Floor\u2019s test was to check if one had the power to take down chosen opponents.For YuWon, it was already a certainty that he would pass this test.So the crux was\u2026\u2018Was the highest record Son OhGong\u2019s?\u2019[Ranking][1st : Son OhGong \u2013 Round 19][2nd : Hercules \u2013 Round 18][2nd : Odin \u2013 Round 18][4th : Asura \u2013 Round 17][4th : \u2026]After checking the Colosseum rankings, YuWon shook his head, seeing Son OhGong\u2019s ranking. It was far above his original one.\u2018My previous record was round 12. I think it was a Dullahan that I faced?\u2019There was no end to the Colosseum test. Well, to be more accurate, no one had ever seen the end.When you defeated an enemy, the next appeared, and when you defeated that one, a subsequent enemy appeared, and so on. It was an unending stream of enemies.Luckily, you could give up in the middle, or you could move onto the next floor as long as you defeated the first enemy.But since you could obtain a better reward the more opponents you defeated, players that aimed to become Rankers pushed themselves, rechallenging the Colosseum until they hit their limit.[12th: Hargaan \u2013 Round 16]YuWon spotted a familiar name.Hargaan probably sent his teammates up first while he continued to rechallenge the Colosseum.\u2018That\u2019s a pretty high record.\u2019Round 16 was a record that rivaled the top 100 rankers.\u2018Did he manage to get a higher ranking thanks to the King\u2019s Lightning Glove? He\u2019ll end up making his way up much faster than I anticipated.\u2019YuWon already verified Hargaan\u2019s skill during the Tutorial and in the fight against the Jackals. He actually possessed the qualities necessary to one day stand at the top of the Tower and become the King of Olympus. And on top of that, thanks to his encounter with YuWon, he even ended up obtaining the \u300cKing\u2019s Lightning Glove,\u300d an item worth tens of thousands of points.It was like a tiger had been gifted wings. And this also applied to Hargaan\u2019s teammates as well.\u2018I guess I\u2019ll be hearing news of him soon enough.\u2019Hargaan started climbing the Tower before YuWon. YuWon was curious what floor he might be on by now.\u2018I\u2019ll see you soon enough.\u2019[THE TEST WILL NOW START.][PLEASE DEFEAT YOUR OPPONENT.]Klunk\u2014With the message, a door on the opposite end of the Colosseum opened up.\u201cKweeek, kwik\u2014\u201dClatter\u2014A tall Orc wearing heavy armor and wielding a glaive stepped out.The first trial of the 1st Floor Colosseum was an Orc Warrior.Over two meters tall, it was a beefy, shredded monster. It was completely different from ordinary Orcs that were mostly just fat. Not only was it much bigger in size, it\u2019s body was like that of a well-trained soldier.The 1st Floor Colosseum was a test designed to measure one\u2019s capabilities as a warrior with the Orc Warrior.\u201cKweek\u2014\u201dThe Orc Warrior spotted YuWon.YuWon was already approaching the Orc Warrior, wielding \u300cEdge of Nightfall,\u300d which he had already prepared earlier.\u201cKkweeegh\u2014!\u201dSeeing the sword in YuWon\u2019s hand, the Orc Warrior displayed its bloodthirst.Whirr\u2014[Arcane Sword]Around YuWon\u2019s sword, mana that emitted a black light started gathering.And in a flash, YuWon\u2019s sword vertically passed through the Orc Warrior\u2019s body.Shahh\u2014A gentle cutting sound.Slash\u2014!The Orc Warrior\u2019s body was sliced in half, including its armor.Thud, thud\u2014The Orc Warrior\u2019s corpse dropped to the ground, and the glaive that it tried to swing at YuWon ended up getting buried in the dust.[Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 0.008%.][You have passed the test of the 1st Floor.][Would you like to challenge the next trial?][Would you like to move onto the next floor?]A message popped up for YuWon.With that, the 1st Floor\u2019s test was over. For any player with the skills to defeat an Orc Warrior, the 1st Floor\u2019s test was merely a checkpoint that they had to go through. But the true value of the 1st Floor\u2019s test was elsewhere.\u201cChallenge.\u201d[You have chosen to challenge the next trial.][STARTING THE 2ND TRIAL.]Fshh\u2014The Orc Warrior\u2019s corpse turned into black dust and disappeared.Soon after, the door that the Orc Warrior came out of opened again.Thump, thump\u2014The sound of heavy footsteps.\u201cKkweek, kkwi\u2014!\u201d\u201cKkeeeek\u2014!\u201dThe second trial of the Colosseum consisted of two Warrior Orcs. The trial had become twice as hard.However, YuWon was already at the door.Phssh\u2014A black line was drawn across the Orc Warriors\u2019 bodies.Splash\u2014!The two Orcs\u2019 heads were cut off, splattering blood everywhere.[Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 0.016%.][You have passed the 2nd trial.][Would you like to challenge the next trial?][Would you like to move onto the next floor?]Another message.While looking at the entrance of the Colosseum, YuWon replied to the message, \u201cChallenge.\u201d* * *At a certain point, Shuri, who was spectating the test, couldn\u2019t keep her mouth closed.When she first saw YuWon cut down the Orc Warrior, she wasn\u2019t all that impressed. When YuWon cut down two more Orc Warriors, she thought that was plenty doable, since that was something that even Hargaan had done easily.However, as he passed the third and fourth trials\u2026 With every round that YuWon completed, Shuri finally realized what she was seeing.\u201cIsn\u2019t this\u2026\u201dGulp\u2014Her eyes had widened, and without even realizing, she had gotten up from her seat.\u201c\u2026 A historic moment?\u201dWithin the Tower\u2019s seemingly infinite history, Shuri had been the test examiner at the Colosseum for thousands of years. And in her memories, there was a single person she remembered as the greatest participant.\u2018He\u2019s even faster than Son OhGong.\u2019It was the one who went by the title of \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal,\u201d also known as the \u201cVictorious Fighting Buddha,\u201d the High Ranker Son OhGong.He was the man who had set the highest record in the 1st Floor test. And right now, YuWon was clearing the trials of the Colosseum at a faster rate than the great Son OhGong.Ka-thump\u2014!YuWon crashed into the center of the Colosseum.The ninth trial, a horde of armored Skeletons fell over like bowling pins. And just like that, another trial was easily cleared.YuWon had yet to even use a proper skill. Since he was fighting without rest, he was carefully managing his stamina and mana.\u2018He\u2019s not even cornered by the trial right in front of him.\u2019She was sure of it.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018He\u2019s looking much farther ahead.\u2019YuWon was fighting against the great beings of the Tower. He was trying to surpass the records set by the High Rankers.And so, YuWon had reached the tenth trial.___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 46Chapter 46Fwoosh\u2014!YuWon shot out vibrant red fire from his hands.[Cinder Eyes controls Colossal Fire.][Colossal Fire \u2014 Colossal Sword]A scorching mana. Wrapped in [Colossal Fire,] YuWon\u2019s sword grew multiple times in size.The brilliant fire in the middle of the Colosseum flew quickly down towards the swordsman in front of YuWon.Klang\u2014!Two swords clashed against each other.YuWon\u2019s eyes shined.\u2018You actually blocked it?\u2019Kkk, kkkk\u2014The swordsman\u2019s blade was on the brink of shattering. To begin with, it wasn\u2019t a proper sword. It was nothing more than a completely dull, rusted hunk of metal.YuWon wondered how the swordsman could swing such a large sword so easily.The fight started dragging on.\u2018I don\u2019t need to drag it out too long.\u2019Once again, YuWon gathered up his mana.Fwoosh\u2014The flames roared.In response to YuWon\u2019s attack, from within the old helm, a blue light flashed from the swordsman\u2019s eyes.Fwooo\u2014An unbelievable level of mana started radiating out of the swordsman.Tmp\u2014Every time YuWon and the swordsman took a step, an imprint was left on the ground.A collision between two manas, a fight between powerhouses started.Kk-crack, crack\u2014Shwoo\u2014[Your arm has been imbued with the power of a Giant.][You have a low proficiency.][Your Constitution is too low.][Partial Gigantification will occur.]The power of a Giant started buffing YuWon\u2019s arm.Shatter\u2014The swordsman\u2019s weapon broke.Slash\u2014YuWon sliced the swordsman\u2019s chest. He didn\u2019t manage to cut him in half like he intended, but it was still a deep slice. The tip of his sword likely cut into the swordsman\u2019s intestines.\u201cKgh\u2026\u201dThud\u2014The swordsman fell to his knee. His helmet was sliced open, falling off his head.Plop, roll, roll, roll\u2014The helmet rolled away, and the swordsman\u2019s face was revealed.Almost brunette, dirty blonde hair. A face covered in wrinkles. A single eye.Perhaps because YuWon\u2019s sword had reached his head, the swordsman had a bleeding scar on his face.\u201cIf you had a better sword, this would have been much harder.\u201d\u201c\u2026 You know better than me that even if that was the case, you would have won in the end.\u201d The swordsman wore a bitter smile.YuWon didn\u2019t deny it. It was definitely harder than a standard trial, but he still didn\u2019t find this all that difficult. He did use [Gigantification] since it was an enemy that was stronger than he had anticipated, but he still had a few aces up his sleeves.It was a crushing defeat for the swordsman, but that actually made him feel better.\u201cAnd this makes it a second time.\u201dFrom YuWon\u2019s memory, in the long history of the Tower, the swordsman had only ever faced defeat once. It was by the top Ranker that set the highest record in the 1st Floor Colosseum, \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal,\u201d Son OhGong.\u201cHe was also really strong. He was the first ever opponent that stood back up no matter how many times he was cut or stabbed. But with you, there\u2019s a very slight difference\u2026\u201dWhile on his knees, the swordsman looked up at YuWon.\u201cYou\u2026 are far stronger.\u201dThere was a hint of respect mixed into his words.YuWon remembered hearing about the swordsman from OhGong to no end.\u201cThat guy is incredibly strong. In terms of pure swordsmanship, he\u2019s probably better than most Rankers.\u201dSon OhGong was the only player to ever defeat the swordsman and move onto the next round. Except for him, the other Rankers were unable to surpass him.YuWon had wondered why. Now, after having personally gone up against him, he understood.\u2018The difficulty is way too intense for a trial on the 1st Floor.\u2019YuWon hadn\u2019t anticipated that he\u2019d need to use Gigantification on the nineteenth trial. That was how much the swordsman\u2019s skill had broken YuWon\u2019s expectations. And this wasn\u2019t even the final trial.\u2018No wonder people can\u2019t get past this.\u2019YuWon didn\u2019t instantly finish off the swordsman. He tried to drag this out and buy as much time to recover the lost stamina and mana he had expended during the fight.\u201cSo you plan on challenging the next trial.\u201dYuWon nodded in response to his question.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI knew it. I wish I could watch that myself,\u201d the swordsman said, with a wistful face.The light reflected off of him, creating a longing atmosphere. He was a man that looked like he truly belonged in the Colosseum.\u201cThanks to you\u2026 I was able to\u2026 once again\u2026 fight with joy\u2026\u201dThe swordsman stopped talking. He died with his eyes open.YuWon reached out his hand, and closed his eyes for him.[You leveled up.][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 4.78%.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Dexterity increased by 1.][Your Constitution\u2026][You have passed the 19th trial.][Would you like to challenge the final trial?][Would you like to move onto the next floor?]YuWon\u2019s eyes widened.\u2018Final.\u2019The unconquerable twentieth trial. The final trial.\u2018Even OhGong wasn\u2019t able to clear the next trial.\u2019The only person who knew that the twentieth trial was the final one was OhGong. This was because he was the only one to ever defeat the swordsman in the nineteenth trial.However, even that guy, who was harder to kill than a cockroach, couldn\u2019t pass the twentieth trial.There were two reasons for that. The first was the injuries and depleted stamina from the fight against the swordsman. The second was\u2026[Would you like to challenge the final trial?][Would you like to move onto the next floor?]The message popped up as soon as the swordsman died.YuWon didn\u2019t answer it.Up until earlier, he had shouted \u201cChallenge\u201d right away, but this time he couldn\u2019t. Not only did he use [Gigantification] in the fight against the nameless swordsman, he hadn\u2019t managed to take a single break while rushing to the nineteenth trial.YuWon needed at least a little bit of time to recover, as well as to make the necessary preparations.\u2018With this, I\u2019ve achieved the same record as OhGong.\u2019YuWon knew he would be able to clear the nineteenth trial.\u2018The problem is the final trial.\u2019The reward for the 1st Floor\u2019s test depended on how many trials one completed.Currently, YuWon held the record for most trials completed, along with OhGong. Because of that, he had high expectations for the reward.In addition, there was also the completion rate for the [Heaven-Slaying Star.]\u20184.78%\u2026 The completion rate went up quite a bit from that last trial.\u2019The completion rate went up in accordance to defeating beings of a higher caliber.Though this did raise a question for YuWon\u2014despite the nameless swordsman being stronger than the Chimera Creator, why did the completion rate increase by less?\u2018Is it because it\u2019s not set as a boss? Or maybe it took into account the Chimera Creator\u2019s ability to make Chimeras\u2026\u2019There wasn\u2019t a way to know the metric behind how the completion rate increased. But one thing was for sure. It gave him a hell of a lot of stats.[Heaven-Slaying Star]# Rank : A+# Completion rate : 42.11%42%. And it was an A plus-rank skill to boot.The completion rate indicated that it was still an incomplete skill.\u2018I wonder how much it\u2019ll increase when I take down the next guy.\u2019And YuWon wondered how this skill would change once it was completed.While he was lost in thought without a care\u2026[If no response is given within 30 seconds, you will be automatically transported to the next floor.]30 seconds.This damn trial didn\u2019t give anyone time to rest. Though, to be fair, if it gave people time to rest between stages, it would defeat the purpose of the Colosseum, where you were meant to fight consecutive opponents.So YuWon wasn\u2019t given a long time to rest.YuWon replied right as the 30 seconds were almost up.\u201cChallenge.\u201d* * ** * *[You have chosen to challenge the final trial.][STARTING THE FINAL TRIAL.]As soon as that message popped up\u2026Rumble\u2014The floor of the Colosseum shook.The door opened wide, and from within, a faint cry could be heard.\u201c\u2014Khyaaa\u2014ah\u2014\u201dGoosebumps appeared across YuWon\u2019s body. It wasn\u2019t just because the cry felt threatening. It was the killing intent and mana within the cry that YuWon instinctively felt.\u201c\u2026 It really is\u00a0that\u00a0bastard.\u201dTense, YuWon went from wielding his sword with one hand to two hands.[Your arm has been imbued with the power of a Giant.]Crack, kk-crack\u2014Mana encircled the Gigantified right arm and his sword.YuWon waited for it.The noise got closer, and the shaking of the ground also grew louder with the noise.And finally\u2026[THE BOSS OF THE FINAL TRIAL HAS APPEARED.]\u201cKkiyaaaah\u2014!\u201dThe head that emerged from the door immediately started charging at YuWon.He was surprised. It ran at him at such a high speed, it was hard to properly recognize its form.Klaaang\u2014!The thing headbutted into YuWon\u2019s sword.Psk\u2014From that shock, its hard scales broke, and the hide underneath the scales was cut slightly.However\u2026\u201cKugh\u2026!\u201dYuWon was flung backwards from the high-speed impact. If he hadn\u2019t gripped his sword harder, it would have flown out of his hand.\u2018What kind of brute force\u2026?\u2019Having been waiting with [Gigantification] active, YuWon thought he wouldn\u2019t lose against anyone in terms of strength.The Giant Slayer, Hercules. [Gigantification] was his skill, and the man was greater than anyone in terms of pure strength, which was why YuWon displayed unparalleled strength on the 1st Floor.But right now\u2026Drag\u2014Wham\u2014!YuWon, who was barely holding on with his feet digging into the ground, ended up getting flung away.Thud, roll, roll.His body rolled on the floor.Sssshk\u2014YuWon quickly dug his hand into the ground to stop his roll.Luckily, because he had already braced for impact, the shock wasn\u2019t too powerful.YuWon quickly regained his form and stared back at the enemy that had entered the colosseum.\u201cHissss\u2014!\u201dIt was a giant snake.The thing slithered deeper into the colosseum and swung its long tail around.Thump\u2014!A dust cloud erupted.Something must have enraged it because the snake started rampaging around the Colosseum.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2026\u201dIt was a much bigger fellow than YuWon had anticipated.\u201cDamn Administrator. They really are doing whatever they like.\u201dThe 1st Floor\u2019s test was designed and created by the Administrator. Seeing as how there was a Ranker as a test examiner, this wasn\u2019t likely a test that had materialized from the Tower\u2019s own will.That was the case with all the trials after the tenth one because these trials were way too difficult for a player on the 1st Floor to be able to handle.Rumble\u2014 Smack\u2014!Crash\u2014!The impact was sent all the way to the audience seats in the Colosseum. As an indestructible building, the Colosseum was fine, but the sound still rang in YuWon\u2019s ears.Woom, wooom\u2014From the center of the Colosseum, YuWon stared at the master of the final trial.\u201cHisss\u2014!\u201dThe snake was long enough to encircle the colosseum once. Its body was meters thick, and its mouth was enormous. Its fangs alone were taller than YuWon.This was the final boss of the Colosseum.\u2018It only has a single head and tail\u2026\u2019Fss, fssss\u2014An ominous mana and threatening killing intent exuded from the creature.\u2018It\u2019s definitely\u00a0that\u00a0thing.\u2019It was far smaller, and comparatively its mana and killing intent was nothing, but YuWon was sure.At first YuWon didn\u2019t believe it. He thought that OhGong saw it wrong and that it was just a similar creature. However, after seeing it with his own eyes, he had no choice but to believe it.\u201cKkieeeegh\u2014!\u201dA snake with eight heads large enough to cover eight mountains and fill eight ravines. A being that was closer to a mythical or demonic beast or even a dragon, rather than a monster. It was a creature that was engulfed in all the anger in the world from conception and eternally cried out its rage.YuWon had heard that it was long ago sealed in Susanoo\u2019s sword, the \u300cKusanagi no Tsurugi.*\u300dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu*TL/N: \u201cGrass-Cutting Sword\u201d[PLEASE DEFEAT THE \u20187TH HEAD OF YAMATO NO OROCHI.\u2019]___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 47Chapter 47\u300aYamata no Orochi.\u300bIt was one of the most dangerous monsters in YuWon\u2019s memory. Among the monsters that existed in the Tower, it was a predator at the top of the food chain. It was also the thing that took Susanoo to the grave.It was an ancient shard of an Outer God.\u2018For this thing to actually be in the Colosseum.\u2019YuWon couldn\u2019t believe the difficulty. If the Administrator was here, YuWon would have cussed him out.\u201cKkiyah, hiss\u2014!\u201dThe beast unleashed its fury with a cry. Bloodthirst, anger, torment, all sorts of emotions could be heard in that cry.It only had one head, and it was significantly smaller than YuWon remembered, but it was still an extremely dangerous monster.Crash, slam\u2014!Ssss\u2014No matter how much the serpent thrashed around, the Colosseum stayed sturdy.At this point, it was simply a large animal. To put it in perspective, it was the equivalent of a newborn human baby. It was only loud.Unable to break anything, Orochi started throwing a louder tantrum.\u201cKkyaaah\u2014!\u201dIts cry echoed and filled the colosseum.YuWon started to find the beast loud and annoying.\u201cI\u2019ll have to take it down quickly.\u201dFwoosh\u2014A crimson light glimmered from YuWon\u2019s eyes.At the same time, the thrashing Orochi spotted YuWon.\u201cSssss\u2014\u201dIt flickered its long tongue, closely watching YuWon.The bloodthirst and mana that radiated from its eyes were quite ominous.Without warning, Orochi started charging at YuWon.Gnaaaw\u2014Crunch\u2014Orochi took a bite out of the ground.YuWon jumped to the side, landing with one hand on the ground.Orochi truly was a threat. Its bloodthirst was one thing, but there was also its size, which exerted a pressure. Being large in size was a powerful strength.\u2018I guess the silver lining is that all it has going for it is its size right now.\u2019As YuWon tightly gripped his sword\u2026Slam\u2014!Orochi\u2019s tail slammed down towards YuWon\u2019s head.Slam, slam, slam\u2014!Seething with anger, it continued to slam its tail down, even though YuWon\u2019s body would have been turned into mincemeat after the first strike.After it had swung its tail countless times\u2026\u201cThe Orochi I knew wouldn\u2019t have acted like this.\u201dVzzt\u2014Orochi sensed an ominous energy above his head.Crash\u2014!It felt a blow on its head.Vzzzzt\u2014!A rain of black light swallowed up the surrounding light as Orochi\u2019s head shook and fell.\u201cKkkiyaaaaaaah\u2014!\u201dFeeling excruciating pain, it let out a scream as it thrashed around. It shook its head, trying to get YuWon off of it, but he endured, swinging his sword.[\u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d]The \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d concealed by the invisible glove let out a black light that started enveloping \u300cEdge of Nightfall.\u300dThis was a completely different sensation to the one he felt while fighting Chryses.\u2018This is much better.\u2019The energy of the Crystal wasn\u2019t something that could be controlled by a mere normal sword. This energy wore out one\u2019s body just by using it and made any normal weapon that took on its power disintegrate rapidly.However, \u300cEdge of Nightfall\u300d was different. It was an item Hephaestus forged using the powder from the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d As it held the same property, it had no risk of disintegrating from the Crystal\u2019s power.YuWon widely swung the sword filled with the energy from the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal.\u300dKlang\u2014!Ting, ting\u2014The hard scales and tough leather impeded YuWon\u2019s attack. Even though the scales and skin were being cut apart, causing Orochi to bleed, the wounds were too shallow.Whoosh\u2014Dash\u2014With Orochi\u2019s tail flying above his head, YuWon jumped down to the ground.He wasn\u2019t satisfied by the cuts he had inflicted. All he managed to do was make the thing bleed a little.However\u2026Fssh\u2014\u201cHissss\u2014!\u201dOrochi trashed around in pain from the Crystal\u2019s mana, which had penetrated through the cuts on its skin.YuWon stared at Orochi, writhing in pain, coiling up its body.\u201cIt\u2019s way too fucking sturdy.\u201dIts scales and skin were far tougher than YuWon had anticipated.Thanks to the Crystal\u2019s power, he managed to inflict some damage on it, but it was still nothing if you took its large size into account.YuWon needed a plan B.\u2018This might be the twentieth trial, but this is still the 1st Floor.\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes darted around the Colosseum.\u2018The difficulty shot up way too high, almost to an impossible level.\u2019\u201cKkkiyagh\u2014!\u201dThe wounded Orochi started swinging its tail around even more violently.YuWon continued to avoid its tail, chipping away at its scales and leather.Slash, slash\u2014!\u201cKkiyaagh\u2014!\u201dThe number of wounds on Orochi increased. But unlike previously, it stopped screaming and coiling up. Maybe it was overtaken by anger, but it continued to rampage after YuWon, fiercely whipping its tail around.Slam\u2014!Dust was kicked up.Every single attack was powerful enough to chill one\u2019s spine.\u201cPhew\u2014\u201dWith higher focus came a faster consumption of stamina.After a certain point, YuWon stopped swinging his sword around.Some time passed.YuWon, who was busy avoiding Orochi, stopped in his tracks, and his crimson eyes looked to a specific spot.\u201c\u2026 Found it.\u201dSlam\u2014!Orochi\u2019s tail fell on top of YuWon\u2019s head.* * *\u2018So you showed yourself, \u300aYamata no Orochi.\u300b\u2019The text examiner for the 1st Floor, Shuri, got up after seeing the boss make its appearance inside the Colosseum.Due to her contract with the Administrator as a test examiner, she wasn\u2019t permitted to speak about the contents of the test with anyone. That\u2019s why she couldn\u2019t let anyone know about the existence of the creature in front of her, even though she was aware that the \u201cThree Precious Children\u201d were looking for \u300aYamata no Orochi.\u300bThis was the second time she was seeing that giant creature.The first time she found out about Orochi\u2019s existence, Shuri shouted in disbelief.\u201cHow does this make any sense?!\u201dThe twentieth trial was at a difficulty that no 1st Floor player could ever conquer.The same could be said for the nineteenth trial, the nameless swordsman, but at least in the fight against him, one could win with a mix of skills and luck.But in comparison to this monstrosity\u2026Its body was big enough to take up half the Colosseum, and its fangs were longer than a person\u2019s height.Though it didn\u2019t have any special abilities because it only had one head, it was still \u300aYamata no Orochi.\u300b\u201cSo the rising rookie\u2019s challenge ends here.\u201dShuri shook her head, watching YuWon get flung away after Orochi\u2019s sudden appearance.It was as she had expected.\u2018You can\u2019t beat something like that.\u2019\u300aYamata no Orochi\u300b wasn\u2019t a being that a 1st Floor player could challenge.The original Orochi was literally capable of insta-killing a player in the lower floors just by looking at them.Even the great\u00a0Son OhGong couldn\u2019t surpass this Orochi. OhGong had lost consciousness during the fight, and by fainting, the system failed him on the twentieth trial.YuWon had unbelievable tenacity. Despite only being a 1st Floor player, he had survived a hit from Orochi\u2019s tail.\u2018Give up already. You\u2019ve already set a historic record.\u2019A new player that cleared the nineteenth trial. Though Son OhGong had already set this record, the Tower would eternally remember YuWon\u2019s record as well. That should be enough, since, as a 1st Floor player, there was no way he would be able to even leave a scratch on Orochi\u2026Vzzt\u2014!Mana emitting black light flowed out from YuWon\u2019s hands.Shuri\u2019s eyes widened, seeing the mana suck up the surrounding light as it swirled around YuWon\u2019s sword.\u201cSuch recklessness\u2026!\u201dAnd that\u2019s when it happened.Pssk\u2014\u201cKkkyaaah\u2014!\u201dOrocho screamed, its scales and skin cut apart.The mana that snuck into the open wounds rotted away its flesh.As if it was spooked, Orochi coiled up.Shuri was left speechless. She couldn\u2019t believe Orochi was shying away.But more importantly\u2026\u2018He cut through Orochi\u2019s scales and skin.\u2019A 1st Floor player, a brand new player that had just finished the Tutorial no less, had managed to cut Orochi\u2019s skin.She couldn\u2019t believe this.Slam, slam\u2014!Thump\u2014!Orochi widely flung its tail around.YuWon darted around, avoiding its tail while inflicting more wounds on Orochi with his sword.Fsh, fsh\u2014The number of cuts on Orochi gew,.It no longer cared about being wounded. Instead, it swung its tail and bared its fangs with the sole purpose of killing its enemy.YuWon kept cutting it so close that Shuri was scared for him.That\u2019s when she realized something.\u2018Why\u2026?\u2019Shuri noticed that YuWon had stopped using his sword a while back. This was odd, considering how YuWon\u2019s sword was capable of cutting through Orochi\u2019s scales and hide.\u2018So why is he\u2026?\u2019As she pondered\u2026\u201c\u2026 Found it,\u201d said YuWon, who had stopped in his tracks.\u2018What\u2019s he looking at?\u2019 Shuri wondered.His eyes were a crimson color, and she could have sworn she\u2019d seen eyes like his before.\u2018Could it be?\u2019She saw the face of a great being overlapping with YuWon\u2019s face.Slam\u2014!Orochi\u2019s tail fell on top of YuWon\u2019s head, but Shuri didn\u2019t freak out.This was no time for her to freak out.As a Ranker, she could see it clearly.\u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asked.In a short span of time, YuWon had managed to twist his body to avoid Orochi\u2019s tail and get on top of him.Tap, taka, taka, taka\u2014YuWon ran across Orochi\u2019s body by using the openings between the scales as a stepping stone.Orochi wiggled around to try and shake YuWon off, but it was unsuccessful as YuWon continued to jump up its body.This wasn\u2019t something that was possible with just pure stats alone.\u2018What in the world is he planning\u2026?\u2019Once he was at the center of Orochi\u2019s body, YuWon changed the grip on his sword to a reverse grip.Finally Shuri understood what YuWon was up to.\u201cCould that place be\u2026?\u201dThere was a small indent near Orochi\u2019s heart, the only part of his body not covered in scales. That was Orochi\u2019s reverse scale.Suddenly an unchanging fact entered Shuri\u2019s head.No matter how high the difficulty of the Colosseum increased, this was still a part of the 1st Floor\u2019s test. And the Tower and the Administrators did not give tests that could never be cleared.Psshk\u2014YuWon\u2019s sword pierced Orochi\u2019s reverse scale.Pshk\u2014Orochi did not scream. Instead of crying in pain, Orochi stopped letting out any sound.\u201cKkhaa\u2026 Kkiyagh\u2026\u201dThe snake\u2019s sharp eyes started turning murky, and its body slowly stiffened up.This was an old tale. A sinister snake that could cover eight mountains and ravines with its body, capable of using strange spells and enchantments.The one who managed to bring down this enormous catastrophe that almost annihilated a floor was the High Ranker Susanoo.Susanoo used an indestructible sword. There were special enchantments on it, and one of them was the power to seal a being that was pierced with this sword.The name of the sword was \u300cTotsuka no Tsurugi.*\u300dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu*TL/N: \u201cSword of Ten Hand-Breadths\u201dWith that sword, Susanoo was able to inflict a wound that could never be erased on Orochi\u2019s chest. That became the only reverse scale on Orochi, and it was the only way to clear the final trial of the Colosseum.And now, in this place, a legend was reenacted.___Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 48[You leveled up.][Heaven-Slaying Star\u2019s completion rate increased by 12.85%.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Dexterity increased by 2.][Your Constitution\u2026][\u2026][You have passed the final trial.][Your achievement is recorded in the Colosseum.]Thud\u2014Following the message that YuWon passed the trial, Orochi\u2019s body fell in the center of the arena.A deep rumbling was felt through the ground.YuWon took a moment to catch his breath before checking his increased stats.[Name : Kim YuWon][Level : 69][Strength : 78][Dexterity : 62][Constitution : 70][Perception : 60][Arcane Power : 72][Total Points\u2026][\u2026]He leveled up again, even though he had just leveled up after defeating the swordsman in the nineteenth trial.\u2018That\u2019s stupendous.\u2019Logically, leveling became harder the more you leveled up. Starting around level 60, it became virtually impossible to level up through normal hunting.That\u2019s why most players preferred to obtain power through the floor clear rewards, rather than trying to level up by hunting and grinding. This was because all you got from leveling up was three stat points, but when you cleared a floor, the reward could potentially be even better than ten stat points.However, one could never become a Ranker by setting levels aside.\u2018Only 31 more to go till I reach Level 100.\u2019YuWon was leveling up much faster than he had anticipated.Due to having lost his levels and stats from going back in time, his body felt as heavy as a pile of rocks, but that feeling had now mostly dissipated.\u201cParticipant Kim YuWon.\u201dYuWon turned his head to the voice calling him.An Elven woman wearing leather armor and holstering a total of six swords on her waist and back approached YuWon.YuWon wondered where she appeared from.Her movements were so quick and stealthy that YuWon had a hard time sensing her presence. In actuality, those graceful movements weren\u2019t intentional, but just a force of habit.A beautiful but intimidating face. Long straight hair. And a lover of chocolates.\u2018Shuri.\u2019She was a pretty highly ranked Ranker. She was on another level of power compared to Chryses, who YuWon had faced off against recently.She also happened to be the test examiner of the 1st Floor.\u201cDid you already know about \u300aYamata no Orochi\u300b?\u201dYuWon had wondered why the text examiner would approach a participant. Turned out she had some questions.YuWon nodded his head at her question.\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cThen that wound was\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was a wound inflicted by the High Ranker Susanoo.\u201dThat was enough of an explanation. With her doubts confirmed by YuWon, she finally got the answer to the mystery she\u2019d been pondering. It was a wound caused by Susanoo, and YuWon was able to pass the final trial of the Colosseum by finding and piercing that wound.\u201cHow did you figure it out?\u201d\u201cBecause the Tower never gives impossible tasks. Even if it was the twentieth trial, I thought that it was far too high a difficulty for the 1st Floor.\u201dYuWon pointed to his crimson eyes.\u201cSo after looking carefully, I found the answer.\u201dCrimson eyes. After looking at them up close, she remembered seeing those exact same eyes in the past.It was approximately 1,000 years ago. She was the test examiner on the 1st Floor back then as well when she was presented a great surprise by a player.The skill that symbolized the High Ranker Son OhGong.\u201c\u2026 Are those the Golden Cinder Eyes?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re not golden quite yet.\u201d[Cinder Eyes] and [Gigantification.] A player capable of using the skills of two High Rankers from two of the biggest guilds. She was certain he must have some amazing backers. She was split between two possibilities, and with this, she was able to confirm her guess.\u201cSo you\u2019re from the Heavenly Realm.\u201dThe Heavenly Realm. Similar to Olympus, it was one of the top guilds that ruled the Tower. And though it wasn\u2019t any longer, at one point, it was the guild of Son OhGong.\u201cOr are you a successor of the Great Sage? Either way, that answers a few of my questions.\u201dShuri was nodding her head.YuWon decided to let her keep her misunderstanding as there was no reason to clear this up with a complicated explanation.\u2018Besides, she won\u2019t even be able to tell anyone what happened here.\u2019Confirming his thoughts, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Test examiners aren\u2019t allowed to tell anyone the contents of a test or any information on the participating players. So there\u2019s no way anyone will find out about you.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201d\u201cAlso\u2026\u201dShuri unfastened one of the many swords on her and handed it to YuWon.\u201cThis is a bonus reward from the Administrator for this test.\u201dA sword with a red handle and a silver scabbard.It was a reward, so YuWon took it.\u201cYou mean this sword is a reward?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s something that the Administrator handed me when I first became a test examiner. I was told to give it as a reward to any player that clears all the trials, but I honestly never thought the day would come.\u201dThat was to be expected. Who in their right mind would think that a 1st Floor player could be capable of defeating one of Orochi\u2019s heads?But thanks to YuWon, Shuri was finally able to take one of the many swords off her person.\u201cCheck it out. Even I don\u2019t know what that thing actually is.\u201dYuWon unsheathed the sword to see it with his own eyes. As it was freed from its scabbard, it started to unleash a surprising mana. However\u2026\u201cHuh?\u201dWeirdly enough, the sword was broken in half.\u201cWait, is this thing defective?\u201dEven the test examiner was stumped by the sword.YuWon looked at his reflection off the blade that was perfectly broken in half.The blade of the sword had a gentle blue hue.YuWon smiled faintly.\u2018So this thing was here.\u2019* * *[Totsuka no Tsurugi \u2013 Fragment]\u15cc It is a fragment of the sword used by Susanoo long ago to seal \u300aYamata no Orochi.\u300b There is a special power sealed inside it.\u15cc It is currently in a broken state. You need to collect the remaining fragment to recover its original power.The effect of the item was laughable. Broken in half, you couldn\u2019t even call it a real sword. A sword was a weapon meant for slashing and stabbing, but a broken sword could do neither very effectively due to its short length.However, that didn\u2019t matter. YuWon had already procured a sword to use, and the fragment of \u300cTotsuka no Tsurugi\u300d wasn\u2019t meant to be an item for slashing and stabbing.\u2018It is a key to obtain one of the Three Sacred Treasures, the Kusanagi no Tsurugi.\u2019The \u300cTotsuka no Tsurugi\u300d was originally an item that YuWon was supposed to obtain by fighting the \u201cThree Precious Children.\u201d So having obtained half of the item here meant that his plan just became easier.\u201cIf you are unsatisfied with the reward, just tell me. Even if it takes some time, I\u2019ll put in a request with the Administrator\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dClick\u2014YuWon put the sword back in its scabbard and put it in his inventory. He wouldn\u2019t be needing that item for a while.\u201cThis will be plenty.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis was far better than a mediocre item that was only usable on the lower floors. And since he knew where to obtain the other fragment, it wasn\u2019t a difficult item to use.Also, this was only the bonus prize for clearing all the trials of the Colosseum. The real prize still remained.[You have cleared all the trials of the 1st Floor test.][You have obtained 20000 points.][All your stats increased by 2.][You have obtained \u300cTotsuka no Tsurugi \u2013 Fragment.\u300d][You have obtained \u300cOrochi\u2019s 7th Heart.\u300d][Would you like to move onto the next floor?]Two points for every single stat. A total of ten stat points were given as a reward. For someone like YuWon who desired his stats to be well rounded, this was a reward as sweet as honey. With this, Strength, his highest stat, had reached 80.Also, he was given \u300cOrochi\u2019s 7th heart.\u300dYuWon looked at the ruby-colored gem in his hand.This was Orochi\u2019s heart. A miniscule heart compared to its giant size. That meant that \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart\u300d was an item with that much condensed power.[Orochi\u2019s 7th Heart]\u15cc It is the 7th heart of Orochi, which was separated after being sealed by Susanoo.\u15cc It possesses a powerful poison.Unlike the \u300cGiant\u2019s Heart,\u300d \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart\u300d couldn\u2019t be consumed by any normal means. Orochi\u2019s blood carried poison, and the heart was condensed with the most lethal poison in its body.It was an item that he couldn\u2019t use right now, but if he could somehow neutralize the poison, it would be one of the greatest elixirs ever.\u201cOrochi\u2019s Heart\u2026 I kind of half expected it, but it actually gave it to you as a reward.\u201dShuri couldn\u2019t help but be a little envious. \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart\u300d was an elixir that even High Rankers desired. It was so valuable that it was hard to put a price tag on the item.\u201cCongrats. Let me give you a piece of advice. Don\u2019t just consume it.\u201dIt seemed that Shuri had felt bad about the reward she gave YuWon. Which wasn\u2019t all that surprising since, compared to \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart,\u300d nothing should be known about the fragment of \u300cTotsuka no Tsurugi.\u300d\u201cThank you for the advice.\u201dAfter this, YuWon had intended to leave the 1st Floor since he had obtained his reward, so there was no more reason to remain here. Yet\u2026Vwoom, vwoom\u2014Vwoooom\u2014[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d is reacting.][\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d expresses hunger.]Out of nowhere, the egg started letting out a cry.\u2018So suddenly?\u2019Despite it crying out in hunger, there was nothing YuWon could do since he knew nothing about the egg.Normal eggs hatched simply by incubating them, but this egg didn\u2019t do that.An egg that expressed hunger\u2026 YuWon had never once heard of an egg like that.[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d shows its form.]The egg was going to show its form?YuWon checked his inventory, which showed no reaction. The egg was definitely still safely inside his inventory.But then\u2026\u201cW-What in the\u2026?\u201dThe first one to notice that something was off was Shuri. She readied her sword and activated her mana.YuWon looked around to see what was up and felt a chill down his spine.Gnaw\u2014Crunch, crunch\u2014The Colosseum was enveloped in darkness. And within the darkness appeared dozens of half-opened eyes and not fully grown teeth.\u201cDid a monster break into the Colosseum?\u201d Shuri wondered.She stayed on guard against the monster that had suddenly appeared in the testing arena.She found this bizarre. This was the testing arena, a place protected by the power of the Tower. She had worked here as the test examiner of the 1st Floor for thousands of years, yet this was the first time a being from the outside had intruded into the testing arena.Shuri decided to leave the thinking for later. For now, she had to prioritize bringing order to the testing arena as the test examiner.Shing\u2014She tried to cut down the mysterious being by swinging her sword.\u201cWait!\u201dHearing YuWon\u2019s voice, she stopped and turned her head.\u201c\u2026 Please give me a minute.\u201dYuWon stopped Shuri and looked at the strange thing that had appeared in the arena.He was sure that these eyes and teeth didn\u2019t come from the outside. Instead, it was\u2026[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d has started feasting on \u2018Orochi\u2019s 7th Head.\u2019]\u2026 The \u2018Egg\u2019 that YuWon possessed.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 49Crunch, munch\u2014The feast was quick.The dozens of giant teeth easily pierced Orochi\u2019s skin and scales. As if it was made of tofu, the body dissolved as soon as it touched the teeth.Shuri stopped staring at the thing and asked YuWon, \u201cIs this\u2026 another one of your abilities?\u201dShe didn\u2019t particularly feel any special mana or killing intent from the thing that was eating Orochi\u2019s corpse. She wouldn\u2019t have found it that much of a threat if not for the sight she was seeing. In fact, it made her even more on guard against the thing.Shuri had become a Ranker through endless patience and hard work, eventually gaining the trust of the Administrator and becoming a test examiner. She was a being that had lived for almost ten thousand years now.In contrast to her beautiful, youthful appearance, she was one of the older beings among the Rankers. And in that extremely long time, she had never seen a creature like this.\u201cIt\u2019s something similar-like.\u201d\u201cIt either is or isn\u2019t. Or it\u2019s similar or not similar. What do you mean by \u2018similar-like\u2019?\u201cI\u2019m honestly not sure.\u201dYuWon\u2019s answer made Shuri furrow her brows as she stared at the slowly disappearing Orochi carcass.Anyway, now that YuWon had stopped her, she could no longer attack that thing. The one who defeated Orochi in the trial was YuWon, so the right for what to do with its corpse also laid with YuWon.Nom, nom\u2014The meal was now over.YuWon asked the eyes that had now grown ever so slightly larger, \u201cAre you full now?\u201d[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d nods its head.][\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d has started singing.]Despite looking like a horrifying monstrosity, it replied like it was a child.The message relayed the Egg\u2019s voice, which confirmed to Yuwon that this thing was indeed the very same Egg that he owned.\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s all fine then.\u201dFssss\u2014Ssk\u2014The darkness dissipated like a fading fog, and the eyes started disappearing. The final eyes to disappear had its eyes closed, as if it was content.Yuwon checked the egg in his inventory. It was only by a little bit, but it had grown visibly larger.[?\u2019s Egg]\u15cc It is ?\u2019s egg. There is no way to know whose egg it is, what will come out of the egg, or how to make it hatch.\u15cc Incubation rate : 13.58%The frozen incubation rate had suddenly shot up.Since he hadn\u2019t even known where to get started, YuWon had half-given up on it, but now he had obtained a clue.\u201cYou have an idea as to what it is now?\u201dNow that the chaos was over, Shuri came closer and asked Yuwon.Yuwon nodded his head and answered, \u201cYes, a little bit.\u201d\u201c\u2018A little bit,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dHe meant that he didn\u2019t know everything.Shuri looked around the once again peaceful Colosseum. It was now quiet, but it felt as if a storm had swept through.She, a Ranker who had lived for almost ten thousand years, couldn\u2019t comprehend a mere 1st Floor player.Shuri\u2019s head was full of thoughts.She looked back at YuWon.\u201cHonestly, I thought you were going to be the next Son OhGong.\u201dIt was an incredible compliment to be compared to the High Ranker Son OhGong. On top of that, she had thought YuWon was his successor. But she had more to say\u2026\u201cBut now\u2026 I\u2019m honestly not sure.\u201dThe Heavenly Realm and \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal.\u201dThe final ability that YuWon demonstrated made it hard for her to connect YuWon to the two. There was no way that the Heavenly Realm would be hiding such a sinister power.\u201cYou seem to have a lot of secrets, so I promise not to share any of what went on here. Not that I have any intentions to do so, nor am I able to.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d\u201cI hope to hear news about you from a much higher place.\u201dShuri reached out her hand to YuWon.YuWon quietly looked at her hand.\u2018She\u2019s still the same as always.\u2019Shuri long had a habit of saying farewell to all participants that passed the test.She was inflexible but just, as well as a beautiful and strong warrior.YuWon was reminded of the sight of her losing her life in the final fight.He took her hand and responded to her properly.\u201cIt was nice meeting you.\u201d* * *Among the first ten floors, the Colosseum\u2019s test was famous for being an accurate measure of a new player\u2019s abilities. Divided into twenty trials, every trial increased significantly in difficulty. And according to how many rounds you completed, you got a ranking.Most average players that moved onto the 2nd Floor barely manage to clear the second trial. Players with some skill managed to clear up to around the fifth trial. And anyone who managed to clear beyond the tenth trial was considered to have the qualities fit for a Ranker.And among this Colosseum\u2019s rankings\u2026[1st : Son OhGong \u2013 Round 19]Son OhGong\u2019s record seemed unbreakable.The greatest being when it came to \u2018fighting.\u2019 A Ranker known to rule the heavens, wielding an infinitely extending staff and manipulating thunder and clouds.That Son OhGong\u2019s record was finally broken after roughly a thousand years.[1st : Kim YuWon \u2013 Round 20]Kim YuWon. The new player that completely rewrote the Tutorial\u2019s record. On top of having a flashy debut, he ended up inscribing another new record in the Tower.There were some who were surprised, but there were also those who weren\u2019t.If one was capable of topping the records, of course they\u2019d be capable of doing it again.However, one thing was for sure now.\u201cAn incredible guy entered the Tower.\u201dYuWon\u2019s Tutorial record wasn\u2019t a coincidence or some special luck.\u201cA new super rookie.\u201d\u201cHe might become a Ranker in only a few decades.\u201d\u201cWe got another monster like Son OhGong?\u201d\u201cIs he a Pure-Blood? Where is he from?\u201d\u201cEarth? Where\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cIs there anyone that knows?\u201dVarious Rankers, players, and guilds that weren\u2019t interested in him till now finally learned his name.Kim YuWon. A star candidate to decorate the sky of the Tower had appeared.* * *A month had passed.Hephaestus turned his head after noticing the presence that entered his workshop.\u201cSo, you\u2019re here.\u201dYuWon had come to pay a visit.Nodding his head, YuWon spoke in a manner as if Hephaestus owed him money.\u201cI came to grab the thing I left with you.\u201d\u201cWatch your tone. You\u2019re not even paying me a single point. Wait right there. It\u2019s almost finished.\u201dYuWon sat next to the hot furnace, waiting for Hephaestus to finish crafting. As usual, Hephaestus was repeating the process of hammering and quenching.The workshop was hot. Like, really, really hot. So much so that normal players wouldn\u2019t have been able to stand it. This place wasn\u2019t the previous old, shabby workshop with a weak furnace.Tshhh\u2014After hammering the armor that had been heated up, Hephaestus dipped it in cold water.There were beads of sweat raining down his forehead from swinging his heavy hammer nonstop.He turned around to look at YuWon.\u2018Huh?\u2019 wondered Hephaestus.Something was off. YuWon wasn\u2019t sweating. He may not have been inside the workshop for long, but this was still highly unusual.\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you hot?\u201dYuWon shrugged his shoulders.\u201cI am hot.\u201dContrary to his reply, YuWon wasn\u2019t sweating at all.There were some people who naturally didn\u2019t sweat regardless of the temperature, but with this much heat, he should at least have found it discomforting.Hephaestus looked at YuWon with fascination. He wondered how high YuWon\u2019s fire resistance must have been.After observing him for a bit, Hephaestus asked YuWon a question while wiping his sweat with a towel he had hanging by his side.\u201cSo is the 10th Floor next?\u201d\u201cYes. I just came down after clearing the test.\u201d\u201cThis one took you quite a bit of time. What was it, ten days?\u201dTen days. It was time it took for YuWon to clear the 9th Floor\u2019s test.In twenty days, YuWon had cleared all the way up to the 8th Floor\u2019s test, and he had finally reached the 9th Floor.For how quickly he\u2019d ascended, the 9th Floor\u2019s test had taken him a good amount of time.\u201cYou know what the 9th Floor\u2019s test is like.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, so I\u2019m a bit fuzzy on it, but I think it was finding your way through a labyrinth?\u201dThe Labyrinth. That was the test given by the Tower on the 9th Floor. It was a test where you had to find your way through an endless maze with hundreds of paths, using a wide variety of methods.\u201cStill, isn\u2019t ten days too long?\u201dFor most skilled players, making it through the Labyrinth usually only took four to five days max. So ten days was actually quite a bit of time. Any player other than YuWon would have been rated as unskilled if they had taken that long.\u201cDid something happen?\u201dYuWon rolled his eyes at Hephaestus\u2019s curiosity-filled question.Seeing his reaction, Hephaestus smirked, having already known that something must have happened.\u201cTell me already, if you want to receive the thing you commissioned.\u201d\u201cAre you holding an item hostage?\u201d\u201cNow.\u201d Hephaestus egged him on.Since he hadn\u2019t actually intended on keeping it a secret, YuWon opened up.\u201cI established a new path. It took me a bit of time to find them.\u201dA new path. Hearing that made Hephaestus narrow his eyes.\u201c\u2026 In the Labyrinth?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like it had a predetermined path. So what do you mean by \u2018a new path\u2019?\u201dHephaestus didn\u2019t understand what YuWon was going on about. The Labyrinth was called a labyrinth because there wasn\u2019t a set path. Not only was it extremely large, but some people ended up getting lost for a long time and even giving up on the test.So to claim that he established a path in that Labyrinth\u2026Also\u2026\u201cDid you just say \u2018them\u2019?\u201dYuWon spoke as if the new path wasn\u2019t singular, but plural. This intensified Hephaestus\u2019s curiosity.\u201cThere\u2019s no reason there had to only be a single exit. There could be one path, but there could also be a myriad.\u201d\u201cAre you saying you created them?\u201d\u201cYes. They were just never actually treaded on. None of them were ever the wrong paths.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of nonsense are you spouting here\u2026?\u201dHephaestus ended up speechless from how baffled he was. There was nothing he could learn by continuing to ask questions. He may not know how YuWon created the exits, but this was completely unrelated to him.Hephaestus was a Ranker. He had long ago escaped the Labyrinth, cleared that test, and climbed the Tower already. Nothing good could come from intervening anymore with the matters of a lower floor.\u201cSo you just made things easy for the following guys.\u201dHe said it like that because he was bad at compliments, but Hephaestus knew what establishing a new path meant.The Tower not only calculated the reward based on \u2018first\u2019 and \u2018perfect,\u2019 but a number of other factors as well were involved in the test. That meant that if you went through a predetermined path, you could easily clear the test, but it would net you a lesser reward.On the other hand, YuWon had just cleared the test by establishing a never-before pioneered path. So naturally, his reward had to be better than a standard reward.\u201cI\u2019m now dying to know how you\u2019ll clear the other tests.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll come back again and tell you.\u201d\u201cSo is this thing something you need for the next test?\u201dHephaestus grabbed the sword he had hung up haphazardly on one side.\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of weapons, but I\u2019ve never made anything like this before. A weapon that, instead of having excellent mana conductivity\u2026\u201dShing\u2014The sword was pulled out of its scabbard.Hephaestus\u2019s eyes sparkled while staring at the crappy weapon made from various impure materials.\u201c\u2026 Has the worst mana conductivity possible.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: 50YuWon took the sword from Hephaestus.The sword had a hazy-colored blade. The weight was appropriate, and the shape and the balance of the sword was also good. The only shortcoming was, as Hephaestus said, its terrible mana conductivity.[Nameless Sword]\u15cc It\u2019s a sword made from various materials. Its mana conductivity is terrible, but the blade is well-sharpened. It could be useful for butchering.It was an object that was hard to even call an item.Even when made of normal steel, an item was capable of accepting some amount of mana. And as long as Hephaestus put his effort into it, he could make a pretty excellent sword just out of plain steel.However, the sword in YuWon\u2019s hand was not like that.\u201cThe materials in that are normally used to make armor, rather than weapons. Bad mana conductivity also means that it has strong resistance against mana.\u201dThat meant that this was a weapon that was intentionally designed to have bad mana conductivity.\u201cIf making a failed work is a success, then I can guarantee that I\u2019ve succeeded pretty fantastically.\u201dIt was the greatest failure. That\u2019s why Hephaestus was able to say he had succeeded.To try it out, YuWon tried imbuing the sword with some mana.[Activating Arcane Sword.][Failed to activate Arcane Sword.][An unknown power is blocking mana.]Whirr\u2014The sword vibrated ever so slightly.The mana that YuWon had imbued into the sword had become trapped, unable to get outside. And then the sword absorbed his mana like a sponge.The skill had failed. YuWon was sure. This piece of work was a failure, the greatest failure at that.\u201cI like it.\u201dShing\u2014YuWon put the sword back in its scabbard.It was much better than he had expected. He had thought that at best the skill\u2019s effect would be drastically reduced, but for it to completely stop the skill\u2026If this was made into armor, it would have been pretty powerful armor with great mana resistance.\u2018Fael, tar, obsidian, and onyx steel. He really only used minerals that are used to make armor.\u2019YuWon was not a blacksmith. However, after he had become a Ranker and started fighting the Outer Gods, he had touched and used countless different items. Thanks to that, he possessed some knowledge on what materials were combined to make certain items.As for this item, it was less of a sword and more like armor in the shape of a sword.\u201cI got to have a fun challenge. It never even occurred to me to make something like this.\u201dThat was a no-brainer as Hephaestus had only ever made perfect items.Making a sword with the worst qualities using high quality materials was something he hadn\u2019t done even when he had first started wielding his hammer.YuWon gave a total of 10,000 points in Asgardian bills to Hephaestus.Setting aside its properties, the materials in this item had that much value, not to mention the fact that this was something crafted by Hephaestus.Hephaestus tried to reject his payment, but YuWon insisted. He had let himself get used to free stuff.\u2018That should do it for preparations.\u2019The 10th Floor.It was the first wall that stopped players who decided to climb the Tower after finishing the Tutorial.The Tower\u2019s tests became significantly more difficult every tenth floor. So players referred to parts like the 10th and 20th Floors as \u2018walls.\u2019Of course, this was completely unrelated to YuWon. YuWon was too far above the average player to feel like he had hit a wall from something like this.YuWon found a portal near the workshop.For 10p and having the qualifications of clearing the previous floor\u2019s test, one could teleport to another floor by using the portals.[Please select your destination.]\u201c10th Floor.\u201dIt was the world that he had just obtained the qualifications to go up to.\u201cI\u2019m headed to the Martial Realm.\u201d[Qualification confirmed.][Teleporting to the 10th Floor.]Flash\u2014!Before YuWon\u2019s eyes, the Martial Realm opened up.* * *The Martial Realm was the name given to the world of the 10th Floor. And among the many floors in the Tower, it was one of YuWon\u2019s favorite worlds. It was a giant continent surrounded by the ocean.In this place was a martial arts society created by the strong.[WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF THE 10TH FLOOR.][THE TEST WILL NOW START.][Please select a martial arts school to join.][Please pass the test of the chosen martial arts school.]Unlike other floors, the 10th Floor\u2019s test started as soon as you entered. The test was to pick among the thousands of martial schools, learn their martial arts, and pass that school\u2019s test.In other words, this was a test of training.On this floor, you couldn\u2019t pass the test by simply taking down an enemy or doing a special mission. The only choice you had was to learn the martial arts of the chosen school.Of course\u2026\u2018That\u2019s not the only way to pass the test.\u2019The area where YuWon arrived on the 10th Floor was crowded. There were countless people gathered around this empty field a hundred meters long.\u201cWe\u2019re recruiting people to join the School of the Dragon Sword! Anyone is welcome to join as long as they have passion!\u201d\u201cThe House of the Gentleman\u2019s Sword is recruiting people. If you are a fellow that uses the sword, please come to the House of the Gentleman\u2019s Sword!\u201d\u201cThe School of Heavy Steel is a place to train your body as hard as steel! There is no better martial art than ours to learn to climb the Tower!\u201dIt was like a market. There were players that were wandering around, unable to pick a school. A lot of mid-sized schools were shouting at the top of their lungs to attract those players.The big fish, however, were either not present, or if they were, they didn\u2019t cause a scene because players with a good eye knew how to find and recognize the true masters.That was when\u2026\u201cHello, young man.\u201d\u2026 Someone came up to YuWon with a soft voice.\u201cIs this your first time in the martial realm?\u201dIt was obvious what he was after.YuWon looked at the sword on the man\u2019s back. He seemed to be a player that had decided to settle down in the martial realm.Compared to other floors, quite a few players settled down in the martial realm. The reason was pretty simple: it was a nice place to live.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cHmm. Judging by your outfit, you must be pretty skilled. Do you, by chance, use the sword?\u201dWhen YuWon nodded in response, the man started making a big deal out of it.\u201cWhat a coincidence\u2026 Or perhaps, is this fate? If you are a sword user, then you must join our School of the Sapphire Sword. Our school is\u2026\u201dRather than a martial artist, his manner of speech was closer to that of a salesman. Compared to the past, the martial realm had changed greatly due to the arrival of players from many different worlds.YuWon just brushed off the man. The School of the Sapphire Sword? He had never heard of it before. Even for YuWon, who had a wide breadth of knowledge, it was impossible for him to know every single school in the martial realm when there were thousands of them.\u2018Major schools are probably uninterested in places like this.\u2019And even if they were, they wouldn\u2019t personally be seeking out people. A martial arts school with great martial arts and skills that had produced high-ranking Rankers would have people going in search of them. There was no need to act like a door-to-door salesman.That\u2019s why it was unlikely that one of the large martial schools would personally come for YuWon.\u2018I see that there are a few noble clan-level martial arts schools.\u2019YuWon paid no heed to the School of the Sapphire Sword. He let him continue on while observing the few people from the major schools.Wudang Sect, Azure Mountain Sect, Jaegal Clan. YuWon spotted some large martial schools that he remembered, but the one that he wanted wasn\u2019t present.\u201cThe founding of the School of the Sapphire Sword actually predates the Tower\u2026\u201d the man continued to blabber on.YuWon frowned as he looked at him. First off, he had absolutely zero intention of joining the School of Sapphire-whatever. It was possible to change your school midway, but he had no time to waste on a school like that one.\u2018Do they\u2026 not have any interest in places like this?\u2019Martial arts were the first real challenge faced by players who had been getting stronger from tests, rewards, and leveling up. This was a test where you had to become stronger by moving your body, hardening your body like steel, and practicing martial arts.As it was a completely different type of test than the previous ones, there were quite a few players who stagnated on the 10th Floor, unable to ever clear the test.\u201cThat\u2019s why the School of the Sapphire Sword\u2026 Are you listening to me?\u201dThe man who was excitedly explaining his school suddenly looked at YuWon with a frown. He realized that YuWon had stopped listening to him after a certain point.\u201cNo. I wasn\u2019t listening.\u201dThe man\u2019s face quickly hardened.\u201cIt seems you\u2019re bad at understanding.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t have any intention of joining your school. Just go away.\u201dYuWon planned on walking away, but\u2026\u201cDid you just look down on me? And my School of the Sapphire Sword?\u201d\u2026 The man had a volatile reaction.YuWon scratched his head. He wondered why he was being so sensitive over something that wasn\u2019t that big of a deal.\u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention, but\u2026\u201dAfter thinking for a second, YuWon shook his head in annoyance. He didn\u2019t really care to make excuses.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong.\u201d\u201cGrrr!\u201dAs if his pride was hurt, the man stared at YuWon while gritting his teeth. His face was flushed red with anger. He pointed his finger at YuWon.\u201cYou look like a scarecrow. Don\u2019t just say whatever you want when you clearly got here by luck.\u201dYuWon couldn\u2019t believe he was just called a scarecrow.The man had a pretty big frame. YuWon was on the tall side, but this man was about 10cm taller.YuWon thought this guy should have known that fighting wasn\u2019t just about size if he had managed to reach at least the 10th Floor and mastered martial arts.\u201cDon\u2019t you know how great our School of the Sapphire Sword is?!\u201dThe man walked towards YuWon while trying to create a dominating atmosphere.It seemed as though he wasn\u2019t completely a small fry. The man released the power he was hiding, sending killing intent at YuWon.He might not have been intending to kill YuWon, but he definitely wanted to scare him and pick a fight.\u2018There\u2019s no way he\u2019s actually this angry from that\u2026\u2019This was a pretty old-fashioned tactic.\u2018Picking a fight and demonstrating your strength to a player that\u2019s new to the 10th Floor. It\u2019s not a bad way for a small school to show off their skills.\u2019It seemed as though YuWon had been highly underestimated. He felt like he got caught up in something annoying. He had to hurry since the school he wanted wasn\u2019t here, yet here was a school he had never heard of picking a fight with him.\u201cI don\u2019t know what floor you\u2019ve been up to, but aren\u2019t you afraid of the penalty? Also, it won\u2019t be good for your school if this incident becomes well-known.\u201dAmong the many schools on the 10th Floor, there was an official rule: to not mess with players that had just reached the 10th Floor.This was a long-held tradition after the Martial Realm was settled in the Tower. And any school that broke that rule was always punished.The school was either directly punished by the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance, or they became unable to recruit additional players from losing their reputation. Either way, it was taboo for a martial school to mess with a newly arrived player.\u201cHmph! That is the case, but there are still rules in the martial realm. I can\u2019t let my school\u2019s name be tarnished. Now, it\u2019s too late for you to beg\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201dStep\u2014The man stopped speaking mid-sentence as YuWon took a step towards him.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to settle this with words, I\u2019m not interested.\u201dOnce was enough for trying to talk it out.The look in YuWon\u2019s eyes changed.The man sensed a chilling feeling between the distance that was closing between them. After looking YuWon in the eyes, he took a step back without even realizing it.\u2018How can his eyes\u2026\u2019He thought that YuWon should have been a player that had just arrived on the 10th Floor, but his eyes were like that of a Ranker he once saw from a distance.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d YuWon asked.The man\u2019s nerves were on edge while he looked at YuWon.YuWon whispered, \u201cCome at me.\u201dStep\u2014YuWon took another step closer to the man.The two now stood at less than a palm\u2019s length between them.\u201cNgh\u2014!\u201dWhoosh\u2014!Scared, the man from the School of the Sapphire Sword swung his hand at YuWon.Wham\u2014!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Leveling with the Gods Chapter 51The School of the Sapphire Sword earned its name because its sword was as pure as a clear sky. They might not have been a part of the noble clans, but they were definitely not a small, weak school. Instead, it was a mid-sized school that had hundreds of martial arts masters.That\u2019s why Yang Wonil was proud to be a part of the School of the Sapphire Sword.\u201cBring in ten outsiders in ten days, or you\u2019ll be kicked out of the school.\u201dThat was the punishment Wonil received from the head of the School of the Sapphire Sword. It was for having caused a fight within the school and crippling a fellow martial artist.To be honest, compared to his misdeed, it was a fairly light punishment. As long as he could recruit ten outsiders, he would be forgiven.The problem was that recruiting ten people was no easy task.\u2018How am I supposed to bring in ten people in just ten days?!\u2019In the current martial realm, a school\u2019s authority changed depending on how many players they had.If a player went through a certain school, climbed up the Tower, and became a Ranker, that would naturally raise the reputation of the school and bring in more students. That\u2019s why martial schools couldn\u2019t help but put in a considerable amount of effort in recruiting players.\u2018No matter what\u2026\u2019AdvertisementsWonil resolved himself as he set out to recruit players.Getting a job at a mid-sized school like the School of the Sapphire Sword was no easy task. It had taken Wonil a lot of effort to finally settle down on the 10th Floor. He couldn\u2019t get kicked out like this.He had never done anything else in his life other than swing swords, but he was prepared to do anything\u2014even if that meant using force if words didn\u2019t work.The level of players that arrived on the 10th Floor was pretty clear-cut. There was the problem with stacking penalties, but he was a lower floor player that had only managed to climb up to the 15th Floor. He wouldn\u2019t have to worry about the penalty once he recruited ten people.Or that\u2019s how things should have gone\u2026\u2018Huh\u2026?\u2019His eyes spun, and time seemed to move slower. Before he knew it, Wonil was sprawled out on the ground.He didn\u2019t know what happened. He was sure that he had swung first, but he must have passed out for a moment.When he came to, he noticed the gaze of the crowd staring at him.\u201cGasp!\u201dWonil stood up in surprise, but his legs gave out on him, and he flopped back down onto the ground.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that Yang Wonil?\u201d\u201cYang Wonil?\u201d\u201cThe embarrassment of the School of the Sapphire Sword. I heard he caused some trouble recently, so why is he here?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the head of Sapphire Sword greedy for outsiders? He was probably told to recruit them as a punishment.\u201d\u201cBut why is he like that on the ground?\u201d\u201cWell, from what I saw earlier\u2026\u201dWonil could hear the whispers of the crowd.He was ashamed to have ended up falling over in front of all these people.Wonil gathered strength in his legs and carefully got back up. He then started looking around for YuWon, but some amount of time must have passed because he was nowhere to be seen.\u2018Damn it!\u2019He clenched his fist.Wonil cut through the crowd, trying his best to appear unphased. He lowered his head and got out of there as fast as he could. In his mind, there was one fact that wouldn\u2019t leave.\u2018The next time we meet\u2026\u2019Killing intent filled Wonil\u2019s eyes.* * *Ten days had passed.After arriving on the 10th Floor, YuWon had continued to move on his feet without rest.He liked the Martial Realm, but this was certainly a problem. There were no good methods of transportation here. There was no advanced magic or magical creatures that made moving around easier. So there was no choice but to run around on his own two feet.\u201cIt\u2019s so far.\u201dTen days. That wasn\u2019t a short period of time. And in that time, YuWon had traversed over 4,000km.* From Martial City, the starting area of the 10th Floor located in the northern region, all the way to Mt. Heaven in the western region. Due to the distance, no matter how fast YuWon was, it still took him time.*PR/N: about 2,485.5 miles\u2018So this is Mt. Heaven.\u2019Before his eyes was a great mountain and a clear, blue sky. It was easy to stare out into the overwhelming magnificence of nature.YuWon got moving again.Around the time he managed to climb halfway up the mountain, the sun had started to set.Rustle\u2014On edge and alert, YuWon heard the rustling of the leaves.He turned his head. There was a large group of people gathered up.\u201cWho are you?\u201dA voice filled with caution.In order to hide their location, the voice was transferred to him through mana that echoed throughout the forest. There was only a single voice, but YuWon could sense the presence of more than just one person.On the mountain, the sun set quickly. It had now become dark, and YuWon used [Cinder Eyes] in the darkness.\u2018There\u2019s roughly twenty of them.\u2019The number of people was an issue, but also each of them was fairly skilled.As expected of Mt. Heaven. This place was riddled with monstrous people.\u201cPlease don\u2019t be on such high alert. I am not an enemy.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t seem lost. You do know what kind of place this is, right?\u201dThat was the question YuWon was waiting for.He looked towards the owner of the voice that was observing him in the woods, and he replied, \u201cIs this not the home of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, located on Mt. Heaven of the western region?\u201dThe two locked eyes, and right as he responded, twenty people revealed themselves.Shhk, shwoo\u2014Ssk, sssk\u2014The twenty people surrounded YuWon.YuWon remembered something similar happening to him. It was like when he was surrounded by a group of Jackals right after entering the Tower. However, this was a very different situation.\u2018Jackals can\u2019t even begin to be compared to them.\u2019The Heavenly Demonic Cult was a group that had long been facing off against the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance. Currently they were unable to leave Mt. Heaven, but if you looked at the strength of each school individually, the Heavenly Demonic Cult could have been considered the greatest martial arts school.And these people here were the members of that same Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cSo you did your research before coming.\u201dA martial artist from the Heavenly Demonic Cult looked YuWon up and down. It was probably to take into consideration things like his clothes, weapons, and the energy he radiated.The atmosphere and energy that YuWon radiated wasn\u2019t all that bad.The martial artist nodded his head at YuWon\u2019s visit.\u201cSo, do you desire to join our cult?\u201dIt was obvious the reason why a player would seek out the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Unless one was absolutely crazy, no one would ever come here to pick a fight.It was a case where everyone who came here came to make the Cult their home. And the Heavenly Demonic Cult was very picky about the players that wanted to join.\u201cWhat floor player are you? If you want to join the Cult, tell us your floor, name, and show us your skills\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201dYuWon shook his head. He did have business with the Heavenly Demonic Cult, but he had no intention of becoming a permanent member. The thought of giving up climbing the Tower to settle down on the 10th Floor like the other martial artists here had never even crossed his mind.YuWon could have said that clearly, but he knew that this wasn\u2019t something to say to the plain martial artist in front of him.There was a \u2018much bigger gaze\u2019 that had been looking at him since earlier. YuWon looked towards that gaze and spoke.\u201cI, player Kim YuWon, wish to take the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.\u201dAs soon as he said that\u2026[The Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test will now start.]The test began.* * *The day quickly became dark. Due to how tall the mountain was, the sun was up for a shorter period of time.YuWon climbed up the mountain with the martial artists of the Demonic Cult.Tmp, tmp\u2014The mountain was tranquil. The sounds of people stepping on leaves could be heard clearly.The head of this group, Gwang HaMuk, decided to break the silence.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since a player wanted to take the Cult\u2019s test.\u201dGwang HaMuk was a player who had climbed beyond the 40th Floor. He was skilled enough to be in charge of his own unit.\u201cSeeing as how you came all the way here, you already know, right? The reason why players avoid the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it because the passing rate is low?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong.\u201dHaMuk shook his head while smiling faintly.\u201cIt\u2019s not because it\u2019s low, but because it\u2019s impossible.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThere has not been a single player to ever pass the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test. That\u2019s how the unspoken rule has come to be\u2014to never take the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.\u201dHaMuk looked over at YuWon.\u201cBut maybe you\u2019ll be different.\u201dThere was not a single person in the Martial Realm that didn\u2019t know of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. There were two reasons for this. The first was that the Cult possessed enough power to be considered the greatest martial arts school. The second was because no player had ever managed to pass the Cult\u2019s test.\u2018Which is why their forces are slowly growing weaker.\u2019A martial arts school incapable of recruiting new players. That\u2019s why the only way the Demonic Cult could increase their forces was to accept players that descended from higher floors.That was the reason why Mt. Heaven was so quiet.Long ago, the Heavenly Demonic Cult had so many men that it occupied the entirety of this enormous mountain.\u201cIt\u2019s this way.\u201dShwooo\u2014While following behind HaMuk, a sinister mana started to envelope YuWon\u2019s body.[You have entered a barrier.][You try to resist the effects of the barrier.][You have failed to resist the effects.][If you go off the predetermined path, you will fall under the status effect : Hallucination.]A barrier. Compared to the Jaegal Clan, known to have the most powerful barriers, the Cult\u2019s barrier wasn\u2019t as strong, but it was still impressive.The path in front of him now looked completely different. There were dozens of different paths, and one had to find the true path among them. If one accidentally stepped on the wrong path, they would fall under the barrier\u2019s hallucination, as the message warned.\u201cIf you take even a single wrong step, you\u2019ll be completely lost. Except for the Heavenly Demon, no one will be able find you, so be careful and follow\u2026\u201dHaMuk turned his head to warn YuWon only to stop talking. His eyes widened.YuWon was gone.HaMuk could have sworn that he was there until a moment ago, but now\u2026 he was gone.\u201cW-Where did he\u2026?\u201dHaMuk\u2019s head scanned back and forth. The entire area was the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s barrier. And if he disappeared inside here\u2026\u201cFuck.\u201d\u2026 YuWon might become unable to ever find his way out.* * *Tmp\u2014YuWon walked without hesitation.As he walked down a path, another crossroad appeared. Among the dozens of paths, YuWon picked a single one and continued on.[Cinder Eyes]His red eyes let him see through the illusion created by the barrier.The barrier was honestly not that amazing. They might be the Heavenly Demonic Cult, but they were still a part of the 10th Floor\u2019s world. [Cinder Eyes] wasn\u2019t some half-baked skill that couldn\u2019t even see through this place\u2019s barrier.\u2018How far does this go?\u2019The path stretched out pretty far.He\u2019d had to choose a path over ten times now, but every time, YuWon managed to pick the true path and not a fake one created by the barrier.30 minutes had passed since he\u2019d started walking through the barrier. It was about time for him to see the end\u2026Ssk\u2014\u2026 The end of the chosen path.Once again YuWon came to a crossroad, which brought him to a stop. This crossroad was different from the other ones.\u2018There are two paths.\u2019Both paths were real and not fake.YuWon wondered which one to pick.In the end, he decided to trust his instincts. Regardless of his choice, he wouldn\u2019t fall under the hallucination of the barrier. So he picked the left path.However, his choice wasn\u2019t based entirely on instinct. There was also the \u2018wind.\u2019Tmp\u2014With every step, the scenery around him changed. The thick dense forest grew further away, and a small room revealed itself.The room was quiet and simple with a single candle lighting the room. And in the middle of the room was someone sitting down with his back facing YuWon.Advertisements\u201cSo you\u2019ve come.\u201dA low, thick voice.That\u2019s when\u2026[You have passed the Heavenly Demon\u2019s 1st test.]\u2026 The message he was waiting for popped up.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: 52\u2018The test of the Heavenly Demon, huh\u2026\u2019The content of the message had changed. It went from the \u201cHeavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test\u201d to the \u201cHeavenly Demon\u2019s test.\u201dA reclusive group, one that couldn\u2019t\u2014no, hadn\u2019t let a single player through to the next floor out of stubbornness or even obstinance, it was only natural that the Heavenly Demonic Cult became weaker as the ages passed. Yet despite that, the Martial Realm as a whole still considered the Demonic Cult as the greatest school of martial arts.It was all due to the existence of one man. The living legend of the Martial Realm. An ancient High Ranker who was alive even before the Martial Realm entered the Tower. The one synonymous with the Heavenly Demonic Cult, the Heavenly Demon.Fwoosh\u2014Wind blew inside the room, despite there being no open doors. The room became dark. Now all YuWon could see was the person\u2019s back.\u201cI shall ask you.\u201dThe man didn\u2019t turn around.That\u2019s when YuWon finally realized that this place must have been a different location than what he was seeing, that he must have been standing somewhere that wasn\u2019t actually this dinky little room.\u201cAt what point did you find out?\u201d the man asked.AdvertisementsYuWon had passed the test, so he wondered why he had prepared a meeting like this with him.\u201cIs that what you want to know?\u201d\u201cThis is also a test.\u201dThe Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test was just as rumored. Unlike the tests of the other schools, the Cult\u2019s test did not have a pre-set frame or rules.\u2018So this question is a part of the test, huh.\u2019The man was quite shameless.The system never lied. If this was a real test, he would have gotten a message that said the next test had started.But it didn\u2019t matter to YuWon whether this was a real test or not. It wasn\u2019t something he needed to keep secret.\u201cSince the beginning.\u201d\u201cThe beginning?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been observing me since before I even entered the barrier. That\u2019s when the test started.\u201dThe reason was simple.\u201cWhat kind of a test would only require me to follow someone?\u201dYuWon had heard plenty about the Cult\u2019s notoriety. The Demonic Cult that YuWon remembered was a group entirely about combat and battling. So there was no way that the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test, especially the Heavenly Demon\u2019s, would only require you to walk behind someone.\u201cSo you at least know how to find your way through properly.\u201dThere was a sense of satisfaction in the man\u2019s voice.Fsssh\u2014The scenery around YuWon started to fade. The dark room grew brighter, and the cramped room disappeared, revealing a view of the outside.The Heavenly Demon\u2019s back could no longer be seen.\u201cYou passed.\u201dYuWon could hear the voice inside his head.There was no message. The question just now wasn\u2019t registered separately as a test. It was simply a personal test by the Heavenly Demon.YuWon guessed that the Heavenly Demon would have treated him differently depending on his response.\u2018A \u2018pass\u2019 he says\u2026\u2019It seemed that he had managed to be seen a bit favorably, at the very least.\u2018I guess I\u2019m going to have a rough time for a bit, pleasing this ahjussi.\u2019YuWon looked at the torches that lined the street.There was a large village. Despite it being past sunset in the mountains, it was bustling with people.YuWon couldn\u2019t believe there was such a village deep in the mountains.\u2018So this is the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2019YuWon stood still for a second and took it in. There were people carrying rice and various grains, chickens, cows, pigs, and other livestock down the mountain, as well as martial artists armed with swords and spears.Some martial schools said that the devil lives in the Heavenly Demonic Cult. That was all baloney. YuWon knew a real devil.YuWon took in his surroundings. This was also a place where people lived, just like in the rest of the Martial Realm.While YuWon was taking a moment to admire the village\u2026\u201cY-You!\u201d HaMuk, who finally passed through the barrier, shouted after finding YuWon. \u201cHow are you here?\u201dHaMuk was quite surprised to find YuWon had come back in one piece after thinking that he\u2019d fallen prey to the barrier.YuWon thought about telling him the truth, that he had just met the Heavenly Demon. But the Heavenly Demon was the icon of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Nothing good would come from bringing him up, not to mention the fact that they hadn\u2019t even talked face-to-face.\u201cI just walked here first.\u201d\u201cYou walked?\u201dHaMuk\u2019s eyes widened. That meant that YuWon had managed to get through the barrier by himself.\u201cHow\u2026?\u201dThough the Cult might not have been known for having the strongest barrier, it should still have been impossible for a normal 10th Floor player to get through it on their own. Even HaMuk wasn\u2019t sure he could make his way through the barrier if he hadn\u2019t been taught the proper path.Yet here was YuWon, who had managed to cross the barrier faster than them, and they knew the right path. In other words, YuWon had crossed the barrier with ease.\u201cIs that important? I\u2019m tired, so let\u2019s go. Or does the Heavenly Demonic Cult not provide lodging to testees?\u201d YuWon spoke shamelessly before trudging along to the village.HaMuk was speechless as he watched YuWon walk away. He had now been a part of the cult for over 50 years, and in that time, not a single player had managed to cross the barrier by themself. In fact, he had never heard of a player doing such a thing, ever.* * *HaMuk ordered his subordinates to show YuWon to his lodgings. Then, he started looking into Kim YuWon.It was clear to him that YuWon was skilled. After confirming that he was a player that had just ascended to the 10th Floor by using the player kit , it was likely YuWon wasn\u2019t lying about his identity either.HaMuk figured that his name must have been somewhat well-known in the lower floors. He was sure that if he had his subordinates look into it, he\u2019d be able to find detailed information regarding YuWon\u2026\u201cReally?\u201d\u2026 But he didn\u2019t think it\u2019d be this easy.After giving the orders to a few of his men, HaMuk was able to learn about YuWon right away.\u201cYes. A few guilds from above are already trying to recruit Kim YuWon.\u201dThe Heavenly Demonic Cult had long stopped caring about the matters of the lower floors. Because of that, except for martial artists from the Cult that were active outside of Mt. Heaven or merchants that came to trade with them, they rarely heard information about the lower floors.This was the reason why HaMuk hadn\u2019t heard of YuWon.\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then the Martial Alliance must have already tried to approach him.\u201dThe Martial Alliance, formally known as the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance, was a mid-sized guild with many Rankers. As an alliance of various noble clans, it was a place with enough influence to possess an entire floor in the Tower.\u201cI\u2019ll have to look into it further, but it is likely.\u201d\u201cYet he came all the way here? Even though it\u2019s so far away?\u201d\u201cFrom what I heard, he passed all the tests of the previous floors with high marks. Seeing as how he even topped the 1st Floor Colosseum\u2019s rankings, he probably wants to set another record here as well.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s why he picked the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test was uncleared by any player thus far. The Heavenly Demon was stubborn, refusing to adjust the difficulty of his test, unlike the other martial schools. In addition, the Heavenly Demon was the one that gave the test and had such high standards that it was impossible for anyone to pass.\u201cI guess some people are just built differently.\u201dGwang HaMuk remembered the 1st Floor\u2019s Colosseum.Born inside the Cult, he was a Pure-Blood from the Heavenly Demonic Cult. So having mastered quite a lot of martial arts, he was able to easily make his way through the Tutorial.Normally, players with the innate talent to become Rankers were able to at least pass the tenth trial.Knowing this fact, the Colosseum\u2019s trials felt like hitting a wall to HaMuk. When he got to the seventh trial, he had felt his limits for the first time in his life. With martial arts and the power of the system, he thought he\u2019d be able to reach the top of the Tower in one go, but the Colosseum ended up completely shattering HaMuk\u2019s self-confidence.\u201cCaptain, have you ever taken our cult\u2019s test?\u201dHaMuk nodded his head at his subordinate\u2019s question.His loyalty to the Cult was exceptional. From a young age, he dreamed of one day becoming a player and passing the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.Unfortunately, he was unable to pass it. The Cult\u2019s test was a wall that was even taller and harder than the one he had faced during the Colosseum\u2019s trials.\u201cI have.\u201d\u201cHow was the test?\u201dHaMuk shook his head in response.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cI failed as soon as I started.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, sir\u2026?\u201dHis subordinate couldn\u2019t understand. Failing the test as soon as he had started?Seeing the subordinate waiting for an explanation, HaMuk decided to unravel his pent up frustrations.\u201cHe told me I didn\u2019t have the qualifications.\u201d* * *A hot, steaming bath was drawn.Once the female servants finished filling the tub with water, YuWon sent everyone out and immersed himself in the hot water.Shaaa\u2014As the bath overflowed, more steam rose to the top.\u201cHaah\u2014\u201dHe felt the fatigue from the 10-day-long journey melt away. His muscles loosened up as he closed his eyes inside the circular wooden tub for a moment.He indulged in the luxury for a few minutes. Then he opened his eyes and looked around.It was a small bathing area located outside.Just by looking at this place he could tell.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s small. Like, really small.\u201dWell, rather than being small, the Heavenly Demonic Cult wasn\u2019t affluent, which was inevitable.The current Heavenly Demonic Cult was behind the times. The recruitment of new players, revenue through collecting points from new recruits, and connections to the outside world from the players and Rankers trained by the Cult\u2026 There was none of that, and the Cult was simply a husk of its former glory.\u2018That ahjussi is so stubborn.\u2019So much could change by just slightly lowering the difficulty of the test.YuWon thought that he was the same as always.\u2018Though I\u2019m sure he has his reasons.\u2019The Tower\u2019s system never malfunctioned. This fact was true in all the Tower\u2019s long history, and it held true even in the distant future.The Tower also always gave a bigger reward the harder the test. That\u2019s why, when thinking about the 10th Floor, everyone came to the same conclusion.\u201cThe Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201cYep, it should be the Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201cThere really is no other option.\u201dDuring the meeting where they discussed what to do after the Tutorial, naturally the Heavenly Demonic Cult was brought up for the 10th Floor\u2019s test.\u201cThe Grand Martial Arts Tournament really is the jewel of the Martial Realm, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Grand Martial Arts Tournament is an attractive option. If you win, not only would you receive a Great Scarlet Medicine Ball, but you\u2019d be able to learn the best secret arts of the NamGung Clan, the Shaolin Temple, or wherever you want.\u201d\u201cBut is there even anyone here who hasn\u2019t managed to win the Grand Martial Arts Tournament?\u201d\u201c\u2026 Me.\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t either. Are you trying to pick a fight right now?\u201d\u2026 YuWon remembered that there was a bit of a commotion regarding that, making him let out a small laugh.It seemed that there had been a few present who either didn\u2019t know about the Tournament or had participated and didn\u2019t win.The one that had caused the biggest ruckus was Son OhGong. Apparently he went onto the next floor as soon as he passed his test, so he didn\u2019t get a chance to participate in the Tournament.\u2018He\u2019s the kind of guy who would have never missed a tournament like that.\u2019Anyway, YuWon was one of the people who showed interest in the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test. It was a test that, even far in the future, no one had ever managed to pass.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame the Heavenly Demon died early on.\u201d\u201cIf he was still alive, we\u2019d be able to at least figure out something.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s already a goner. Missing him will do nothing for us.\u201dThe Heavenly Demon lost his life early on in the fight against the Outer Gods. And since \u300cChronos\u2019s Clock Movement\u300d was made after the Heavenly Demon\u2019s death, they were unable to ask him anything.So in the end, nothing was known about the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.\u2018I guess there\u2019s no choice but to face it head on.\u2019YuWon knew nothing. Not what the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test was, not why, compared to all the other tests, this one was particularly more difficult. And\u2026\u201cSo, what\u2019s with the Heavenly Demonic Cult? Does anyone know anything?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s definitely something.\u201d\u201cSo we just don\u2019t know what that something is.\u201d\u201cWhatever it is, it won\u2019t be anything ordinary. Because out of everyone here, not a single one of us has ever passed the Demonic Cult\u2019s test.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it a gamble? What if it\u2019s a dud?\u201d\u201cThe Tower never betrays one\u2019s efforts and hard work. We can\u2019t be certain what the result might be, but there\u2019s no way it\u2019ll be a dud.\u201dYuWon\u2019s first order of agenda was to find out what it was that the Cult was hiding. There was only a very slim chance, but he couldn\u2019t risk it actually being a dud.AdvertisementsBut\u2026[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d wiggles.]It seemed that it wasn\u2019t a dud.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dThe unknown egg wiggled inside his inventory. And seeing the Egg awaken after so long made him think back to when he had just passed the 1st Floor\u2019s test\u2026Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: 53A month ago\u2026The world of the 2nd Floor wasn\u2019t all that nice of a place to live. The weather was hot and humid. It lacked food. And you never knew when monsters might attack the village.Because of that, civilization had barely advanced, and every lodging was cramped and moldy.\u201cOne point.\u201dThe only silver lining was the low prices.YuWon was used to filthy environments from experiencing war for such a long time, so he paid and entered the inn without hesitation.Flop\u2014Creak\u2014As soon as he laid down on the bed, he could feel the bed frame creak. However, YuWon wasn\u2019t concerned with stuff like that. His head right now was so full of thoughts, it felt like it was about to explode.\u2018The Egg.\u2019The nameless egg that was slumbering inside his inventory. YuWon had originally thought that it was a pathetic reward for having cleared the long Tutorial while breaking every single record.There were only two types of eggs that YuWon knew. The first were eggs that mythical or magical beasts hatched from. The second were edible eggs for consumption.Though he had assumed that this egg probably fell in the first category, it was clearly different.The incubation rate was stuck at 0%.YuWon had even been contemplating boiling it and eating it for nutrition if he couldn\u2019t find a use for it.\u2018Is it actually an Outer God\u2019s egg?\u2019He knew that it was no ordinary egg. That\u2019s why he came up with a few hypotheses.One of them was that it might be an egg of some great Dragon or Demon, the ruling races of the Tower. But after confirming the pattern of an Outer God on it, as well as watching it eat the entirety of Orochi\u2019s corpse, YuWon was certain.Inside this egg was a \u2018God\u2019 that existed from outside of the Tower.YuWon put his hand inside his inventory and pulled out the Egg, which had grown multiple times in size compared to when he had first obtained it.\u201cHey.\u201d[\u2026]The system was silent, and the Egg did not respond.This was the first time he had attempted to talk to it. He couldn\u2019t figure out if either it had heard him and was ignoring him or if it was still in slumber.\u201cAre you sleeping?\u201dHe tried talking to it a few more times, but there was still no response. YuWon gave up on talking to it and put the Egg back into the inventory.Aftering giving up on calling it out, he ended up thinking back to the Egg\u2019s form that had feasted on Orochi\u2019s corpse. A large, black something. The dozens of eyes and sharp teeth within it\u2026\u2018There\u2019s no way it\u2019s a monster that actually looks like that.\u2019YuWon had fought against quite a few Outer Gods.Their appearances varied greatly. Some looked like animals while others looked human. One of them was so large you couldn\u2019t properly perceive it\u2019s form, and it possessed multiple tentacles.However, guys like him weren\u2019t the truly terrifying ones. Most of the scariest ones actually looked fairly normal. There was a simple reason for this. It was because they didn\u2019t have a predetermined form. They acted like a mirror for their opponents\u2019 emotions like fear. And by using those emotions, they revealed themselves.Unknown and incomprehensible beings. Even YuWon, who had been fighting against them for so long, didn\u2019t know everything about the Outer Gods.\u2018If those guys were with me, I could at least talk it out with them.\u2019YuWon laid his head down on his bed.Son OhGong, Hercules, Odin, Chronos, Asura\u2026YuWon thought back to the many comrades that fought together with him in the war.Returning to the past from the destroyed Tower was a decision they\u2019d made together, and the path he was on right now was the product of their discussion and research.However, at this point in time, not a single person knew about the existence of Outer Gods. And of course, none of them would remember YuWon.\u201cDo I keep this alive or not?\u201d[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d shakes its head.]YuWon furrowed his brow.He put his hand back inside his inventory.\u201cYou bitch\u2026\u201dUntil just a moment ago, it wasn\u2019t responding, but as soon as he started contemplating killing it or not, it answered.That meant that it had heard YuWon and ignored him.YuWon shook his head from the sudden outburst of annoyance. He wanted to stir-fry or boil it and eat it, but he couldn\u2019t just do that.The day was spent contemplating about the Egg.Nervous, the Egg trembled. It knew that YuWon could toss it into a flaming hot fire at any moment.After a whole day\u2026Shing\u2014YuWon drew his sword.[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d is in shock.]Was it due to the higher incubation rate? The Egg was communicating more of its feelings. It was only borrowing the system\u2019s messages, but it was clear that the Egg was alive and breathing.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dYuWon swung his sword down towards the Egg.\u201cIt\u2019s quite regretful.\u201dSlash\u2014![\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d screams.]A desperate message.YuWon\u2019s sword stopped right above the Egg.The Egg wasn\u2019t the only one that was nervous. YuWon, who didn\u2019t know anything about it, was in the same boat.After stopping the sword right over the Egg, YuWon took a second to look around.It was tranquil. Nothing had happened.\u201c\u2026 Hmm.\u201dClick\u2014Aftering putting the sword back in its scabbard, YuWon stared at it.Thinking back to what happened with Orochi\u2019s corpse, the Egg was clearly more than capable of exerting physical force. Yet, the thing didn\u2019t bite its owner when he tried to harm it.YuWon wasn\u2019t certain if it\u00a0didn\u2019t\u00a0or if it\u00a0couldn\u2019t, but this had demonstrated that it was likely not dangerous.\u201cWell\u2026 I guess I have no choice but to see what happens.\u201d* * *[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d twitches.][\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d feels cozy.]From within the inventory, the Egg had been sending a message every once in a while since entering the territory of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.The Egg had been silent since the 2nd Floor, yet here it was saying it was cozy.YuWon took it out of his inventory. Seeing as how the incubation rate was still the same, it hadn\u2019t grown at all in the past month.\u201cYou like this?\u201d[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d responds.]\u201cYou need to tell me what your response is.\u201d[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d nods its head.]\u201cSo you do like this, huh.\u201dIt hadn\u2019t changed at all even after some time had passed, staying asleep most of the time.YuWon guessed that in order to increase the incubation rate, he\u2019d need some sort of power related to Outer Gods, like with \u300aYamata no Orochi.\u300b[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d falls asleep.]The thing that had been sleeping for an entire month fell back asleep after saying just a few words. YuWon wasn\u2019t sure why it had suddenly woken back up, but he guessed that it had something to do with the Cult.\u201cThe Outer Gods and the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2026\u201dFor there to be some sort of connection between the two\u2026 YuWon couldn\u2019t be certain yet, but he had a feeling that this test wasn\u2019t going to be easy.\u201cI hope I didn\u2019t enter a tiger\u2019s den.\u201dThat was something he\u2019d have to figure out first-hand from now on.A guest had arrived at the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Within a day, the news broke out within the entire Cult.\u201cWhat interesting news.\u201dSomeone who desired to take the Cult\u2019s test.The Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test wasn\u2019t just infamous within the Cult, but it was like a ghost story within the Martial Realm.The Cult was located in a place where you had to specifically seek it out, and even among the people who sought them out, many ended up leaving empty-handed.That was why players no longer challenged the Cult\u2019s test. It was an unspoken rule of sorts. Attempting the test would be a waste of your time at best, and at worst, you might even lose your life.\u201cA challenger, huh\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the first one since Cheon JaRyong.\u201d\u201cHow many years has it been?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s been about 30 years.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been 34 years.\u201dThe four leaders that made up the Heavenly Demonic Cult had gathered together.The Sword Lord, the Dao* Lord, the Spear Lord, and the Fist Lord.*TL/N: In Murim/Wuxia, swords and daos are commonly differentiated. A sword is a double-bladed weapon, while a dao is a single-bladed weapon.Each of them had reached the top of the Heavenly Demonic Cult within their respective fields, and they were the central figures that managed the cult.The Cult Council was a meeting held between the Four Lords where they discussed matters regarding the Cult. Normally, they\u2019d simply be talking about trading with the outside as well as small- and large-scale problems within Mt. Heaven, but today, a different matter was the central subject.There was a new challenger attempting the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test for the first time in decades.\u201cCheon JaRyong has been loyal to the Cult since long ago, so that wasn\u2019t a surprise. But who is this new fellow?\u201d\u201cApparently his name is Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cKim YuWon?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard of him? How can you know so little about how the world is going? I get that you\u2019ve taken root inside Mt. Heaven, but I\u2019ve constantly reminded you that you can\u2019t ignore what\u2019s going on in the Tower\u2026\u201d\u201cStop the useless nagging. Just tell me who he is,\u201d said the Sword Lord, the oldest among the Four Lords.The Dao Lord, the one who was \u2018uselessly nagging,\u2019 cleared his throat before continuing, \u201cSo the thing is\u2026\u201dHis explanation of YuWon wasn\u2019t all that long. To begin with, there wasn\u2019t much known other than that he was a rookie that climbed up while rewriting the rankings of each floor.\u201cA new record\u2026 So his goal isn\u2019t all that different from the previous challengers.\u201d\u201cIf there is one thing that\u2019s different, it would be his skills. They say that he managed to clear up to the twentieth trial of the 1st Floor\u2019s test\u2026\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t be certain until we see him for ourselves. Rumors are easy things to get blown out of proportion.\u201d\u201cThat might be the case with rumors, but the records inscribed into the Tower do not lie. Don\u2019t be such a pessimist.\u201dThe Four Lords extensively debated regarding YuWon, and in the end, they came to a single conclusion.\u201cLet\u2019s just call him over and see for ourselves.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Hmm. You have a fair point. We could talk here all day, but that\u2019ll be nothing compared to meeting him in person.\u201dThe Spear Lord nodded his head. He raised his hands, and the countless martial artists that were kneeling within the hall raised their heads, responding to his call.\u201cYes, sir!\u201dThump, thump\u2014!The stomping of hundreds of martial artists rang throughout the hall. And at the same time, a large door opened up, and a single person walked inside.The person\u2019s footsteps were light with not even a hint of nervousness.It was hard to believe someone could be so composed in front of hundreds of martial artists and the Four Great Lords of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.This kind of brazenness was rare to see from anyone that wasn\u2019t a Ranker, the ruling class of the Tower, or a ruling race, such as Dragons, Giants, or Demons.\u201cOho\u2026\u201d\u201cHe seems to have quite the guts.\u201dThe Sword Lord and the Dao Lord nodded their heads, seeing the sword that was fastened around the man\u2019s waist.The sword and the dao. As the two Lords wielded weapons of similar nature, they found him more favorable than the other two Lords did because he was a man that carried a weapon similar to them.YuWon looked at the Four Lords as he walked down the hall.The four each wore a different colored dragon robe. It was as if there were four emperors. However, among them, the one known as the God of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, the Heavenly Demon, was not present.\u2018So the Heavenly Demon didn\u2019t come.\u2019They were the next best thing.YuWon looked at the four martial gods that symbolized the Heavenly Demonic Cult.Sword, Dao, Spear, and Fist.They were beings that had reached the pinnacle of their art within the Demonic Cult. And they were also the people that ruled over the Cult in the place of the reclusive Heavenly Demon.\u201cSo it is you, the one that passed the first test of our leader.\u201d\u201cIndeed. He truly is different.\u201d\u201cStill, I wonder if he\u2019ll be able to pass all the tests\u2026\u201d\u201cI have quite the expectations. It seems it wasn\u2019t just an exaggerated rumor.\u201dThe Four Lords whispered amongst themselves while looking at YuWon.They each had different personalities and ideals, but on this matter, they were on the same page. There was no more need to think or debate.They exchanged looks and nodded their heads.\u201cThen, the second test shall\u2026\u201d\u201cPlease wait for me!\u201dOne of the martial artists in the hall, a man who donned a black martial arts uniform, stepped out.\u201cVice-captain of the Black Tempest.\u201d\u201cI apologize for interrupting, but I have a request for the Lords.\u201dThe vice-captain of the Black Tempest Squad, Cheon JaRyong. The man who was the last player to take the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test 30 years ago looked at YuWon.\u201cMay I please test this man first?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: 54Cheon JaRyong\u2019s request brought the hall to a dead silence.This was because the people who had to answer his request would not speak.Waiting for an answer from the Four Lords, JaRyong remained kneeling on one knee, bowing his head.\u201c\u2018Test,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dThe first one to speak after the long silence was the Sword Lord. He looked over at the other three.\u201cLet\u2019s make a decision through our usual means.\u201d\u201cRaise your right hand for a yea, your left hand for a nay.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine with me.\u201d\u201cWe shall go with the majority vote.\u201dWithout any hesitation, the Four Lords simultaneously made a decision.The Sword Lord did not raise his hand. The Dao Lord raised his left hand, while the Spear and Fist Lords raised their right hands.\u201cOne abstention. One nay. Two yeas.\u201dThe decision was quickly made.\u201cYou may do as you wish, Cheon JaRyong.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dJaRyong put his palm and fist together, bowing with a kung fu salute to thank the Four Lords.Subsequently, the martial artists in the hall took a few steps back, forming a large circle. YuWon and JaRyong ended up in the center of the circle.\u201cThis isn\u2019t an official part of the Cult\u2019s test, is it?\u201dAfter taking a second to assess the situation, YuWon looked over at the Sword Lord, the head of the Four Lords.This was an unprepared stage. There wasn\u2019t even a notification from the system. In addition, as JaRyong, a player from a higher floor, displayed hostility against YuWon, the penalty lingered in the air. That meant the Tower had not recognized this \u2018stage\u2019 as a test.\u201cThat\u2019s right. There cannot be a test without a reward. Now let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d the Sword Lord spoke. After thinking for a brief moment, he continued, \u201cAmong the Cult\u2019s elixirs, we shall reward you with the Crimson Blood Medicine Ball. How does that sound?\u201dThe \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball.\u300d A medicine ball that was red like blood, it was one of the better elixirs that the Heavenly Demonic Cult possessed.Though it was not as great as the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d that could be won from the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, it was still a more valuable elixir than the \u300cLesser Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u300d Among the elixirs one could obtain in the Martial Realm, it was a pretty decent one.YuWon smiled faintly. While looking at the Sword Lord, he quickly glanced over at JaRyong, who was openly displaying hostility towards him.\u201cThat will suffice.\u201d[The stage has been acknowledged as a test.][Cheon JaRyong\u2019s restriction has been reduced.][Cheon JaRyong\u2019s penalty has been reduced.][Defeat Cheon JaRyong and receive his acknowledgement.]Vzzzt\u2014The penalty surrounding JaRyong was now lighter. It was as good as having no penalty.\u2018So he\u2019s probably around the 30th Floor in strength.\u2019To defeat a player of this caliber in an unplanned test, this was fairly high in difficulty.\u2018So how hard is the actual test?\u2019YuWon had heard over and over that the Cult\u2019s test was difficult, but this was the first time he would experience it in person.JaRyong had his black sword ready, aiming it at YuWon.\u201cDid you say your name is Kim YuWon?\u201d asked JaRyong.YuWon nodded his head as he answered, \u201cWhat about it?\u201d\u201cI heard you passed the first test. That means that the Heavenly Demon has acknowledged you.\u201dIt seemed that the news that YuWon passed the first test had already spread throughout the Demonic Cult. Though that should have been pretty obvious to YuWon. This many martial artists and the Four Lords wouldn\u2019t have gathered over someone who wanted to take the test with no qualifications whatsoever.YuWon guessed that this gathering was ordered by the Heavenly Demon.\u201cI don\u2019t know what made the Heavenly Demon acknowledge you and give you a pass, but I\u2014\u201d\u201cSo you weren\u2019t acknowledged,\u201d YuWon cut him off. He was going on too long, but he didn\u2019t care to listen to him any further. \u201cUnlike me.\u201dAs the last player to attempt the Cult\u2019s test, JaRyong was quite proud of that fact, despite still not having accepted being failed without even getting to properly take the test.Kkk\u2014JaRyong ground his teeth. YuWon had hit the nail on the head with his words, and sometimes the truth hurt the most.Unable to hold back his anger, JaRyong charged in.Slash\u2014!JaRyong\u2019s black martial uniform fluttered as he swung his sword.His movements were quick, but despite the sudden attack, YuWon leisurely turned his body to dodge JaRyong\u2019s sword.\u201cThat\u2019s right! I wasn\u2019t acknowledged by the Heavenly Demon! I, who had sworn eternal loyalty to the Heavenly Demonic Cult!\u201dWhoosh\u2014His sword was fast and had weight behind it. On the edge of his blade, there was a type of mana called \u2018ki\u2019 in the martial Martial Realm, which increased the deadliness of his attacks.\u201cI dedicated my life to passing this test! From when I was young, I waited to become a player, strengthening my body, practicing martial arts! And when I made it back to the Martial Realm, I challenged the test! So why?!\u201dCrackle\u2014JaRyong must have exerted his power to the limit, causing the penalty to start sparking.Instead of striking back, YuWon just dodged his sword.\u201cHow did an outsider like you get acknowledged?! Why?! Why couldn\u2019t I be\u2014!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re like a kid.\u201dTak\u2014Slide\u2014YuWon\u2019s scabbard blocked JaRyong\u2019s blade. Then JaRyong\u2019s sword that had seemed like it was going to slice YuWon in half slipped sideways after losing balance.\u201cYou wanna know why?\u201dBurst\u2014YuWon\u2019s arm became reinforced with the power of a Giant.[Your arm has been imbued with the power of a Giant.][Partial Gigantification will occur.]Wham\u2014!YuWon punched JaRyong in the back, knocking him down.\u201cKugh!\u201dSlam\u2014!After hitting the ground, JaRyong\u2019s body recoiled, twitching. After a bit, he tried to get back up, but his eyes were already halfway rolled back.Ssk\u2014Flop\u2014JaRyong fell to the ground, his body going limp.YuWon said, \u201cThere\u2019s no special reason. It\u2019s because you were weak,\u201d as he looked down at the man passed out on the floor.* * *JaRyong had already lost consciousness. And even though he wasn\u2019t lucid to hear it himself, with how many people in the hall heard YuWon\u2019s words, he was bound to hear about it soon enough.YuWon turned his head and looked over at the Four Lords, asking them, \u201cIsn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cHah!\u201d\u201cHahahah!\u201d\u201cAhaha!\u201dThe Lords broke out in laughter. The Sword Lord, who had a silent and serious personality, only smiled, but the other three were having a ball.\u201cThat is indeed true.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I was so entertained.\u201d\u201cEven though a stage was created, if JaRyong wasn\u2019t penalized\u2026\u201d\u201cThat hypothetical is meaningless. He didn\u2019t even draw his sword.\u201d\u201cYou have a point.\u201dThe Lords started chattering amongst themselves.YuWon patiently let them go on. He guessed that since it had been a while since someone from outside had taken their test, he should let them enjoy it as much as possible.The Lords finished chatting after about five minutes. The first one to come to his senses was the Sword Lord.\u201cI apologize for making you wait. Getting chatty naturally comes with old age.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay, sir.\u201d\u201cWhere did you learn martial arts? I don\u2019t know what school that move was from, but the way you deflected JaRyong\u2019s sword was quite impressive.\u201d\u201cI was simply imitating it.\u201d\u201cYou were imitating it? \u2018Imitating,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dA large smile grew on the Sword Lord\u2019s face. He looked like he was about to burst out into laughter.\u201cYou there! Bring out a Crimson Blood Medicine Ball!\u201dFollowing the Sword Lord\u2019s order, a female servant that was on standby brought out a box containing the \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball.\u300dThe box was delivered to YuWon, and as soon as he took the box, he got a message.[You have passed the test.][You have obtained a \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball.\u300d]YuWon opened up the box. Inside the box, there was a bright red ball the size of a thumbnail. The \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball\u300d was now in YuWon\u2019s possession.\u201cThough it isn\u2019t that great of an item, think of it as a present for entertaining these old men.\u201d\u201cSince I didn\u2019t really do much, I am more than satisfied with this gift.\u201d\u201cWhat did you just say? Hahahah!\u201dThe Fist Lord, the one who had the loudest personality amongst them, broke out into laughter once again.There were two meanings behind YuWon\u2019s words. Firstly, that he wasn\u2019t one bit nervous about the test against Cheon JaRyong, the vice-captain of the Black Tempest Squad. To begin with, YuWon had found the test against JaRyong as easy as a challenge from a little child. Secondly, that he didn\u2019t consider the elixir \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball\u300d an all that amazing item.The \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball\u300d was an elixir that was definitely far from the caliber of the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u300d However, that didn\u2019t mean that the \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball\u300d was just some mediocre item. It was easily worth over 10,000 points. No player that had only just reached the 10th Floor should have even gotten to see such an expensive elixir. Even right now, in the Demonic Cult, there were countless players that wouldn\u2019t hesitate to jump in if the \u300cCrimson Blood Medicine Ball\u300d was put up as a reward.\u2018The reason why they put up the Crimson Blood Medicine Ball was because a reward of that level is required in order to decrease the restriction on JaRyong as much as possible. Despite that\u2026\u2019YuWon had taken down JaRyong far too easily. The fight had ended much sooner than they had expected. But that\u2019s also why the Four Lords found the fight that much more entertaining.\u201cI shall now tell you the contents of the second test,\u201d said the Sword Lord.\u201cThe second test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult will be with me, The Fist Lord, Pung BaekLim.\u201dThe Fist Lord. Among the Four Lords, he was the one with the most brazen personality.YuWon shifted his attention from the Sword Lord to the Fist Lord.Though there wasn\u2019t much information about the Heavenly Demon, there was plenty known about the Four Lords.\u2018The First Lord. One of the greatest masters of hand-to-hand combat. He\u2019s a player that became a Ranker by mastering martial arts.\u2019Every one of the Four Lords were Rankers. As some of the strongest people within the Heavenly Demonic Cult, they were currently the ones actually leading the Cult.\u201cOf course, we won\u2019t be having a normal duel. The objective is to endure three techniques against me, the Fist Lord.\u201dThree techniques. On first impression, it didn\u2019t seem like that hard a test. But the opponent was a Ranker. On top of that, it wasn\u2019t against a new greenhorn Ranker like Chryses, but one of the leaders of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2018The Fist Lord is the weakest among the Four Lords. However, the power behind each of his strikes rivals the Sword Lord, who has the highest ranking.\u2019That was the gist of the information known about the Fist Lord in the Martial Realm.\u2018And unlike with Chryses, this will be an official test.\u2019The penalty was a power that existed to prevent a player of a higher floor from indiscriminately using their power and destroying the ecosystem of the lower floors. However, in the case of a test recognized by the Tower, the domain of the penalty was diluted depending on the test.Therefore, depending on the penalty, the power that the Fist Lord could use would be unpredictable.\u2018But if it\u2019s only three attacks\u2026\u2019Seeing YuWon get lost in thought after hearing the contents of the test, the Fist Lord smirked.\u201cOf course, I also think that this is a nonsensical test.\u201dTo require a player that had only just reached the 10th Floor to withstand three techniques from a Ranker was merciless. Even if it was the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test, the difficulty made no sense.The Fist Lord raised three fingers.\u201cI\u2019ll give you three months.\u201dThree months wasn\u2019t a very long time, however, depending on how one used it, it also wasn\u2019t a short period of time.\u201cWith the exception of elixirs, we\u2019ll provide you with every resource within the Cult. The training facility, grain balls,* clothes, and a comfortable place to rest. Whatever you desire, we can\u2014\u201d*TL/N: A food made by mixing grains with elixirs. It\u2019s said to be able to hold back hunger, make your body into peak condition, and prevent you from losing too much weight during excessive training.\u201cNo. That won\u2019t be necessary.\u201d Having finished thinking, YuWon shook his head.The Fist Lord furrowed his brow, wondering what he meant.\u201cWhat do you mean, \u2018it won\u2019t be necessary\u2019?\u201dInstead of responding immediately, YuWon looked at his surroundings. Thanks to the fight against JaRyong, the martial artists of the Cult were already far away from him. It was already an ideal set up.\u201cLet\u2019s start right away.\u201dThe stage had already been prepared.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: 55The hall became turbulent.\u201cDid you hear that?\u201d\u201cI did. He wants to start right away.\u201d\u201cOkay, so I didn\u2019t hear that wrong. Does he have no fear?\u201d\u201cHe probably just doesn\u2019t know the Lords\u2019 true powers. He\u2019s an outsider who is unfamiliar with the cult, unlike the vice-captain.\u201d\u201cMaybe he misunderstood the rules.\u201d\u201cOr he\u2019s really that arrogant\u2026\u201dThe Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s martial artists present in the hall were angry, disapproving, and baffled. They were all thinking the same thing\u2014he must not know any better.\u201cKim YuWon.\u201dHaving heard the Spear Lord call his name, YuWon looked up at him.\u201cYou might not know this, but the Fist Lord is a Ranker. He\u2019s nothing like the passed-out vice-captain over there.\u201dHis voice sounded calm, but he appeared a bit angry.\u201cYou seem to be looking down on our cult too much just because you managed to take down a vice-captain.\u201dThis was the reason why the Spear Lord was angry. He thought that YuWon was looking down on the Heavenly Demonic Cult.As this was a natural misunderstanding, YuWon bowed and apologized.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if it sounded like that. However, I promise that I am not looking down on the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201cThen\u2014\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Spear Lord,\u201d the Fist Lord butted in between YuWon and the Spear Lord.The Fist Lord stood from his seat. When he stood up, he revealed that he was actually much taller and had a larger frame than it appeared while he was sitting down.\u201cHe says it\u2019s a misunderstanding. We should just do as he wants then.\u201dThough that was what he said, it was as clear as day that his pride had been hurt. The energy around him enveloped his body instead of spreading outward. It wrapped around him so sturdily, it was as if he was wearing steel armor.He looked as if he was about to dash towards YuWon at any moment and launch his fist.But right as the Fist Lord was about to take a step\u2026\u201cFist Lord,\u201d said the Sword Lord, \u201cStop.\u201d His words brought Pung BaekLim to a halt.\u201cDo you expect me to just let it slide after hearing that?\u201d the Fist Lord retorted.Though there was a difference in skill between the Four Lords, they were all in equal standing. There was no need for one to listen to another. However\u2026\u201cThis is a test bestowed by the Heavenly Demon. It is different from the test that just took place.\u201dThe Fist Lord\u2019s expression wavered ever so slightly.The Heavenly Demon. With the mention of his name, the Fist Lord had no choice but to back off. The Heavenly Demon\u2019s name carried absolute power within the Heavenly Demonic Cult.Additionally, the Sword Lord\u2019s words weren\u2019t just to stop the Fist Lord.\u201cThe only one who can change the Heavenly Demon\u2019s test is the Heavenly Demon himself. Three months time. Do not disregard that.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I was careless.\u201dThe Fist Lord sat back down. The prideful Fist Lord of all people. That\u2019s how great the authority of the Heavenly Demon was.But this did mean that YuWon wouldn\u2019t get what he wanted, no matter how much of a tantrum he threw.\u2018Three months, huh\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought.In the end, he was given three months\u2019 time. He didn\u2019t particularly like it, but this wasn\u2019t something to be disappointed by.YuWon looked down at the sword at his waist.\u2018It won\u2019t be too bad.\u2019Though he had taken a seat, the Fist Lord was still glaring at YuWon. He appeared to be holding himself back with everything he had.\u201cWell then, I shall see you in three months,\u201d said Pung BaekLim.* * *YuWon was treated as an important guest within the Cult for taking the Heavenly Demon\u2019s test. But another reason why he was treated well was because he had demonstrated that he wasn\u2019t a run-of-the-mill player like the ones that attempted the test long ago.One could tell that was the case just by the number of martial artists that had gathered in the hall. Rumors about YuWon had already spread throughout the Cult, which was why hundreds of martial artists had gathered to watch him.\u2018But still\u2026\u2019 thought YuWon.Tmp, tmp\u2014He looked at the old man walking in front of him.The Sword Lord, Shin MuGuek. He had personally taken on the task of guiding YuWon around. When the second-in-command of the Heavenly Demonic Cult took on a task as lowly as being a guide, his subordinates all opposed the idea.However, this was the Sword Lord. There was no one on Mt. Heaven who could bend his will except for the Heavenly Demon.\u201cWas this also an order from the Heavenly Demon?\u201dYuWon tried to suss out MuGuek\u2019s true intentions to see if the Sword Lord\u2019s interest in him was curiosity, good will, or hostility.Even though Rankers couldn\u2019t easily mess with an average player, MuGuek was someone to still be wary of.\u201cNo, it was not.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cThink of it as for my personal enjoyment. It has been a long time since I last met an outsider.\u201dDuring the entire future that YuWon lived through, MuGuek had remained inside the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Because he never left the 10th Floor, he was eventually forgotten by YuWon and the other Rankers.The most loyal subject of the Heavenly Demon, the man that never went outside the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s territory. That was everything YuWon knew about the Sword Lord.\u2018So it\u2019s just simple curiosity.\u2019If that was the case, he\u2019d be in the clear. YuWon hoped that MuGuek wouldn\u2019t become a variable in this test. But as long as it was just simple curiosity, YuWon thought it\u2019d be okay.But\u2026\u201cAnd I have high expectations.\u201d\u201cExpectations?\u201d\u201cHow could I not have high hopes after seeing you in person? I believe that if it\u2019s you, you might actually pass the Heavenly Demon\u2019s test.\u201dMuGuek spoke as if he wanted YuWon to pass the test, which was likely the case. It was actually the same for most martial schools. They wanted someone to learn their martial arts, pass their test, receive acknowledgment, and climb the Tower. They wanted great players to become Rankers and make a name for their martial school.However\u2026\u2018This feels a bit different.\u2019There was nothing concrete to back this feeling up, but YuWon felt an odd sense of desperation in MuGuek\u2019s words just now. It was a feeling that was different from simply wanting someone to climb the Tower and bring prosperity to the Cult.Tmp, tmp\u2014With MuGuek showing him the way, YuWon finally arrived at his destination after a long walk.Muguek turned around and finally asked the question that he\u2019d been curious about for a while. \u201cSo why this place? If you have something you need to prepare, wouldn\u2019t the weapons warehouse or even the martial arts library where we store our secret arts be more appropriate?\u201d\u201cI can skip the weapons warehouse. As for the martial arts library, I\u2019ll stop by there later.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that the medical house is even more important?YuWon started walking towards the medical house\u2019s door in response to his question.That\u2019s when MuGuek noticed that YuWon was smirking as he passed him.\u201cYou said that the Heavenly Demonic Cult will provide as much support as possible until the next test, right?\u201d\u201cThat is indeed correct.\u201dIf there were a myriad of challengers attempting the Cult\u2019s test, such conditions would have made no sense. However, YuWon was the first challenger in decades. Maybe because of that, the Heavenly Demon made such a proposition. With the exception of elixirs and the high-rank secret arts, they\u2019d spare no resources for him.As soon as YuWon had heard this proposition, he\u2019d immediately thought of one thing.\u201cThose words\u2026\u201dDrag\u2014As the medical house\u2019s door opened, the thick scent of medicinal herbs filled the air.\u201cYou\u2019re gonna regret them.\u201d* * *\u201cA-All of them?\u201dThe chief doctor of the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s medical house, Jin il-Hwan, was shocked by all the medicinal ingredients that YuWon gathered.It wasn\u2019t just him, though. It was the same for the other doctors that worked under him in the medical house. They had just spent half the day bringing out medicinal ingredients from their storage per YuWon\u2019s request.It was a pile that weighed hundreds of kilograms at least. Just by looking at the amount, this was roughly half of all the medical ingredients that the medical house possessed. And with the exceptions of medicine that counted as elixirs and the lowest-grade medicinal ingredients, one could say that all the medicine of the medical house was gathered here.\u201cYes. Thank you very much for all this.\u201dWithout even looking a little bit sorry, YuWon started putting all the ingredients into his inventory.Jin il-Hwan was absolutely baffled, but he couldn\u2019t say a thing because of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s orders.\u201cWith the exception of elixirs and the high-rank secret arts, spare no resources for him.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know why the Heavenly Demon had given such an order.The martial artists of the cult didn\u2019t think much of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s order. With the exception of elixirs and the secret arts, there wasn\u2019t much to provide him with. The weapons could just be loaned to him for a few months, and if you excluded the high-rank secret arts, there wasn\u2019t anything that wasn\u2019t already provided to their normal martial artists.The training facility, food, a few medical ingredients, and low-rank martial arts. They had thought that would be all they would need to support him, but\u2026\u201cWhy do you need this many medicinal ingredients?\u201dWith this many ingredients, the Demonic Cult could have even declared war against the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance. So for a single person to use all this, especially in only three months, it made no sense.Naturally, the chief doctor thought YuWon\u2019s request was absurd.\u201cI\u2019ll say this again, but any medicinal ingredients you have remaining after three months have to be returned. And if an ingredient that you didn\u2019t use gets damaged\u2026\u201d\u201cI have to reimburse it out of my own pocket. I\u2019ll make sure to remember it.\u201dIn the time they were talking, YuWon finished putting all the ingredients into his inventory.It was a fairly expansive inventory. Not only was it large, it also had a great ratio of weight reduction. Despite that, the inventory was almost crammed full.\u2018There was a shit-ton.\u2019After emptying out the medical house, YuWon was guided by a female servant.He thought he could hear the chief doctor\u2019s scream behind him, but YuWon decided to ignore it.\u2018In three months, he\u2019ll really be bawling his eyes out.\u2019YuWon thought maybe he should have at least left them with something, but then he shook his head.The belt around his waist, the \u300cHigh-Grade Inventory,\u300d had become heavy from all the items, yet YuWon was still uneasy.\u2018This might still not be enough.\u2019The place the servant guided him to was a cave halfway up Mt. Heaven.The entrance was only two meters tall, but inside, there was a large, empty space. It was a training chamber filled with grain balls.\u201cWe\u2019ve arrived.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cAlso, this\u2026\u201dThe servant handed YuWon a torch drenched in oil.YuWon lit the torch and walked inside the training chamber. As he lit the lights around the chamber, the dark interior brightened up.Fwoosh\u2014Flicker\u2014It was a long cave. As he went deeper inside, he found that the training chamber was hundreds of meters in diameter. On one side, there was a pile of grain balls.While he was taking the space in\u2026Rumble\u2014Draaag, thump\u2014\u2026 The entrance of the training chamber was sealed off.That entrance would likely not open for three months. The mechanism made it so it was only possible to close it from the outside and only be opened from the inside. So now, except for YuWon, no one could open that door.\u2018Without breaking it, that is.\u2019This was the perfect space to train without any interruptions.Also\u2026\u2018It\u2019s perfect for consuming this.\u2019YuWon put his hand inside his inventory. From Inside it, he managed to grab a hard gem-like thing.[Orochi\u2019s 7th Heart]\u15cc It is the 7th heart of Orochi, which was separated after being sealed by Susanoo.\u15cc It possesses a powerful poison.\u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart.\u300d An item he had received as a reward for clearing the 1st Floor\u2019s Colosseum, he had been unable to do anything with it yet. And there was a good reason for that.\u15cc It possesses a powerful poison.Due to the poison inside \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart,\u300d without some high-quality medicine, one couldn\u2019t even think about consuming it. That was how powerful the poison in the Heart was.\u2018I was wondering where I could obtain antidotes to consume this thing\u2026\u2019YuWon smiled while looking at his inventory full of medical ingredients.\u201cTo think I\u2019d end up hitting the motherlode here.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Chapter 56Crash\u2014!Rumble, rumble\u2014The peak of Mt. Heaven shook.JaRyong trembled, feeling the tremors. \u201cThe Fist Lord seems very angry,\u201d he said.\u201cI think he plans on completely crushing the challenger, disregarding the fact that the Heavenly Demon is favoring him.\u201dHaMuk, who was standing besides JaRyong, looked over at one of the peaks of Mt. Heaven.The Fist Lord was the most combative of the Four Lords. It was natural for him to warm up before a fight, but this time around, there were different feelings mixed in with his actions.\u201cEven though he\u2019s still a kid.\u201d\u201cAre you saying I got wrecked by a kid then?\u201d\u201cHahah!\u201dHaMuk burst out in laughter from JaRyong\u2019s question. He ended up remembering the duel between JaRyong and YuWon.\u201cYou\u2019re right. He\u2019s no ordinary kid.\u201d\u201cHow can someone that\u2019s only climbed up to the 10th Floor be so strong?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s probably fundamentally different from us. \u201d\u201cBut even if he\u2019s a Pure-Blood\u2026\u201dJaRyong and HaMuk were both players. Though they had now given up on climbing the Tower further, they were at one point also the center of attention for being Pure-Bloods from the Martial Realm.Though they couldn\u2019t be compared to Pure-Bloods from giant guilds like Olympus, the Heavenly Realm, or Asgard, they were quite proud of their origins.However\u2026\u201cIsn\u2019t this just too great of a difference?\u201dJaRyong thought back to his duel against YuWon. But, no, that wasn\u2019t a duel. That was a one-sided act of violence.Despite him having had most of the restrictions from the penalty removed due to the stage creation, JaRyong was taken down in an instant by YuWon.HaMuk also clearly remembered what happened back then. Though he wasn\u2019t taken by surprise as much as JaRyong, he was still pretty shocked.\u201cSo what do you think?\u2019Crash\u2014!Rumble\u2014The earth shook again.A single strike from the Fist Lord was capable of shaking the top of Mt. Heaven. And with every punch, the mana in the air grew denser, overflowing into the central area of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be able to withstand that?\u201dJaRyong could still feel the Fist Lord\u2019s strike throughout his entire body, even after the rumbling had subsided. Though he might have been the weakest among the Four Lords, a Ranker was still a Ranker.No matter how skilled one might have been, it would have been very difficult to withstand three techniques from the Fist Lord, who had been to the top of the Tower.\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201dJaRyong thought about it long and hard.YuWon and the Fist Lord.A reckless test where one had to withstand three techniques from a Ranker\u2026\u201cI think\u2026\u201d* * *Munch, munch\u2014YuWon chewed on the medicinal ingredients for a while. Various awful, bitter flavors enveloped his mouth. He thought maybe he should have brought some honey, but that would have only weakened the potency of the medicines.\u201cBlegh\u2014\u201dAlmost vomiting a couple of times, YuWon stopped eating the medicinal ingredients.Follow new_episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.\u201cIt\u2019s so gross\u2026\u201dHe thought maybe getting stabbed by swords while fighting would feel better. Never had YuWon imagined that there were so many different bitter flavors.

After eating them until his stomach was full, YuWon looked unsightly. His stomach now hurt from the effects of all the different medicinal ingredients.\u2018I think some of them got mixed into poison.\u2019Medicine was something that shouldn\u2019t have been consumed without the proper consultation from an apothecary. The reason for that was simple. When consumed incorrectly, medicines could become poisonous.Mixing various medicines together to create poison was something that the famed SaCheon Clan was well known for.\u2018It can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s not like I know what every medicine does.\u2019YuWon had asked the chief doctor about fatal combinations just in case. Thanks to that, YuWon was able to avoid consuming medicines that were potentially lethal together, but the chief doctor must not have taken into account the possibility of eating so many kinds all at once.Though it was only a little bit, one of the medicines he had consumed had a toxic reaction. Luckily, all it did was cause a bit of a stomach ache.\u2018But\u2026\u2019YuWon picked up the main course he had set aside for today.\u201cThis\u2019ll be over when they stop fighting against each other.\u201d[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d opens its mouth wide.]Sensing the egg inside his inventory move, YuWon frowned.It was happening again.\u201cThis one\u2019s off limits.\u201d[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d makes a curious face and\u2014]\u201cI said no.

The higher his poison resistance increased, the slower the poison spread throughout his body while also strengthening the medicines\u2019 effects.\u201cFuu\u2014\u201dYuWon, who had been flopped over and barely grabbing and eating the herbs, managed to turn his body over onto his back.His stomach still felt like it was engulfed in flames, but at least this was something.While chewing on a root he didn\u2019t know the name of, YuWon slowly opened his paralyzed eyes.[Your Arcane Power increased by 1.][Your Arcane Power increased by 1.]His stats increased along with his poison resistance, and Arcane Power was starting to increase at a rapid rate.\u2018It\u2019s going up faster than I expected.\u2019YuWon\u2019s current Arcane Power was 88. This was the result of increasing the completion rate of the [Heaven-Slaying Star,] leveling up, and climbing the Tower.Stats were something that were harder to increase the higher they were. Because of that, after a certain point, it became very difficult to increase one\u2019s stats except by leveling up.For this reason, rather than leveling up, YuWon had prioritized raising his stats through methods like consuming elixirs. And in that regard, \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart\u300d was one of the highest grade elixirs there were.But even taking that into account, his stats were increasing rapidly beyond his imagination.There was a single reason for this.\u2018I\u2019m barely losing any of the mana that the Heart possessed.\u2019Consuming an elixir was unlike eating normal food. Setting the poison neutralization side, it depended on the individual\u2019s mana control for how much of the elixir\u2019s mana they would be able to absorb.But even with great mana control, it should have been impossible for YuWon to absorb all the mana in Orochi\u2019s Heart with his current power level. Despite that, YuWon was able to absorb it with barely any loss.\u201cHow is this possible\u2026? Wait.\u201dYuWon remembered a skill he had forgotten. He quickly checked the skill.[Master of Mana]\u15cc Rank : S+Follow new_episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.\u15cc Proficiency : 3.05%[Master of Mana] was a skill that increased the recovery rate, resistance, and sensitivity to mana.

He shoved it in his mouth and started neutralizing the poison that had begun spreading inside his body again.This had now been going on for a few days. In order to neutralize all the poison and absorb all the mana inside \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart,\u300d YuWon would need more than just a few days.Even though blood dripped from his mouth because of the internal injuries caused by the poison, YuWon was still smiling.\u201cThis\u2026 is going to take quite a bit.\u201d* * *The Heavenly Demonic Cult had been frozen like the winter of the northern sea.It was an organization that had been in seclusion for a long time, located on the outskirts of the Martial Realm on the 10th Floor of the grand Tower. Within that Cult, a small wind had started blowing.\u201cIt\u2019s been a month now.\u201d\u201cHe might be planning on staying inside for the full three months.\u201d\u201cYou might be right. I thought he would have at least come out in the middle to obtain a secret art or something.\u201dHaMuk looked at the entrance of the training chamber YuWon had entered.A month had already passed by, and the only thing YuWon had taken with him were the medicinal ingredients he got from the medical house. He didn\u2019t take any secret arts or weapons of the Heavenly Demonic Cult with him.HaMuk thought, \u2018There\u2019s no way a player that only just arrived on the 10th Floor would pass on the opportunity to learn a secret art of the Martial Realm. He should at least know that, but\u2026\u2019They had naturally assumed that YuWon would come out sometime in the middle, but, as if he didn\u2019t need a break or any other preparations, YuWon hadn\u2019t emerged.\u201cAnd I\u2019m not sensing any special traces of ki.\u201dThe Fist Lord\u2019s training was loud enough to shake the mountaintop. Meanwhile, YuWon hadn\u2019t let out a sound nor any trace that he was even alive. There was a stark contrast between the two.\u2018The Fist Lord entered seclusion training for three months. His goal is probably to resume training, which he hadn\u2019t been making much progress in,\u2019 thought HaMuk.People thought that he was going overboard while trying to face a player from just the 10th Floor. But HaMuk thought maybe it was natural for the Fist Lord to act this way after seeing YuWon\u2019s duel against JaRyong and taking YuWon\u2019s words as provocation.And so, YuWon should have displayed an appropriate response, but to his dismay, YuWon was silent as the dead inside his training chamber.\u201cWhat training do you think he\u2019s doing? He\u2019s beyond quiet.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m wondering that too.

    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Chapter 57YuWon, who had exited the training chamber after almost a month, looked skinnier. His face was thinner, and his skin was a pale white from not having seen the sun in such a long time.\u2018What the\u2026?\u2019\u2018Has he been sick and not training?\u2019\u2018Is it because of the medicinal ingredients?\u2019\u2018By the looks of it, he won\u2019t even last a single technique, let alone three\u2026\u2019HaMuk and JaRyong\u2019s heads were filled with all different thoughts on YuWon. Though you weren\u2019t supposed to judge a player by their outward appearance, that was how bad YuWon was looking.\u201cAre you guys here to welcome me?\u201d YuWon asked HaMuk and JaRyong who had been waiting at the entrance of the training chamber.Despite his sickly appearance, YuWon was walking just fine. In fact, his gait looked even more stable than before.HaMuk didn\u2019t fail to notice this detail.\u2018Did he learn a stepping technique while he was inside?\u2019YuWon had gotten pretty close to him, and HaMuk responded while trying to hide what he had just thought.\u201cWe just stopped by in passing. So, did you manage to make any progress while you were inside the\u2026?\u201d HaMuk suddenly shut his mouth mid-sentence.YuWon put on a new pair of clothes from the female servant that was waiting for him nearby.There was a thick smell of medicinal herbs surrounding YuWon, which was the reason why HaMuk stopped talking.\u201cI heard that he grabbed all sorts of medicinal ingredients from the medical house\u2026\u201dThat was something that HaMuk had heard plenty of times. He had heard the rumors that because the challenger took a huge amount of medicinal ingredients and antidotes, the medical house was short on supplies.HaMuk had wondered what he\u2019d needed so many medicinal ingredients for. Getting injured during martial arts training wasn\u2019t uncommon, but there was no way he would need so much medicine.\u201cDid you actually consume all of that?\u201d HaMuk asked.JaRyong also picked up on the thick scent of medicinal herbs from YuWon and ran inside the training chamber. He wanted to check if the inside of the training chamber also stank of herbs.\u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d YuWon said while rubbing his stomach that had only seen bitter medicinal ingredients and antidotes for a month. \u201cLet\u2019s first grab some food.\u201d* * *Clatter, clatter\u2014Rip, chomp\u2014YuWon ate up his food like a savage. After tearing apart a chicken leg and shoving it in his mouth, he pointed at the vegetable stir-fry with his chopsticks before he was even done chewing. And at the same time, he looked around at the other foods on the table.HaMuk, who was dining on the opposite side of the table, stopped his hand and asked, \u201cDid you starve yourself for a month or something?\u201dThere were grain balls inside the training chamber. Though they weren\u2019t delicious, one could satiate their hunger and get the necessary nutrition by eating them.There could have been some mistake and the training chamber might have had no grain balls, but if that was the case, he would have left the training chamber much sooner.\u201cI had planned on coming outside at least once so I wouldn\u2019t have any reason to eat those nasty things.\u201d\u201c\u2026 So you did starve?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dVisit lightnovelworld.com for a better_user experienceAfter answering, YuWon continued to feast.To have actually starved himself for a month\u2026 HaMuk couldn\u2019t believe it. He then thought how technically YuWon hadn\u2019t been starving since his stomach was full of something, just not food.\u2018I can\u2019t believe he actually ate all those medicines,\u2019 HaMuk thought.The scent of various medicinal ingredients still hadn\u2019t dissipated.\u2018Where did he use all those ingredients? He doesn\u2019t look injured. Was he poisoned or\u2026?\u2019HaMuk\u2019s train of thought came to a halt and his eyes widened. Poisoning. That would explain all this.Among elixirs, there were a few that were hard to consume due to their strong poison. In those cases, the poison was often more powerful than its effect as an elixir, so it was more common to simply use them as poisons instead.But (not-so) hypothetically speaking, what if someone could get an infinite amount of antidotes provided to them, regardless of how many points they were worth\u2026\u2018That adds up. A poisonous elixir\u2026\u2019But there was still a lingering question in his mind.\u2018How poisonous was the elixir?\u2019HaMuk had stopped caring about the meal. He was busy staring at YuWon, who had cleared almost all the food on the table, including his own.Then, as soon as the meal was over\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll be on my way then.\u201dWith his stomach now full, YuWon got up without any hesitation.After just a single hearty meal, YuWon\u2019s pale and sickly appearance was nowhere to be seen.\u201cWhere are you headed?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m headed to the martial arts library.\u201d\u201cTo the library?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNow that YuWon had finished his first order of business, it was time to prepare for his next course of action.\u2018Figures. As a player, training martial arts for two months is bound to be better than leveling up a couple of times\u2026\u2019 thought HaMuk.For the first time since YuWon had made it to the Heavenly Demonic Cult, his actions seemed reasonable.HaMuk nodded his head as he spoke, \u201cJust remember that there are restrictions to the books you can check out.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind. Well then\u2026\u201d YuWon gave a short goodbye to HaMuk before leaving.After asking the servant assigned to him, he was guided to a large building with dozens of martial artists on guard.While following the servant, YuWon closely observed the martial artists.\u2018They all seem like players.\u2019He couldn\u2019t tell if they were Pure-Bloods like HaMuk or JaRyong, but they were all players that had climbed somewhat high up the Tower.Among them, there was even a player that appeared much more skilled than HaMuk. YuWon guessed that he might have even been pretty close to being a Ranker.Read at wuxiaworld.eu \u2018No, there might even be a real Ranker amongst them.\u2019YuWon looked over at the man that was standing guard right in front of the library. He had the most normal-looking face, and he was wearing a plain outfit, but YuWon was sure that he was the one in charge here.\u2018The security is tight.\u2019They had placed one of the few Rankers of the Heavenly Demonic Cult here.\u2018I guess that\u2019s only natural.\u2019The martial arts library was the most important place of every martial school since the records saved inside were basically the roots and foundations of their schools. It was essentially everything for a school.So of course it would be even more sacred for the Heavenly Demonic Cult, considered the strongest martial school, as well as the origin of the Heavenly Demon, the strongest martial artist.\u2018This means that it\u2019ll be impossible for me to view any information beyond what I\u2019m permitted.\u2019This wasn\u2019t just a test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. The martial schools of the Martial Realm\u2019s tests were recognized by the Tower\u2019s system, and the Cult was no different. This was the Tower\u2019s test. And the Tower\u2019s test wasn\u2019t so flimsy as to easily let someone view information beyond what they were permitted.\u201cIs this really necessary? Even without a guard, I wouldn\u2019t be able to see it anyway,\u201d YuWon asked, annoyed by the watch of the guards following him.The martial artist who YuWon thought was a Ranker answered, \u201cIt\u2019s a standard procedure. Please follow it.\u201dHe was at least more respectful than HaMuk. YuWon had heard that most of the martial artists of the Cult were combative and lacked manners.After hearing his answer, YuWon stopped complaining. Since he was in the middle of taking the Cult\u2019s test, he knew that they wouldn\u2019t interfere or butt in with what he was doing\u2026\u2018As long as I stay within the lines that is.\u2019After complying with the simple procedures, YuWon was able to step foot inside the library.The building had a high ceiling, and there were bookshelves stacked all the way up to it.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dEven YuWon couldn\u2019t help but voice his amazement.How many books could there be in here? Hundreds of thousands? Maybe millions?It was simply one massive library.\u201cYou are not allowed to go into the area connected by that door. Please keep that in mind, but feel free to browse any books inside here.\u201dAfter telling him that, the head guard stepped to the side of the room so as to not get in his way.YuWon was surprised by the fact that there was a dust-covered steel door where the head guard had pointed to. He was amazed that there were even more books.\u2018Does that mean that these are all just the low-rank martial arts?\u2019The Heavenly Demonic Cult had a history of thousands of years. They existed even before entering the world of the Tower, and they endlessly worked to create, invent, and advance martial arts. And this martial arts library was the essence of that very cult.\u2018It\u2019s even more impressive than I had imagined.\u2019YuWon had previously seen the martial arts library of various martial schools, like the NamGung Clan\u2019s. He had been invited by martial schools that had wanted to leave a good impression on him, as he had been a player that was soon to become a Ranker.\u2018It\u2019s got to be at least three\u2026 no, four times larger than that of the NamGung Clan\u2019s.\u2019YuWon grabbed the first book that was within his reach and checked it out.The letters of the martial realm were automatically translated by the system.The most up-to-date novels are published_here > lightnovelworld.com\u2018This must be a fist technique that\u2019s based on the Eight Extreme Fists. It\u2019s more complicated, which results in more destructive power, but at the cost of defense.\u2019Since he opened it, YuWon thought he might as well try it, mimicking the drawings in the book.As he had previously managed to pass the test on the 10th Floor, he already had some knowledge of martial arts.Mimicking the forms didn\u2019t last very long.Tak\u2014YuWon closed the book.\u2018I already knew this, but martial arts just don\u2019t suit me.\u2019In the Tower where the power of the system existed, martial arts was a slow and frustrating field of study. Unless one had real talent for martial arts, learning them to become stronger simply wasn\u2019t efficient.After putting the book back in its place, YuWon started looking around the massive library. There were an endless number of books. It made YuWon wonder how he would ever manage to read through all of them.Still, he didn\u2019t have a choice. Looking through a single library would beat searching through every nook and cranny of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2018There\u2019s no way three months was just given arbitrarily.\u2019The Tower did not test the impossible because an impossible test lost its meaning as a test. That was the unchanging law that YuWon remembered.But this test had a nearly impossible level of difficulty for a normal player.\u2018Not only do I have to withstand three techniques from a Ranker, it\u2019ll be the Fist Lord\u2019s, no less.\u2019This wasn\u2019t a test that should have been given to a player who had only just reached the 10th Floor.When the test was first explained to him, YuWon thought something was odd. Of course, he thought he was capable of passing the test, and he did try to challenge it right away, thinking that he could gain a bigger reward by completing it faster, but that didn\u2019t brush away the feeling of oddness.\u2018The key things for clearing this test are the three months of time and the resources provided to the player.\u2019And that\u2019s why YuWon came to the library to find it.\u2018There\u2019s two months left.\u2019Tmp\u2014YuWon started thoroughly searching the martial arts library.\u2018I need to find it within one month, max.\u2019Flip, flip\u2014YuWon opened up a book, flipped through the first chapter, and put it back. There was no need to read it thoroughly. It was a daunting task, to skim and sort through hundreds of thousands of books one by one.In reality, it was an impossible task to read all these books. One couldn\u2019t decide which of these countless books to learn by first reading through them all.There were plenty of ways to cut down time, such as checking the category of the book, inspecting the exterior and title, as well as skimming through the first chapter, because YuWon already had a hunch.\u2018This is a cultivation technique. This is a sword technique. This is\u2026 a meditation technique? There was something like this?\u2019What YuWon wanted wasn\u2019t something like a sword technique, a dao technique, or a stepping technique.\u2018It has to be here\u2026\u2019The Fist Lord was one of the leaders of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, not to mention a Ranker, as well as one of the strongest martial arts masters in the Martial Realm. There had to be a clue somewhere in here on how to go up against Pung BaekLim.Follow current_novel on lightnovelworld.com\u2018\u2026 The origins of the Heavenly Demon God.\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Chapter 58\u201cHalf a month?\u201d\u201cYes. Apparently, he\u2019s been browsing the martial arts library for that long.\u201dMuGuek put down his teacup after hearing the report from his subordinate.He had already heard that YuWon had exited the training chamber. He thought YuWon would just pick a few martial arts and go back into the training chamber, but for him to have holed up inside the library for half a month now\u2026\u201cWhat is he doing in there?\u201d\u201cWhen I checked in on him, he appeared as if he was planning on skimming through every single book.\u201d\u201cAll of them?\u201dMuGuek himself had been inside the martial arts library a few times. He\u2019d even looked through a few martial arts books as well.To skim through all those books would be impossible to do in three years, let alone three months.\u201cFirst he grabbed a mountain of medicinal ingredients from the medical house, and now this. He\u2019s just doing one weird thing after another.\u201d\u201cI personally don\u2019t think he\u2019s someone the Lords should be mindful of, sir.\u201dOf course the subordinate thought that. It was natural for players that reached the Martial Realm on the 10th Floor to learn and practice martial arts. Though it was a personal choice to really try and master it, YuWon\u2019s current actions seemed like a complete waste of time.\u201cDo you think his actions are weird?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cI think so as well.\u201dMuGuek looked at his reflection on the teacup.\u201cHis thoughts and actions are entirely unpredictable.\u201dHe had expected YuWon to train hard inside the training chamber for three months since there was really nothing else he could do. Yet YuWon\u2019s actions continued to defy his expectations.A faint smile appeared on MuGuek\u2019s face.\u201cThe more he breaks my expectations, the more my hopes for him grow.\u201dAfter seeing YuWon up close, MuGuek had gotten a weird weird feeling.The power that he sensed from YuWon wasn\u2019t all that remarkable. Of course, it was unbelievable for a player that had just arrived on the 10th Floor, but it was nothing compared to Rankers that stood at the top of the Tower.However\u2026\u2018I can see it in his eyes.\u2019MuGuek could tell that YuWon was sure to become a Ranker one day.The greater one\u2019s goals and aspirations, the further one\u2019s eyes were able to see. That\u2019s all that MuGuek thought it was when he first saw YuWon, but that was no longer it.\u201cLet\u2019s start right away.\u201dMuGuek got a different feeling from him, seeing him confidently ask for the test against the Fist Lord right away.\u2018It doesn\u2019t seem like he\u2019s aiming to become something great, he just already is\u2026\u2019 MuGuek thought.YuWon wasn\u2019t being prideful and overconfident. To him, this was only natural. Compared to the world that he was looking at, the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test was small and insignificant.This was simply a stop in his long journey, and YuWon was already looking far beyond this test.\u201cHe\u2019s looking at a place much higher than here,\u201d said MuGuek.* * *Try the lightnovelworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.Another month went by. A total of two out of the three promised months had now passed.YuWon had only managed to skim through half of the books in the martial arts library by now.Thump\u2014YuWon closed the book he was reading.The guards watching over YuWon expected him to put the book back in its place as he had been doing all this time. But this time, it was different.YuWon grabbed the book while mumbling to himself, \u201cI found it.\u201dIt had been a month since he\u2019d been holed up inside the martial arts library, only eating the grain balls and barely getting any sleep.YuWon finally exited the martial arts library.And then, another month passed by.* * *\u201cOne month inside the training chamber. One month inside the martial arts library. And then another month inside the training chamber\u2026\u201dAfter coming out of seclusion training, the Fist Lord was told the news after he spent a whole day resting.The Heavenly Demonic Cult was disconnected from the outside world. Nothing of note really ever happened inside the Cult, so the only interesting news was information regarding YuWon.\u201cMaybe I did all that for nothing.\u201dThere was nothing special about the actions that YuWon had demonstrated for the past three months. He consumed elixirs and medicinal herbs, then trained for a month after selecting a martial art from the library.A month. It was barely enough time to master a martial art, even with the power of the system. He would be like a fledgling that only just learned how to walk. Despite that, YuWon claimed he would block three of his techniques.\u201cMy seclusion training is going to go to waste.\u201dThe Fist Lord donned his martial arts uniform and left his residence.The stage was going to be the martial arts training ground for sword practice, and the martial artists of the Cult were already crowding around to watch.\u201cIs it starting soon?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a rare feast for the eyes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not everyday one gets to see the skills of the Fist Lord.\u201d\u201cI heard that that YuWon kid is pretty famous on the lower floors.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just the lower floors. I heard even the upper floors are in a riot with even the major guilds trying to get in contact with him.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure the major guilds already know he\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t he still just a newbie that just got to the 10th Floor?\u201d\u201cDid you forget what happened to the vice-captain of the Black Tempest Squad?\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201dThe reason why everyone was excited for this test wasn\u2019t just because there hadn\u2019t been a player to challenge the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test in a while. It was because of Kim YuWon, a player that smashed through each floor\u2019s test, dominated the rankings, and set achievements that even the highest Rankers of the Tower couldn\u2019t accomplish.Because YuWon was the challenger, people of the Cult had high hopes\u2014hopes that he would become the first player to clear the Cult\u2019s test.If YuWon could clear the Cult\u2019s test and climb the Tower, the revival of the Cult wouldn\u2019t just be a pipe dream.\u201cHeheheh\u2014\u201dAfter listening in on the crowd by increasing his hearing abilities, the Fist Lord let out a silent laugh.You can_find the rest of this_content on the lightnovelworld.com platform.The subordinate that followed behind him remained as quiet as possible, watching his step because the Fist Lord was emanating so much fighting spirit. The subordinate was afraid that if he got too close, the Fist Lord would crush his entire body with a single blow.\u201cEveryone\u2019s full of expectation,\u201d said the Fist Lord.It was true. Everyone was indeed betting their hopes on YuWon. Some were even literally betting their points on whether or not YuWon would pass the test.The Fist Lord found this all distasteful. No matter how great he may have been, how could a brat that just arrived on the 10th Floor be a match against him?Of course, this wasn\u2019t a real match. It was simply to see if he could block three techniques. But, actually, it wasn\u2019t quite that simple.\u201cWhy did the Heavenly Demon give such a test\u2026\u201dHe might have shone with potential, but YuWon was still just a player. And a player of a lower floor that had just arrived on the 10th Floor at that. Even though he possessed the skills to take down Cheon JaRyong in an instant, the Fist Lord thought that was far from enough to even block a single one of his techniques.\u201cIt\u2019s time, sir,\u201d the subordinate alerted the Fist Lord, who had been standing motionless for a while.This test was so important that it was rumored the Heavenly Demon himself would come to spectate it. So it was inexcusable for even the Fist Lord to be late to this occasion.\u201cAlright,\u201d the Fist Lord said as he started walking again, \u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s go.\u201dTmp, tmp\u2014The Fist Lord finally arrived at the training grounds.The grounds were completely silent, despite the fact that it was crowded full of people with no room to move.The thousand martial artists of the Heavenly Demonic Cult were all gathered here. They were all holding their breaths, waiting for the stage to be ready.\u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cThe Fist Lord\u2026\u201d\u201cWow. Damn. This is my first time watching him in action.\u201d\u201cGetting to watch a Ranker fight is like a once-in-a-lifetime chance.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen him fight once before. It was seriously unbelievable\u2026\u201dA bit of a clamor erupted at the appearance of the Fist Lord.The commotion made him furrow his brow. Their conversations were so flippant.But that was to be expected. Half the players here were from the outside. There were players like JaRyong and HaMuk that were born inside the Cult, but a large portion weren\u2019t. It was hard to expect loyalty to the Heavenly Demonic Cult or a sense of respect towards the Heavenly Demon from them. They were simply here to watch a good fight.The Fist Demon got on the stage.YuWon had yet to arrive.\u201cIs this all?\u201d the Fist Lord said.It was a rhetorical question. He had eyes. He could see that the thousand people here were everyone in the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201c\u2026 The Cult truly has become weaker.\u201dDue to the organization being cut off from the outside, the number of players that joined decreased, and naturally the amount of people leaving increased. If it weren\u2019t for the authority of the High-Ranker the Heavenly Demon, they wouldn\u2019t have even lasted this long.However, a single person wasn\u2019t enough.\u201cYou\u2019re here,\u201d said MuGuek, while approaching the Fist Lord. He had been waiting there for a while now.The Fist Lord took a look around the training grounds, looking at the Cultists that had gathered. He asked, \u201cDid we really have to make such a big deal out of this?\u201d\u201cThis test has not only caught the attention of the Martial Realm, but also various guilds in the Tower. It can\u2019t hurt to make it a big occasion.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re such a loyal dog.\u201dThe source of this_chapter; lightnovelworld.comAmong the Four Lords, MuGuek, the Sword Lord, was the most clever out of all of them.He had given permission for people to spectate the test through the martial artists of his Cult and even spread some rumors himself.Among the martial artists of the Cult, quite a few of them had a connection to outside martial schools. So the fact that YuWon was taking the Cult\u2019s test was a perfect signal to use to alert the revival of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cNow, the best thing that could happen here would be him actually blocking three of your techniques.\u201d\u201cSorry, but that won\u2019t happen.\u201d\u201cTrue. This is a test.\u201dThe Tower\u2019s system was not to be underestimated. If the Fist Lord purposely let YuWon pass, the test would be counted as invalid, and the test would be substituted with a different test of a similar difficulty. So going easy on YuWon here was pointless.\u201cNot just that, I don\u2019t intend on introducing him to the Heavenly Demon if he can\u2019t even pass the test with own strength.\u201d\u201cIs that really your only reason?\u201d asked MuGuek.The Fist Demon huffed in response, \u201cI\u2019ll at least try and not kill him.\u201dTmp, tmp\u2014The crowd split, and from within the crowd, a person walked into the training grounds.YuWon, who had just exited the training chamber, had arrived at the stage of the test.\u201cYou\u2019re late,\u201d said the Fist Lord.\u201cI thought I got here just in time? Also\u2026\u201dThe promised time was noon. The sun was currently right above their heads, so it was true that he\u2019d arrived just in time.\u201c\u2026 The main character is supposed to show up last.\u201dYuWon put the sword on his waist into his inventory and instead pulled out \u300cEdge of Nightfall.\u300d\u201cThat\u2019s a bizarre sword you have right there.\u201dAfter seeing that the stage was set, MuGuek stepped far away.The training ground was hundreds of meters wide. It was the perfect location for a fight.\u201cLet\u2019s see how much progress you\u2019ve made in three months.\u201dFwooo\u2014The Fist Lord started emanating fighting aura, and with that, a message popped up for YuWon, the participant of the test.[The test will now begin.][Please dodge or block three techniques from \u2018The Fist Lord Pung BaekLim.\u2019]The test had now started.Watching the Fist Lord get into position, YuWon raised his sword.

A spine-chilling, destructive fighting spirit.Flash\u2014!A bright light filled YuWon\u2019s eyes.[Heavenly Destructive Lightning]Everything where YuWon was standing was completely eradicated.Crash\u2014!The imaginary sound from earlier could actually be heard this time.YuWon looked at the spot where he had been standing just a second ago.With a flash of blue lightning and the force from the punch, an area dozens of meters wide had become a dug out pit.\u2018It would have been bad if I got caught up in that.\u2019A terrifyingly destructive technique. YuWon couldn\u2019t believe this was the first technique.\u201cSo you dodged it.\u201dVzzt, crackle\u2014Lightning mana was encircling the Fist Lord\u2019s fist. In the martial realm, they called it ki.\u201cGood judgment. If you\u2019d tried to block it instead of dodging it, you\u2019d have been dead meat,\u201d said the Fist Lord.YuWon believed him. In fact, YuWon would have been lucky if there was even a piece of his flesh left. Most players would have been burnt to ashes with no recognizable remains of them left over.\u2018To be able to display this much power on the 10th Floor, this is crazy,\u2019 thought YuWon.This might have been a test, but for the penalty to be decreased to this extent on the 10th Floor, YuWon couldn\u2019t help but think that the test\u2019s difficulty made no sense.\u2018Two left.\u2019YuWon had managed to survive five bouts against Chryses, a Ranker just like the Fist Lord. However, the penalty and the restriction of power was much stronger for Chryses, not to mention the fact that he was injured from his fight against Hephaestus.This situation was different. The Fist Lord was many times stronger in comparison to the worn-out Chryses. And thanks to this being a test, his penalty and restrictions were weaker.\u201cIf you can, I\u2019d like to see you try dodging it again,\u201d said the Fist Lord.Earlier, he had swung his left fist. This time he swung his right fist, but very slowly.The speed at which the Fist Lord was extending his arm was almost enough to make YuWon yawn. However\u2026\u2018It\u2019s accelerating,\u2019 YuWon noticed.The slow-moving fist almost seemed like a lie as it started moving so fast that one almost couldn\u2019t see it anymore.[Hundred-Step Lightning Fist]Rumble\u2014!The earth shook. The area that this second punch destroyed was even larger than his first. It was as if thunder and lightning rained down from the skies.Crumble\u2014After having used his second technique, BaekLim squinted his eyes.Once again, YuWon had moved ahead of time and escaped the range of his attack. This time it was much closer, but this was clearly something that wasn\u2019t possible just by being quick-footed.\u2018He moved before I even extended my fist,\u2019 the Fist Lord thought.It felt as if YuWon was anticipating his movements.That was when\u2026For more_novel, visit lightnovelworld.comFsss\u2014YuWon\u2019s eyes changed to red.And it was no normal shade of red. Seeing how they changed suddenly, the Fist Lord could tell that this wasn\u2019t a normal phenomenon.\u2018It must be because of a skill,\u2019 he thought.A skill that could read his attacks. He guessed that it must have been at least an A-rank skill because how else could he have avoided two of his punches?\u201cNo wonder he was so confident,\u201d the Fist Lord remarked.With such eyes and the ability to move that fast, it shouldn\u2019t be hard to dodge three attacks, no matter how destructive the attack might be. BaekLim finally understood why YuWon had wanted to start the test right away.He scoffed. \u201cHow absurd.\u201dRumble\u2014Above Mt. Heaven, dark stormy clouds started to form. The peak of Mt. Heaven was above the clouds, so this was no natural phenomenon.From Pung BaekLim\u2019s hand, blue lightning was gathering, and his surroundings were starting to spark.\u201cAt the top of this Tower is a world you have no clue about,\u201d BaekLim spoke.MuGuek, who was watching over the fight, clicked his tongue. He could tell that the aftershocks of the attack were going to go beyond the training grounds.\u201cI\u2019ll have to do something about that,\u201d MuGuek said.\u201cLet me,\u201d the Spear Lord said while getting up from his seat. He started preparing so BaekLim\u2019s attack wouldn\u2019t have an effect outside the arena.YuWon could also tell this third technique was going to be completely different than the previous ones.\u2018I won\u2019t be able to dodge this,\u2019 he thought.He guessed that the power of this attack would be less than the previous two because even BaekLim shouldn\u2019t be able to output enough power to completely annihilate this entire area. They might have been in the middle of a test, but as someone who wasn\u2019t even a High Ranker, the Fist Lord shouldn\u2019t have permission to use that much power.\u2018So in exchange for having a wider range, the attack should be that much weaker\u2026\u2019Stomp\u2014YuWon planted his two feet firmly into the ground.Spark, crackle\u2014The power of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d traveled from his hand into his sword.On top of that\u2026[Your arms have been imbued with the power of a Giant.][Partial Gigantification will occur.]Crack, crack\u2014Both his arms became strengthened by [Gigantification.]YuWon clenched his sword with both hands.

BaekLim thought that it would have been the right decision\u2026 if he hadn\u2019t been facing him.

His smile and the expression of interest on his face was no longer there. In fact, it was plainly visible to everyone that he was in shock.\u201c\u2026He blocked it,\u201d said BaekLim.He\u2019d had a feeling that YuWon did, but it was now confirmed as YuWon was unveiled amidst the parting smoke.[You blocked 3 techniques from \u2018The Fist Lord \u2013 Pung BaekLim.\u2019][You have passed the 2nd test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.]A message popped up.YuWon rubbed the back of one of his hands. Because he blocked the attack head-on, the electricity that he wasn\u2019t able to stop or brush off ended up partially paralyzing him.But that was it. YuWon had managed to block three techniques from the Fist Lord without any major injuries, even though the Fist Lord had given it his all.\u2018So this is the power of combining martial arts and skills,\u2019 YuWon thought.YuWon had only ever properly seen it a few times before.The techniques that BaekLim displayed were no ordinary techniques. He was a martial artist who was born inside the Heavenly Demonic Cult, but like YuWon, he was a player and a Ranker that climbed the Tower. Naturally, he\u2019d have dozens, if not hundreds of skills that he\u2019d learned from the time that he\u2019d spent climbing the Tower and mastering mana. And the three techniques that he\u2019d used were the result of harmonizing the skills he\u2019d mastered.Tmp, tmp\u2014\u201cI thought that you might be able to block it,\u201d BaekLim said while walking towards YuWon. He no longer saw meaning in using large techniques from a distance. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect you to come out this unscathed.\u201dThe way BaekLim looked at YuWon changed. And the air around him started to change as well\u2026Vzzt, crackle\u2014Though it was faint, it was a sign of the penalty enacting itself. It meant that BaekLim was preparing to use his maximum power.\u201cDo you want to continue?\u201d BaekLim asked.YuWon had cleared the test. If YuWon refused, BaekLim had no right to forcefully continue it, and he\u2019d then face the full effect of the penalty every time he attacked YuWon, not to mention that he\u2019d be going against the Heavenly Demon\u2019s will.However\u2026For more_novel, visit lightnovelworld.com[Would you like to continue this test?]YuWon was very much willing to agree with the Fist Lord\u2019s wishes.\u201cOf course,\u201d YuWon said.YuWon had yet to put away his sword.BaekLim smiled wide. He looked at YuWon, his eyes filled with fighting spirit.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201dBang\u2014!BaekLim smashed his two fists together, scaring the audience with the resulting thunderous sound.\u201cLet\u2019s keep playing.\u201dSpark, crackle\u2014YuWon thought maybe this would be how Hargaan would be like when he eventually became a Ranker. The electricity that flowed from his fists felt like it would burn him just from being too close.BaekLim no longer intended on judging YuWon while being restrained by the restrictions of the test. He intended to exchange hits with YuWon, not caring about the number of techniques used.\u201cNow, why don\u2019t you attack fir\u2014\u201d BaekLim trailed off. As he was about to let YuWon have the first move, his face that had been full of excitement soured.Crackle, flicker\u2014The electricity flowing around him started to waver.BaekLim could see a faint heat shimmering right before YuWon\u2019s eyes. It was some sort of physical manifestation of internal energy, no, mana.Though it was half-baked, BaekLim could tell what it was right away. No, he could feel what it was.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d BaekLim said, pointing towards YuWon, his hand wavering ever so slightly. \u201cHow are you able to use the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bit lacking to call it the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit just yet,\u201d YuWon boldly responded. \u201cThis is still nothing more than the shape of its base form.\u201d\u201cShape?\u201d\u201cShaped, also known as materialized mana. It\u2019s a thing that has a will of its own,\u201d YuWon said, looking at the heat shimmers that were forming around him. \u201cThis is merely a shell of the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit, and an incomplete one at that.\u201dThe heat shimmers moved in a way that seemed like they were protecting YuWon, as if they actually had a will of their own.Seeing this, BaekLim instinctively recoiled.Crackle, crackle\u2014The electricity weakening around BaekLim was a sign of him wavering.The BaekLim that looked like he was ready to punch YuWon at any moment suddenly seemed to have lost his morale.\u2018Luckily, it appears to be effective,\u2019 thought YuWon.Pung BaekLim, the Fist Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. He and the rest of the Four Lords were people that were born and raised inside the Cult where they had also learned martial arts. With exceptional talent for martial arts, they were among the few players that became stronger not by leveling up, but by training their martial arts. And that is how they had become Rankers, by mastering the martial arts of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2018The Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit is the root and foundation of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. It\u2019s the materialization of the martial arts mastered by the Heavenly Demon, Cheon MuJin,\u2019 YuWon thought.Tmp\u2014YuWon took a step towards Pung BaekLim.YuWon could feel BaekLim\u2019s instinctive repulsion against the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit,] even if it was incomplete. He could feel BaekLim\u2019s energy wavering.\u2018If this was the real Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit, I would be able to make him obey me with just a single sentence,\u2019 thought YuWon.The Heavenly Demon had absolute power and authority inside the Heavenly Demonic Cult, and the reason why he was worshipped as a god lied here\u2014the martial artists of the Heavenly Demonic Cult could not defy the Heavenly Demon no matter what.\u2018I can only hold the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit for three, four minutes at best.\u2019Vzzt\u2014Follow current_novel on lightnovelworld.comYuWon walked closer to BaekLim while extracting as much power out of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d as possible.\u2018Since I don\u2019t have too much time\u2026\u2019\u201cAs you asked, I\u2019ll make the first move.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: Chapter 60Rumble, crash\u2014!Boom\u2014!As the fist and sword clashed, the blastwave and mana rippled out in all directions.The Fist Lord Pung BaekLim\u2019s fist was wavering. Currently, he was fighting YuWon with all he had.\u201cFight fairly, YuWon!\u201d shouted the Fist Lord.This was due to the faint energy of the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] that was emanating from YuWon.\u201cBut I\u2019m not doing anything underhanded, sir,\u201d replied Yuwon.Vzzzt\u2014!The energy of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d fired out of YuWon\u2019s sword as he pushed away the Fist Lord. And in that short instance, they traded blows.[You blocked The Fist Lord Pung BaekLim\u2019s 47th technique.]Naturally, messages regarding the continuation of the test popped up in front of YuWon.That\u2019s right. This was a test. A test where YuWon had to block only three techniques.Everyone in the Heavenly Demonic Cult had thought this was an impossible test, yet despite that\u2026\u201cIs that the real Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit?\u201d\u201cIt seems so.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t even have a proper form, but\u2026\u201dYuWon was putting up an even fight against the Fist Lord.\u201c\u2026 How?\u201d\u201cI heard he spent a whole month in the martial arts library. He must have obtained it there.\u201d\u201cIs that where the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit is?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing more than the bare-minimum form, but even if it\u2019s just the shell, it\u2019s still the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t hard to figure out where YuWon had obtained the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.] His whereabouts the past three months were no secret. However, that didn\u2019t mean YuWon\u2019s achievement was easy to discredit.\u201cThis is just the second test, yet he\u2019s managed to get his hands on the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit\u2026\u201dThe Sword Lord shivered, watching the energy radiating off of YuWon. He couldn\u2019t believe this was a player that had just now reached the 10th Floor.Other players, even with the help of the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit,] would have barely managed to stop three techniques from the Fist Lord. Actually, it was hard to even be sure of that.The [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] might have had an absolute advantage over the martial arts of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, but this was nothing more than a shell of the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] at its most basic level. On the other hand, the Fist Lord was a Ranker who had been to the top of the Tower.Despite that, YuWon was currently using that [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] to fight on equal footing with the Fist Lord.\u201cIt\u2019s quite possible\u2026\u201d the Sword Lord said while watching YuWon dash towards the Fist Lord, \u201cthat he might actually be worthy.\u201d* * *Crash\u2014!Another attack was traded.YuWon winced at the pain in his wrists. It was truly an awe-inspiring brute force.[You blocked The Fist Lord Pung BaekLim\u2019s 59th technique.]Thwump\u2014!The Fist Lord was flung back as far as YuWon was. He had become weaker due to the influence of the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit,] but as time went on, his attacks were intensifying.\u2018Is he getting used to it?\u201d though YuWon.Even for the Fist Lord, this was the first time he had fought against the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.] It was only natural for him to be caught off-guard and fumble while reacting to it at first because, even for him, overcoming the uncomfortable feeling of aiming an attack at the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] was no easy task.The latest_episodes are on_the lightnovelworld.com website.However, if that was the only factor, it didn\u2019t explain how quickly the Fist Lord was becoming stronger.\u2018It\u2019s either that or my Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit is weakening.\u2019It was most likely a combination of the two.Vzzt\u2014A spark flew off of the Fist Lord\u2019s body that wasn\u2019t from his attack.\u2018The penalty,\u2019 YuWon thought.YuWon could instinctively feel the next attack was going to be a big one. So he stopped himself mid-swing and tightly gripped his sword with both hands. On top of that, he activated [Gigantification] and maximized the power output of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300dFlash\u2014!Crash\u2014!The sword rang from the heavy impact.\u201cKgh\u2026\u201dYuwon\u2019s wrists ached again. Had he been using an ordinary sword, it would have been shattered into pieces.\u2018I should thank Ahjussi,\u2019 YuWon thought.Whirr, whirrrr\u2014At the same time, three [Mana Blasts] appeared around YuWon and the Fist Lord.The Fist Lord had known that YuWon was preparing a [Mana Blast,] yet he still ran at him, not caring about it.[Colossal Fire x Mana Blast]Boom, kaboom\u2014!Fire rained down upon the Fist Lord.YuWon widened the gap between them by a few steps.The Fist Lord\u2019s body was very lightly scorched.\u201cYou\u2019re really sturdy,\u201d remarked YuWon.\u201cBe proud of the fact that you even managed to hurt me this much,\u201d the Fist Lord snapped back.Fwoo\u2014With just a swing of his hand, he blew away the fire YuWon started with the [Mana Blasts.] It was clear that he wasn\u2019t a Ranker just for show.Unless the Fist Lord excessively exerted his power and got greatly impacted by the penalty, it wasn\u2019t possible for YuWon to do proper damage against him by just using mana.\u2018If only the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit was slightly more complete\u2026\u2019YuWon shook his head while thinking of a few hypotheticals. His opponent wasn\u2019t a brand new Ranker like Chryses.To begin with, fighting the Fist Lord wasn\u2019t a part of YuWon\u2019s plan.Tak, tak\u2014The Fist Lord patted down his clothes, more bothered that his martial arts uniform was scorched over his actual body.\u201cI can\u2019t believe this,\u201d the Fist Lord spoke in a baffled tone. \u201cFor me, Pung BaekLim, to be unable to defeat a greenhorn that just arrived on the 10th Floor.\u201dHis words came from a place of pride over his skills, but anyone would have felt that way if they were in his shoes.The players of the Tower called the players that haven\u2019t been able to overcome the roadblock that is the 10th Floor \u2018newbies.\u2019 And technically YuWon was a newbie, even if he was on his way to clearing the 10th Floor.In a fight between a newbie and a Ranker, the result was obvious. That was why this test had the hidden piece the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit,] as well as a limit of three techniques. Despite that\u2026\u201cThis kind of put a dent in my self-esteem,\u201d the Fist Lord said while laughing out loud. Unlike earlier, this was a genuine laugh.YuWon got into a stance. He didn\u2019t have any more time to play around.Follow new_episodes on the lightnovelworld.com platform.\u201cThe Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit must be running out, seeing as how you\u2019re rushing,\u201d the Fist Lord said.Of course the Fist Lord knew. It wasn\u2019t a big secret. No matter how much of a genius YuWon was, it would be an impossible task for anyone to use the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] perfectly after having spent only a month learning it. So, naturally, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to hold the technique for a long time.\u201cCome at me with all you\u2019ve got,\u201d said the Fist Lord.Fortunately for YuWon, the Fist Lord\u2019s personality worked to his favor. He was a man that didn\u2019t know how to dodge. This was the reason why YuWon had picked the Fist Lord over the long-reaching Spear or the pretty standard Sword and Dao Lords.The Fist Lord wanted to defeat YuWon before his [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] ended. He thought that would be the only way to recover at least a little bit of his pride.Thump\u2014!The Fist Lord jumped.YuWon in turn moved like a dancer.Thud, crash\u2014!\u201cI don\u2019t know where you learned such a thing, but that is also excellent!\u201d the Fist Lord shouted while throwing out punches to break through YuWon\u2019s defenses.As their duel went on longer, bigger beads of sweat ran down YuWon\u2019s forehead. And the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] that was being maintained behind him started to become fainter.YuWon was at his limits.\u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 he thought.Fsss\u2014The shape of the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] behind Yuwon disappeared. And at the same time, the force behind the Fist Lord\u2019s punch changed.Blast\u2014!It was an impact that felt like it could instantly snap his sword in half.Krrrrk\u2014YuWon\u2019s body was pushed far back.[You blocked The Fist Lord Pung BaekLim\u2019s 89th technique.]The Fist Lord must have noticed the disappearance of the awkward feeling. He stopped for a second, opening and closing his fist, measuring his strength. Soon after, a smile came to his face.\u201cFinally, things get to be fun,\u201d said the Fist Lord.\u201cBut things just became un-fun for me.\u201d\u201cHahah! We\u2019re just getting started. Don\u2019t get wimpy on me now!\u201dWhoosh\u2014The only thing YuWon could see was the punch coming towards him.He swung his sword, cutting in right between his face and the Fist Lord\u2019s fist.Boom\u2014!YuWon flew back a distance of ten steps. For a second, he felt his body leave the ground.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dYuWon noticed the clear difference. It was evident to him how much the Fist Lord had been bothered by the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.]\u2018He\u2019s like a completely different person,\u2019 he thought.YuWon had to make a decision, stat. A full-frontal fight was no longer an option.[Cinder Eyes]Fwoosh\u2014YuWon focused on maximizing the power of [Cinder Eyes.]Whoosh\u2014Visit lightnovelworld.com for a better_reading experienceHe could see it. The Fist Lord\u2019s punch headed straight at him.YuWon dodged the punch and tried to swing back, but\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t have enough time,\u2019 he thought.Crash\u2014!He saw a punch coming in from the left. These movements were much more rapid than earlier.YuWon felt a chill down his entire spine. He knew that if he took even a single hit, it would be bad.Although he did have a pretty high Constitution, compared to his Strength or Arcane Power, it wasn\u2019t all that impressive.Just two hits. That\u2019s all it would take for YuWon to be pummeled completely.\u2018And that\u2019s only if I manage to block it using Gigantification.\u2019YuWon looked at the Fist Lord\u2019s eyes. He watched his eyes and his two hands and his feet. He tried to not miss a single movement of his muscles.\u201cAre you only going to dodge now?\u201d said the Fist Lord.He looked like he didn\u2019t care either way. To begin with, it was nonsensical that YuWon was fighting him toe-to-toe. And now that the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] had worn off, the Fist Lord was confident that YuWon was no longer going to fight him head-on.\u201cAlright. Fine. Let\u2019s see how long you can keep this up.\u201dVzzzt\u2014Accepting the penalty, the Fist Lord continued to gather his ki. Large sparks flew around his hands while the martial arts training grounds started to become filled with his electric ki.\u201cFist Lord!\u201d\u201cThis is beyond what is allowed in the rules\u2014\u201dThe Dao and Spear Lords tried to stop the Fist Lord, but the Sword Lord held them back.\u201cLet\u2019s just watch.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cEven the Heavenly Demon is simply spectating.\u201dWith that, the Dao Lord and the Spear Lord finally noticed Cheon MuJin, the Heavenly Demon, watching the fight from the sidelines.This was, of course, not the only reason why the Sword Lord stopped the other two. \u201cThe one taking the test doesn\u2019t want it to stop either,\u201d he said.This test was being held because of YuWon. He was the examinee, and he had in fact already passed the test. The only reason this fight was continuing was because he had chosen to. If he wanted to give up, he could at any moment. But\u2026\u2018The fact that he hasn\u2019t means that he still has something up his sleeve,\u2019 the Sword Lord thought.The first three techniques were dodged or blocked. After that, he fought head-on using the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.] And now that the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] had worn off, this would be the best opportunity to properly check his skills.\u2018To neither be surprised nor afraid despite facing the power of a Ranker\u2026\u2019 the Sword Lord pondered while looking at YuWon\u2019s eyes. \u2018He really is indeed\u2026\u2019Rumble\u2014!The sound erupted from the fist that had gathered as much electric ki as it could.The Fist Lord took a step towards YuWon, his fighting spirit at its peak.Stomp\u2014!With a single step, he dug a hole into the ground.At the same time, YuWon started walking towards the Fist Lord.\u2018He\u2019s not avoiding me?\u2019 the Fist Lord thought in surprise.The [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] had already worn off. YuWon no longer had a way to defend himself. He had assumed with how much power he had gathered, YuWon would naturally try to dodge it, but instead, Yuwon walked into his attack range.Smirk\u2014The Fist Lord could feel it. This was a short yet much longer duel than he had originally anticipated. But all things must come to an end.Updated_at lightnovelworld.com\u201cAlright,\u201d the Fist Lord said. \u201cLet\u2019s end this.\u201dTo that end, the Fist Lord shot out a single punch.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On top of that, he\u2019d even fought Suruhtra while risking death.The reason for this was quite simple. It was because [Gigantification] was that valuable of a skill. And among the effects of [Gigantification]\u2026[All the power of a Giant becomes concentrated in your right arm.][Your Strength stat is temporarily converted into Constitution.]\u2026 This also existed.Fwoosh\u2014!YuWon extended his arm.The Fist Lord\u2019s eyes widened while watching YuWon\u2019s hand come at him.\u201cWhat the\u2014?!\u201dThe force of the Fist Lord\u2019s fist got absorbed by YuWon\u2019s palm.Boom\u2014!Crack, snap\u2014Planting both of his legs firmly into the ground, Yuwon managed to stop the Fist Lord\u2019s punch with his hand.The Fist Lord heard YuWon\u2019s wrist snap, but that was all he managed to do to YuWon. For a second, his face turned white. For YuWon to actually stop him\u2026\u2018At this distance\u2026?\u2019 The Fist Lord thought.With this unexpected situation, the Fist Lord\u2019s judgement slowed down.YuWon normally held his sword with his right hand, but now YuWon\u2019s right hand was holding the Fist Lord\u2019s fist. That meant YuWon\u2019s sword right now was\u2026Vzzt\u2014The energy of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal\u300d went from his right hand, through his body, into his left hand.On reflex, the Fist Lord followed the path of the energy with his eyes.Slash\u2014!While holding on tightly to the Fist Lord\u2019s fist, YuWon slashed his chest.Pshhk\u2014Blood spilled out from the cut. The wound wasn\u2019t that deep, but it was enough to drench the Fist Lord\u2019s hand when he touched the wound.With no longer enough strength to hold onto the Fist Lord\u2019s hand, YuWon let go of him.The Fist lord took a few steps back, looking at the blood on the palm of his hand.For having been a direct cut, there wasn\u2019t that much blood. But the problem was that he had actually been inflicted with a wound.The Fist Lord couldn\u2019t believe he let a 10th Floor player draw blood\u2026 \u2018No, maybe the problem was that I gave him an opening to attack my chest?\u201dThis whole situation was baffling to him. If there had been more force behind YuWon\u2019s slash just now or if YuWon had had a bit more time to raise his levels and stats just a smidge more\u2026 If that were the case\u2026\u201cDid I\u2026 lose?\u201d the Fist Lord said. He was absolutely stumped, lowering both fists.YuWon\u2019s right arm, which had taken a direct blow from a punch he threw while accepting the penalty, was limp and broken.It was obvious the Fist Lord would be the victor if they continued to fight like this. However\u2026\u201cThis seems to be my loss,\u201d the Fist Lord said.Try the lightnovelworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.The fact that he had even considered winning by continuing this fight was a problem. Because this fight should have never been a real fight.Tak\u2014The Fist Lord put up both his hands to signify defeat before putting them down.This meant that\u2026[The Fist Lord \u2013 Pung BaekLim signals his defeat.][You have \u2018perfectly\u2019 cleared the 2nd test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.][You have obtained The Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit]\u2026 A miracle had happened.* * *The second test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult ended.YuWon headed to the medical house for treatment while the martial artists that came to watch the test stayed in their spot for over half a day. They were so in shock, they couldn\u2019t leave.\u201cIs this for real? Did the Fist Lord actually lose?\u201d\u201cHe would have won if he saw it through to the end\u2026 but he himself declared defeat.\u201d\u201cAre we sure he didn\u2019t go easy on him?\u201d\u201cThe test wouldn\u2019t be that easygoing. If that was possible, it\u2019s weird that not a single person has managed to pass till now.\u201d\u201cBesides, didn\u2019t you see him fight earlier? He was basically flying around.\u201d\u201cHe might already be on the level of a Ranker.\u201d\u201cI heard something earlier about the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit\u2026\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit\u2026\u201dThey went on and on about the fight between YuWon and the Fist Lord.After hearing the news that YuWon had obtained the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit,] a few of the lower-ranked martial artists headed to the martial arts library. However, none of them would likely obtain the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.]\u201cIf it was that easy, it would have been found long ago,\u201d the Sword Lord said while stroking his beard, watching the martial artists heading to the library.The [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] was the symbol of the High Ranker Cheon MuJin, A.K.A. the Heavenly Demon.There was a reason why such a great technique was inside the low-rank martial arts portion of the library. The [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] was actually not that different from your standard breathing and cultivation technique. It was nothing more than a breathing technique that allowed one to accept energy, and it was incredibly hard to discern that it was the [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] just by reading it.\u2018Not to mention, mastering it is a whole other story,\u2019 the Sword Lord thought.He wondered how many of these people running towards the library actually possessed the \u2018eyes\u2019 to discern it. And even if they did find it, how many of them would actually be capable of learning it? One? Perhaps two? It was also entirely possible that none of them could.On top of that\u2026The Sword Lord thought, \u2018From the perspective of the Cult, we can no longer just leave the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit there.\u2019Even if it was just a shell of the technique, the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit was still a symbol of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Now that people knew where it was, the Cult couldn\u2019t just leave it there.\u201cSo he was thinking about counter-attacking that entire time\u2026\u201d The Fist Lord mumbled while opening and closing his hands, recapping the fight in his mind.The Sword Lord\u2019s eyes darted over to the Fist Lord, who was mumbling while staring down at his palm.\u201cFist Lord,\u201d MuGuek said, walking over to BaekLim, who was still standing at the center of the training ground. \u201cDon\u2019t be too embarrassed about this. No one could have foreseen him having learned the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.\u201dThe Sword Lord said that to console him, but the Fist Lord had an unexpected reaction.\u201cEmbarrassed?\u201d the Fist Lord said with an oddly proud look on his face.Try the lightnovelworld.com platform_for the most advanced_reading experience.After seeing the Fist Lord\u2019s expression, the Sword Lord was reminded how much the Fist Lord enjoyed fighting, and he realized how much this fight might actually have been stimulating and enjoyable for him.\u201cHe\u2019s going to become a High Ranker one day,\u201d the Fist Lord declared.\u201cMost likely.\u201d\u201cAnd he\u2019s probably going to surpass our leader.\u201dAfter a moment of silence, the Sword Lord nodded his head. He couldn\u2019t deny it.Even the Heavenly Demon, one of the High Rankers that ruled the Tower, probably couldn\u2019t have fought against a Ranker like this when he was at the 10th Floor.\u201cIt\u2019s honestly an honor, having gotten to have such a fun fight against a guy like that.\u201dHearing the Fist Lord\u2019s response, the Sword Lord understood his feeling.\u201cI see.\u201dSeeing how the Fist Lord wasn\u2019t feeling down at all, the Sword Lord decided to stop worrying. Right now what was important wasn\u2019t how the Fist Lord might have been feeling.\u2018Soon\u2026\u2019 the Sword Lord thought while looking at the empty spot where the Heavenly Demon had stood. \u2018Soon the Lord will go find him.\u2019There was only a single test left, and that test was probably going to be conducted by the Heavenly Demon himself.* * *YuWon received treatment at the medical house. He only needed to receive treatment for his right arm. While blocking the Fist Lord\u2019s final punch, a few of the broken bones had pierced through the skin.\u201cAll done.\u201dJin Il-Hwan, the chief doctor, finished treating YuWon\u2019s injury and rubbed the little medicinal herbs they had left on it.This made YuWon realize how much of the medical ingredients he\u2019d actually taken and gobbled up.\u2018For them to not even have a single potion\u2026\u2019 he thought.Health potions were such a common item, you could even buy them off of Lackeys, yet they didn\u2019t have even a single one because YuWon had depleted all of the Cult\u2019s supply to consume \u300cOrochi\u2019s Heart.\u300d\u2018I guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019On the 10th Floor, the Heavenly Demonic Cult was considered the boonies. Lackeys were merchants at heart, so they didn\u2019t operate in remote areas like this. In order to purchase medicine from a Lackey with potions, he\u2019d have to walk pretty far.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have trouble moving within a few days. Be careful until the bones heal back together, and regularly\u2014\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d YuWon said, leaving before the boring explanation got too long.Il-Hwan looked at YuWon for a second, figured he\u2019d probably be okay, and waved goodbye.YuWon knew that it would take about two days for his arm to heal without any proper medicine, like the doctor told him. But for broken bones and torn flesh, it would be a pretty fast recovery.Holding his splint, YuWon returned back to his lodgings.Waiting for the next test, he rested his head on his bed. While laying down, he recapped his fight against the Fist Lord.\u2018It was shallow.\u2019The sensation of his left hand cutting into the Fist Lord\u2019s chest.Though he was ambidextrous, YuWon predominantly used his right hand. Due to that, there would have been an inevitable difference in power. However, the reason the cut was shallow wasn\u2019t just due to the difference between his right and left hands.In order to leave a dent on a Ranker\u2019s body, you needed something extra.\u2018It really sucks not having hit triple digits with my Arcane Power.\u2019[Arcane Power : 98]Just two.

An A-rank was enough for most Rankers to desire it.It was likely that the Heavenly Demon mastered this skill, reaching 100% proficiency with it.\u2018So this is the skill I obtained at the midpoint.\u2019Thinking about the difficulty of the test, it was a lackluster reward, but YuWon didn\u2019t think of it like that.The [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] was a skill YuWon had obtained by \u2018perfectly\u2019 passing the second test. It was a separate reward from the one he got by officially taking the test. On top of that, he wasn\u2019t fully done with the tests.The [Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit] was definitely a great skill, but\u2026\u2018The test isn\u2019t over yet.\u2019And right on cue\u2026\u201cKim YuWon-nim.\u201dA female attendant came to YuWon, who was resting in his lodgings.\u201cThe Heavenly Demon is calling for you.\u201d* * *Guided by the attendant, YuWon was led to the deepest part of the Cult.The Heavenly Demon YuWon remembered was someone that didn\u2019t care for formalities and disliked complicated things.

YuWon didn\u2019t think that the Heavenly Demon would leave the place after calling him here. There was only a single reason YuWon could think of as to why he couldn\u2019t sense his presence.\u2018He\u2019s as sluggish as always.\u2019With YuWon\u2019s current skills, it was impossible for him to sense the presence of a High Ranker like the Heavenly Demon.

He was a living piece of history of the martial realm, as well as a High Ranker and the 'sky\u201d\u00a0of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.After attaining the position of a High Ranker through personal strength and the power of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, he had become a recluse in Mt. Heaven, stopping all external activities.The only thing he did was oversee the tests, but as not a single person had passed the test, some even speculated that he might have died.\u201cI heard you called for me,\u201d YuWon said while looking straight at MuJin.He was a tall figure, towering over 2 meters.* His shoulders were wide, and he was wearing a bright red dragon robe that covered his entire body. He had a short beard that covered his jawline all the way up to his hairline. And his eyes were sharp, as if they could cut.*PR/N: 6\u20196.7\u201dDespite sitting down, his eyes were almost level with YuWon\u2019s, so YuWon waited for him to speak without sitting down.\u201cIs your arm okay?\u201dYuWon responded to MuJin\u2019s question while shaking his arm, \u201cAs you can see.\u201d[Under the influence of night, your health regeneration speed increases.][Health Regeneration Speed : +102%]YuWon\u2019s sword, \u300cEdge of Nightfall,\u300d was a sword that really shone in darkness. Its effect of accelerating health and mana recovery allowed YuWon to start healing quicker once it had become night.\u201cThat\u2019s a good sword. It makes me want it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s not as good as the sword you own, sir.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m quite greedy in that regard.\u201dDespite being unmaterialistic for the most part, MuJin was quite greedy when it came to swords. Due to that, for a while there was even a rumor that the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s vault actually stored many of the weapons that had disappeared from the Tower.\u201cSorry, but this is off limits. There\u2019s an ahjussi that\u2019d chew me out for failing to maintain my own weapon.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about Hephaestus? He certainly has the right to do that.\u201d\u201cYou know Ahjussi?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t, but I have had the opportunity to wield a few swords that he\u2019s made.\u201dMuJin\u2019s greed for swords was greater than expected. Hephaestus\u2019s swords were something that were hard to buy regardless of how many points you had. So to have wielded multiple of his swords before\u2026\u201cSo why did you call for me?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re quite impatient.\u201d\u201cYou know what they say, \u2018time is money.\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not a bad mindset,\u201d MuJin said while getting up from his seat.With his over 2-meter-tall stature, YuWon almost felt like he was face-to-face with a Giant.\u201cLet\u2019s start the final test right away,\u201d MuJin continued.It was an unexpected response.YuWon said while shaking his broken arm, \u201cMy arm\u2019s still like this.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were okay?\u201d\u201cI meant that it was okay for me to move. I\u2019m still in no condition to fight,\u201d YuWon rebutted. If possible, YuWon wanted to take the test while he was at his peak condition. That way he could attain the best possible result. Because of that, YuWon wanted to avoid taking the test right now if possible, but\u2026\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d MuJin said while quickly turning around and walking away. \u201cYou won\u2019t have to use that arm anyway.\u201dTmp, tmp\u2014MuJin headed over to an empty wall with nothing.Confused by MuJin\u2019s claim that he wouldn\u2019t need his arm, YuWon wondered why MuJin had walked towards the wall.That was when\u2026Vwoom\u2014With a small shimmer, MuJin disappeared.\u2018Is it a barrier?\u2019 YuWon wondered.[Cinder Eyes]YuWon quickly used [Cinder Eyes] to investigate the spot where MuJin disappeared.His hunch was right. Where MuJin had been, there was a small trace of a barrier.\u2018This is different from the one that\u2019s at the bottom of Mt. Heaven. It\u2019s much more precise and complicated\u2026\u2019\u201cWhat are you doing? Why aren\u2019t you entering?\u201d It was MuJin\u2019s voice.Pressed by the Heavenly Demon, YuWon carefully walked into the barrier. Fortunately, the first step wasn\u2019t hard to take, revealing a large open area where he\u2019d thought a wall existed.Riiiing\u2014A noise rang inside his ears, and for a second his head became dizzy.[Cinder Eyes tries to resist Requiem Barrier.][Cinder Eyes fails to resist Requiem Barrier.]A barrier so powerful, [Cinder Eyes] couldn\u2019t resist it.\u2018I can\u2019t break through this.\u2019If he lost his focus for even a second, he\u2019d fall prey to the illusion of the barrier.That was when\u2026Grasp\u2014A big hand grabbed his shoulder and yanked him inside.[You\u2019ve entered the Heavenly Demonic Cave.][The final test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult will begin.]His spinning vision returned back to normal.

It was a cave.MuJin started striding forward.YuWon started a fire to light up the dark, humid cave, holding it above his hand like a torch.His tensions were at an all-time high as he followed MuJin.\u201cDid you learn the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit?\u201d MuJin asked.YuWon responded, \u201cYes. It was turned into a skill,\u201d while walking behind MuJin.\u201cThen it\u2019ll probably be easier to handle now. The world\u2019s become a much better place.\u201dHe sounded like an old grandpa, but YuWon could understand where MuJin was coming from. MuJin was one of the oldest Rankers alive, an Ancient Ranker.\u201cYou\u2019re an excellent fighter,\u201d MuJin threw out a sudden compliment. \u201cTake good care of it.\u201d\u201cTake care?\u201d YuWon asked in confusion, but he didn\u2019t get a response back.YuWon didn\u2019t understand what MuJin could have meant by \u2018take care.\u2019Tmp, tmp\u2014Inside the quiet cave, the footsteps of the two echoed loudly.Fwoosh\u2014The fire in YuWon\u2019s hand flickered, even though there was no wind.And that wasn\u2019t the only thing.[\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d bares its fangs.][\u300c?\u2019s Egg\u300d salivates.]The Egg started having a reaction.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Towards the end of the Heavenly Demonic Cave, a light could be seen in the distance, a purple, flickering light.It was a sensation that was similar yet different from mana.\u2018There really was something here.\u2019It was so faint, he could only feel it now that he\u2019d gotten this close to it, but Yuwon was sure that this was a power that came from outside the Tower.The Egg on the other hand had detected it much earlier.\u2018It\u2019s acting like some kind of Dragon Ball\u2122 radar.\u2019As he got closer to the fire, YuWon could see the identity of the light.It was a \u2018fire.\u2019[Colossal Fire is\u00a0shaken\u00a0by a mysterious power.]A purple, shimmering fire.The fire wasn\u2019t that large. It was only the size of an adult male\u2019s fist, and it floated up in the air like some sort of will o\u2019 wisp.He couldn\u2019t feel any heat coming off of it, but YuWon felt an instinctive repulsion to the fire. It felt like just by getting close to it, his entire body would be burnt to cinders.YuWon only managed to shake off the tension in his chest by taking deep breaths.MuJin spoke while staring at the fire, \u201cThis is the \u2018Holy Fire.\u2019\u201d\u201cHoly Fire?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what we call it.\u201dA holy fire. YuWon thought how simple of a name it was. And in his memory, there were quite a few skills with that name.\u2018It doesn\u2019t even feel like a holy power,\u2019 YuWon thought.He thought the name was flawed to begin with, but there was nothing he could do about it. A name wasn\u2019t always decided by something\u2019s true properties but rather just by how people had decided to call it.If this thing was called \u2018Holy Fire\u2019 for a long time, then the system would have already recognized this power as Holy Fire.\u201cThere\u2019s an old prophecy that\u2019s been passed down from long ago, since the Cult decided to settle down on Mt. Heaven and discovered this fire. The Cult exists to protect this fire and find its master,\u201d MuJin spoke with a sorrowful smile. \u201cThe first Heavenly Demon of the cult, the second Heavenly Demon, and even my master, they all passed after\u00a0living for this purpose. It is the same for me as well.\u201d\u201cA prophecy\u2026 I\u2019m having a hard time relating to it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a boring old tale that can\u2019t keep up with the times. But believing and following such things is a common habit among geezers like me.\u201d\u201cDo you truly believe in the prophecy?\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly Demonic Cult is a religion first and foremost before it is a martial school. And religion is something where the foundation will falter when faith wavers.\u201dMuJin\u2019s faith in the Cult did not waver an inch while answering YuWon\u2019s question. Despite having lived a much longer life than his predecessors, he still placed all his faith in the Cult.\u201cHowever, in this Tower, there are factions much larger than the Cult, and there are also people much stronger than me. That\u2019s why I had no choice but to use a trick to protect the Holy Fire from them.\u201d\u201cIs that why you created a test with the Holy Fire as a reward?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Thanks to that, the difficulty has become like this.\u201dAsking a 10th Floor player to nullify an illusory barrier. Making them last through a fight against a Ranker. YuWon finally understood how this unbelievably difficult test came to be.\u2018By using the test as a guise, he could hide and protect the Holy Fire,\u2019 YuWon thought while staring at the flame floating mid-air.\u201cHas anyone ever managed to make it this far?\u201d\u201cThe Sword Lord. He\u2019s seen this before.\u201dPurple light could be seen reflecting in MuJin\u2019s eyes as he stared at the Holy Fire.\u201c\u2026 But he didn\u2019t manage to beat it.\u201dThat was only natural. The power of an Outer God wasn\u2019t something that a player who had just climbed to the 10th Floor could win against. It was a fire that even a Ranker would have a hard time beating, so of course the Sword Lord couldn\u2019t do it as a normal player.\u201cHowever, this is most likely not an impossible test. If that was the case, the Administrator wouldn\u2019t have allowed this test to exist,\u201d MuJin said while looking at YuWon. \u201cThis is the final test.\u201dFwoosh\u2014!With those words, the Holy Fire that was only the size of a fist started to grow larger.\u201cSurvive through this fire. Endure it\u2026\u201dFwoo, fwoosh\u2014The fire slowly grew larger and larger.YuWon still couldn\u2019t feel any actual heat, but it still felt like it might swallow and melt YuWon to the bones at any moment.\u201c\u2026 Until you are acknowledged by the Holy Fire.\u201d[Endure the Holy Fire.][When you surrender, this test will end.]Messages popped up with the announcement of what the test was.YuWon looked at the purple, shimmering fire.The Holy Fire quickly grew in size, already reaching the roof of the cave. Without even needing to move, it felt like the fire would soon swallow him.Fwoo, fwoosh\u2014The fire grew larger and larger.MuJin stared at the purple sea of flames before looking over at YuWon.\u2018So it\u2019s hard even for him,\u2019 MuJin thought.Needing to walk into such a fire. It was honestly a ridiculous test.There was a tale of the Great Sage Son OhGong enduring over 40 days inside an Eight Trigram Crucible. However, that was a test given to OhGong when he was nearing the top of the Tower.\u2018It was the same way for Shin MuGuek.\u2019The Sword Lord Shin MuGuek managed to get directly in front of the Holy Fire. However, he was unable to actually challenge the test.It was because of fear.\u2018It might be better for him to give up. This is a fire that can even swallow a Ranker.\u2019MuJin knew very well that this was a difficult test. Even if YuWon had the skills to take on the Fist Lord\u2019s punches, he was still just a normal human in front of this mysterious power.\u2018Still, he managed to obtain the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit, so\u2026\u2019In the midst of MuJin\u2019s train of thought\u2026Tmp\u2014YuWon, who had only been silently staring at the Holy Fire, started to walk forward.

On top of that, the Holy Fire circled around YuWon like will o\u2019 wisps.YuWon looked at the Holy Fire that split into three pieces.Unable to believe what was happening, MuJin quickly went over to YuWon and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d MuJin looked at YuWon\u2019s eyes.YuWon didn\u2019t look back at MuJin. Staring at the Holy Fire, YuWon\u2019s eyes seemed hazy and out of focus.And after a moment\u2026Ssk\u2014YuWon slowly collapsed forward.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *With his closed eyes, he couldn\u2019t see anything. But from within the darkness, YuWon felt like he was floating in zero gravity.Fwoosh\u2014And in the darkness, a purple fire floated up. It was the Holy Fire.The Holy Fire that floated around like a will o\u2019 wisp slowly drifted around his field of vision.This was a very different response than earlier.\u2018So it doesn\u2019t intend on fighting me.\u2019The Holy Fire was now following him. The appearance of the vicious monster was a temporary form for the test.\u2018Being afraid of the thing in front of me would mean that I don\u2019t have the qualifications to wield it.\u2019That was why YuWon didn\u2019t fear the Holy Fire, and that was enough.[You obtained 100,000 points.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Dexterity increased by 2.][Your Constitution increased by 1.][Your Perception increased by 1.][Your Arcane Power increased by 1.][\u2026\u2026][You passed the test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.][You have obtained a skill of a higher tier than the Colossal Fire. The skill perishes.][You have obtained Holy Fire.][You have obtained title : Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.][You have obtained the right to move on to the 11th Floor.][You are now able to teleport to the next floor.]With the ringing message, YuWon was able to confirm that the test was over.He had actually managed to obtain [Holy Fire.]Ssk\u2014His heavy eyelids slowly opened, and he could see the ceiling. YuWon was sleeping with a blanket. And it seemed to have become day, as sunlight pierced through the crack in the door.The first thing YuWon did was check the condition of his body.\u2018Do I have any burns\u2026?\u2019He patted himself down, but he felt no pain.YuWon thought back to the Holy Fire, which felt like a dream, along with the message that said he had passed the test.Next on the list was to check his newly obtained reward.[Holy Fire]\u15cc Rank : S+\u15cc Proficiency : 0.00%\u15cc A fire from [?]. Depending on the enemy\u2019s emotions, it is able to exude greater power without any additional consumption of mana.\u15cc It will not harm any targets you do not wish to hurt.\u15cc Worsens wounds.\u15cc Inextinguishable.The description of the skill wasn\u2019t far off from what he expected.A fire that grows stronger by consuming emotions\u2014it was a bit of an odd description at first glance. To begin with, there was almost no one that didn\u2019t fear fire. Unless you were a High Ranker like Apollo or Surya or a fire-controlling Giant like Surtr, fire was something that was natural to fear. And the Holy Fire was something that grew bigger by consuming fear. The skill\u2019s rank was enough to prove how powerful that was.\u2018Being able to avoid harming allies is a big boon in large-scale fights. And being able to worsen wounds is also incredibly powerful.\u2019This was enough to put it among the top fire-type skills. On top of that\u2026\u2018This is even better than obtaining just any old skill.\u2019The fact that [Holy Fire] materialized into a skill had huge meaning for YuWon.The Holy Fire was a power that came from outside the Tower, and from the long war, YuWon understood well the power that Outers had.Their powers were infinite.Because of that, there were many Rankers that sought out their powers, but none were successful. Yet here, out of all the unexpected places, YuWon had succeeded in doing that very thing.\u2018This is so far beyond enough, it\u2019s overwhelming.\u2019It was a reward that YuWon was satisfied with and worth all the time he had spent on it.But\u2026\u201c\u2018The Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019?\u201d YuWon thought back to one of the messages.To be the Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2026A \u2018title\u2019 was a person\u2019s secondary name or position. Hercule\u2019s \u201cGiant Slayer\u201d and OhGong\u2019s \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal\u201d for example.Normally, even Rankers struggled to obtain a single title, yet here YuWon had obtained one as a reward for the 10th Floor.[Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult]\u15cc Classification : Title\u15cc Rank : B\u15cc It possesses absolute dominance and command over cultists contracted to the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u15cc This title can be revoked by someone with the title of \u201cHeavenly Demon.\u201dA B-rank title.Titles were normally much harder to obtain than skills, so naturally, obtaining a high-rank title was as difficult as stealing a star from the night sky.B-rank wasn\u2019t as powerful as some of the titles that YuWon knew about, but it was still\u00a0 a pretty high-ranking title.Of course, the power of the title itself wasn\u2019t anything that impressive, but if you took the \u2018authority\u2019 into account, it became a different story.\u2018\u2026 The Heavenly Demonic Cult?\u2019The Cult was an organization that had long been facing off against the Martial Guild. Though they had become weaker from being cut off from the outside for a long time, their power was still nothing to scoff at.So it was impossible to calculate the value of a title that was capable of commandeering such an organization.YuWon got up from his spot and went outside.The female attendant that was waiting for YuWon promptly led him to the Lord\u2019s Manor.\u201cSo you\u2019re here.\u201dCheon MuJin was sitting at the same spot as yesterday in the same exact position.YuWon was already mostly finished with packing.\u201cIs it still necessary for you to stay there? It\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything to guard anymore,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cHabits aren\u2019t so easy to fix. I tried going elsewhere, but I didn\u2019t quite feel comfortable.\u201dThe Holy Fire that MuJin had to protect was no longer there. It was now something for YuWon to carry.\u201cI obtained a title.\u201d\u201cYou mean the title of Vice-Lord?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cKeep it. You\u2019re plenty qualified, possessing both the Holy Fire and the Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit.\u201d\u201cEven if I become a Ranker, I won\u2019t be joining the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201d\u201cDo as you want. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s intended to tie you down anyway. It\u2019s a reward you obtained by passing the test fair and square, so you can reap the benefits as much as you want.\u201dDespite it taking a lot of courage for YuWon to tell this to MuJin, his response was surprisingly indifferent. YuWon was worried that MuJin might pick him as the next Lord of the Cult, but it seemed that wasn\u2019t the case.That was a good thing for YuWon. He didn\u2019t have any responsibilities but could still reap all the benefits, as MuJin said.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take it gratefully,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cAre you leaving right away?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stop by again when it\u2019s time for the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.\u201d\u201cAre you thinking of participating in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m planning on it. That is, if I\u2019m still below the 25th floor by then.\u201dThe Grand Martial Arts Tournament was a tournament for players between the 10th and 25th Floors. Held three times a year, it was the most anticipated event in the lower floors.\u201cI see. So it\u2019s almost time for the Grand Martial Arts Tournament\u2026\u201d MuJin mumbled as he nodded, recollecting an old memory. \u201cI won\u2019t see you out, since you don\u2019t seem like the type that likes things like that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right on the bulls-eye.\u201dYuWon got up from his seat.He had barely anything left to pack. Rations and other necessities were all already inside his inventory.YuWon bowed his head to MuJin and left to climb up to the next floor.\u201cThe Grand Martial Arts Tournament\u2026\u201d MuJin murmured to himself again.With the Holy Fire finally finding its master, the hard shackles that had been holding him down for such a long time disappeared. MuJin, whose life mission had been protecting the Holy Fire, started wondering \u2018What should I do?\u2019 for the first time ever.That\u2019s when it came to him. The thing that the Heavenly Demonic Cult had wanted long before the Holy Fire appeared.\u201cI guess it\u2019s time to return to the Martial Realm.\u201d____Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 64The test on the 11th Floor was a team battle.Normally when you think of teams, you think five, maybe ten people on each side, but that wasn\u2019t how the 11th Floor\u2019s test was conducted.It was a test where there could be as few as 100 to as many as 200 people on each team, with the teams randomly formed from a pool of test participants.\u201cPlease this time\u2026\u201d the player Halimun mumbled while praying. He didn\u2019t believe in God, but around his time, he would always magically end up being religious.Currently, he was waiting for the test schedule.Ding\u2014He heard the ring of the message, and soon after, a giant screen popped up in front of him.The screen was dense with letters.[208 : 208]There were a total of 416 participants in this test. Since on average about 400 people participated, this was neither a large nor small number. This was actually better than having too few or too many participants and honestly not a bad number.\u2018Please\u2026\u2019However, that wasn\u2019t the important part. The really important part was the \u2018members\u2019 that participated in the test.\u2018I\u2019m on Team A. Naturally, Lars and Melly are on the same team as me. As for the other guys\u2026\u2019While looking around at the other names on screen, Halimun started to sweat.\u201cWho are all of these guys?\u201dAfter going through over a hundred names, he had only heard of a few of these guys, and all of them were pathetically unskilled.There was even someone that was blacklisted from trolling in the last test, putting their own team in danger.\u201cHoly fuck\u2026\u201dHalimun naturally ended up looking through the names on Team B.The first name was already not looking good.Lo\u2019el. As a player with a rare healing-type skill, she was already quite famous on the lower floors. And since Lo\u2019el was on the roster, that meant that her teammates should also be on Team B.\u2018Of course those guys are with her\u2026 Wait, what\u2019s this? NamGung Hoon*?\u2019*TL/N: Hoon is his first name and NamGung is his last name.This was also a terrifying name to see. Hoon was a direct Pure-Blood of the NamGung clan. It was said that there were few who were capable of rivaling him on the lower floors. That very man was a part of Team B.He was a competitor easily capable of passing the 11th Floor test. As a Pure-Blood from the Martial Realm, born from the great NamGung Clan no less, he was fundamentally different from players that first stepped into the world of the Tower through the Tutorial.\u201cWhat the hell is up with this?\u201dIt was impossible for him to not complain about this.The 11th Floor test was what some referred to as a \u2018game of RNG.*\u2019*TL/N: Random Number Generation \u2013 A process that produces numbers which are used to determine randomized elements in a game, such as team draw.The test was ultimately decided by how many skilled players were randomly selected into your team.Halimun had already failed the test three times. Not only did he lack skills, he also had shit luck when it came to his teams.But\u2026\u2018This test is going to be the worst one yet.\u2019\u2026 None had been as bad a draw as this one.Since this test was a team battle, he knew quite a few of the players\u2019 names on the 11th Floor, but somehow all the somewhat well-known, skilled players had ended up on Team B.On the other hand, it seemed that Team A was entirely comprised of useless players.\u201cWhat kind of deranged coincidence is this\u2026?\u201dIt honestly made him doubt if the teams were even really decided at random. Still not giving up yet, he continued to look through the team roster, eventually coming across a familiar name.\u2018Huh?\u2019It was a name that he could never forget, having heard it so many times recently.Halimun tilted his head, staring at the three-syllable name at the end of the Team A roster.\u2018Kim YuWon?\u2019It had been quite a bit of time since YuWon first got to the 10th Floor. From what Halimun had heard, he was attempting the test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, but as it was a test that no one had managed to pass yet, people thought he must have been struggling with it a lot.\u2018Maybe it\u2019s just someone with the same name?\u2019For YuWon alone to be on Team A while all the other skilled players were on Team B, it seemed quite unbalanced.\u2018If it actually is him, he\u2019s also pretty unlucky.\u2019It was certain that YuWon had great skills. Halimun had never seen them with his own eyes, but this was a guy that had broken record after record starting on the 1st Floor. And seeing as how he was now on the 11th Floor, he had probably also cleared the test of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.But regardless of all that, this wasn\u2019t an individual-based test. It was a team-based test with over 200 people on each team.And Teams A and B had an unprecedentedly large gap in the quality of members.\u2018Which is going to cause that many people to give up\u2026\u2019This test was doomed. Halimun was certain that even YuWon wouldn\u2019t be able to turn the tables by himself.Having confirmed all the members, Halimun turned back with no energy left in his body.The test was set to start in a week.* * *\u201cThat\u2019s really childish,\u201d YuWon said, sighing deeply after checking the members list.There were quite a few familiar names on Team B. A few of them were even talented enough to become a Ranker in the far future.On the other hand, Team A had no one he recognized.It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out why there was such a large difference between the two teams.\u2018If I remember correctly, the 11th Floor belongs to Olympus.\u2019The 11th Floor was one of the floors that Olympus had the greatest amount of influence over, and there was no way that Olympus would look kindly on the culprit that stopped them from capturing Hephaestus.\u2018The test examiner is Hypnos, one of Olympus\u2019s Rankers.\u2019Though the teams were supposed to be sorted randomly, it wasn\u2019t much of an obstacle for a skilled examiner to make some changes.Of course, this was something that if caught by an Administrator would cause them to suffer severe consequences, so it was unlikely that they\u2019d get caught by doing it once or twice. And even if an Administrator found it suspicious, they could claim that it was merely a coincidence.\u2018Ro\u2019el, NamGung Hoon, Salamov\u2026 Spyros? I think this guy is an Olympian Pure-Blood. There\u2019s also a guy from Asgard as well.\u2019Their members were stacked. Even though there weren\u2019t any High Pure-Bloods like Hargaan, there was a direct Pure-Blood of the NamGung clan, as well as countless formidable players.A test with a roster of this caliber should even grab the attention of various guilds.\u2018So they\u2019re really going all out, huh.\u2019It was as plain as day to YuWon. They wanted YuWon to fail the test as payback. And as testing sites were extraterritorial zones* where murder was allowed, they might even have a more sinister plan laid out for YuWon.*T/N: Extraterritorial zones are places such as embassies or military bases where the laws of the local region do not apply.However\u2026\u2018Well, whatever.\u2019After checking the lists of team members, YuWon simply turned away.\u2018If this is all there is\u2026\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The 11th Floor was a world named Tahklan. With over 90% of the land being mountains or forests, it wasn\u2019t all that great of an environment for people to live in. Due to that, the majority of the residents of the 11th Floor were races of the forest like Elves or Dwarves.\u201c30 points? Why does the inn cost so much?\u201d\u201cYou seem to have just arrived, but that\u2019s how things are around here. The land is flat, close to the testing site, and has good infrastructure. Did you come here without doing any research?\u201d\u201cStill\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, you\u2019re welcome to go elsewhere. I highly doubt you\u2019ll find a place cheaper than here.\u201dThis was a typical conversation you could overhear at the inns in the village near the testing site. Between the players visiting to take the test and the players that hadn\u2019t managed to buy a house yet even after obtaining a residency permit, it inflated the price of the inn to be much higher than other places.It was only natural as land that was good to live on was expensive, considering most of the land was forest or mountains.\u201cNext customer,\u201d said the inn owner Khalif, greeting the new customer with a hand on his chin.It was a new face he hadn\u2019t seen around. From his experience, most players that had just arrived on the 11th Floor had a similar reaction to the previous guy. They complained about the expensive cost of food and lodging before having no choice but to accept the facts.\u201cAre there any rooms left?\u201d the newbie asked.\u201cOf course we have rooms, but the bottom floor\u2019s full. So what do you want to do?\u201dMost of the rooms on the bottom floor were small and shabby but cost the least. In comparison, the rooms on the upper floors were larger and better maintained but were pretty pricey.The guy from before was the one who took the last 30-point room.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, give me a room on your top floor.\u201d\u201cTop\u00a0top?\u201d Khalif responded while straightening his pose, taking his hand off his chin. \u201cA room on the top floor costs 100 points.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dFor someone to not care about a 100-point room\u2026 That was an amount that, unless you were a Pure-Blood from a top guild, you could never even dream of spending on just lodging. Khalif could smell the scent of money.\u201cBy the way, this is the largest inn in this town, right?\u201d the guy asked.\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cSo you guys can do currency exchanges, right?\u201dKhalif\u2019s eyes twinkled, quickly nodding his head in response, \u201cOf course, sir. What bills are they?\u201dNot only did this customer want the most expensive room, but he also wanted to do a currency exchange. Realizing that this was a big-shot customer, Khalif\u2019s attitude did a 180, bringing his hands together and showing respect to YuWon.\u201cAsgardian,\u201d YuWon replied.Asgardian bills were the most trusted and reliable currency. Because of that, it had a low exchange fee and was welcomed practically everywhere due to there being basically no risk.\u201c384 1,000-point bills. I\u2019d like you to exchange all of it into points, minus the exchange fee of course,\u201d YuWon said while handing the innkeeper a thick white envelope.A whopping 384 Asgardian bills. Seeing them made Khalif\u2019s eyes turn white from shock.* * *[You have obtained 376,320 points.]Exchanging the bills netted YuWon a large sum, but even without this money, he was already rich because of the obscenely large amount of points he had obtained from each floor.[Total Points: 931,420p]930K points. It was an amount that even most Rankers couldn\u2019t obtain.YuWon was a bit disappointed he couldn\u2019t hit one million points, but he still thought it was plenty.\u201cHey, Lackey.\u201d[Would you like to call a Lackey?]Speaking into the player kit, a message popped up.YuWon responded to the player kit, \u201cYes.\u201d[Please wait a moment.]The wait wasn\u2019t long. Lackeys had an exceptional ability to sniff out money.\u201c> Heyo! What can I help you with?\u201dWith a bright voice, what appeared was not a pierrot, but instead was a finger-sized fairy with wings.YuWon thought the taste of the 11th Floor\u2019s Administrator was better than that of the Tutorial\u2019s Administrator. A fairy was much better to look at than a pierrot with a sickening, smiling face.\u201cIs the Shop usable right now?\u201d\u201c> Of course. Please tell me what you want. We have everything there is, except for what we don\u2019t.\u201dThe fairy was overtly friendly. It was completely different in every way from the Lackeys of the Tutorial.\u2018It\u2019s probably due to the points I have,\u2019 YuWon thought.A Lackey\u2019s main objective was \u2018points.\u2019 For providing various conveniences to a player, Lackeys took points as payment. What this meant was that as long as you had the points, you could make Lackeys do whatever you wanted.\u201c> So what do you need, sir?\u201d\u00a0the Lackey asked with a twinkle in its eyes.YuWon already knew what he needed, but he pretended to think for a moment.One of the ways to buy things cheap from a Lackey was to appear that you didn\u2019t actually need the thing.\u2018Or else they\u2019ll jack up the prices,\u2019 YuWon thought.\u201cFirst let me peruse a bit.\u201d\u201c> Of course, sir.\u201dWith a flick of the Lackey\u2019s hand, a hazy screen popped up in front of YuWon listing thousands of varieties of items.Looking around the screen nonchalantly, YuWon searched for a single item.\u2018Adamantium.\u2019It was the only material that could complete the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d\u2018I hope there\u2019s some available for sale.\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Leveling with the Gods[Translator \u2013 NumbaWon ][Proofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn ]Chapter 65Lackeys possessed a near uncountable amount of items.Some of them were even things that YuWon wished he could buy, making him wonder how a Lackey on the 11th Floor had possessed such a thing. However, YuWon wasn\u2019t so foolish as to make an impulsive purchase.As long as he could purchase some adamantium and receive Hephaestus\u2019s help, he could obtain an item far greater than what was available here.\u2018It\u2019s here.\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes twinkled before he caught himself. His facial expression almost revealed his true feelings to the Lackey.After finding the adamantium, YuWon still browsed over items, only coming back to it much later.\u201cHow much is this?\u201d he asked.[Adamantium : 1.7kg]The Lackey smiled after seeing what YuWon was pointing at.\u201c> Adamantium\u2026 Nice choice, but there are plenty of other good objects as well, so why that one?\u201d\u201cFinished items are too expensive. I thought it\u2019d be cheaper to purchase the raw materials and make something myself.\u201d\u201c> That is normally true\u2026 however, it is a bit different for adamantium.\u201dThe Lackey\u2019s eyes were smiling.YuWon could tell that something was wrong. The Lackey appeared as if it knew something.\u201c> This is an unbreakable material, and not only does it have great mana conductivity, it can even amplify mana. There\u2019s no other mineral like it in the world.\u201dThe Lackey went on a spiel, but YuWon already knew how great of a mineral adamantium was.\u2018Adamantium is the only material out there that can self-amplify mana. Taking its hardness and durability into account, it\u2019s honestly a cheat-like material,\u2019 Yuwon thought to himself.That was the reason why blacksmiths described adamantium as the material of dreams, but due to it\u2019s incredible hardness and durability, there were less than ten blacksmiths in the entire Tower that were capable of handling this mineral.\u201c> As long as you can get your hands on it, you can definitely make an amazing item out of it. Of course, there aren\u2019t many blacksmiths who can handle it\u2026\u201dAnd what would you know.\u201c> \u2026 But you\u2019re acquainted with Hephaestus, aren\u2019t you?\u201dThe Lackey knew about YuWon\u2019s relationship with Hephaestus.Adamantium was undoubtedly a great mineral, but not only was there an extremely limited supply of it, with how few blacksmiths there were capable of refining it, there was also low demand for it.Due to that, depending on whose hands it was in, its value fluctuated.\u201cSo why does that matter?\u201d\u201c> Well, since you\u2019re a player capable of getting it crafted into any item, wouldn\u2019t that naturally increase it\u2019s value?\u201dThe Lackey wasn\u2019t wrong. Any other player that came across adamantium would have to first face the hurdle of finding a blacksmith that could refine it. And even if they found someone capable, they\u2019d need to pay an exorbitant crafting cost.In that regard, YuWon was in an extremely advantageous position with Hephaestus being greatly indebted to him.YuWon had a slight snarl on his face. The conversation had gone on longer than he wanted in a direction he disliked.\u201cSo, what\u2019s the price?\u201d\u201c> Yes. It\u2019ll be 1.5 million points for 1.7kg of adamantium.\u201dIt was a ridiculous price. Even though it was adamantium, for less than 2kgs of it to cost 1.5 million points\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t have that much money.\u201d\u201c> I am able to provide a loan with an interest of 11.5%. Actually, since you are a reputable player, I can even give you a loan at a 10% interest rate.\u201dLackeys were businessmen at heart.YuWon let out a deep sigh.\u201cA loan you say\u2026\u201dThe Lackey nodded its head.\u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\u201c> Excellent choice! Then the 568,580 points you are short on will be borrowed through a loan at an interest rate of\u2014\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll just have to buy it elsewhere,\u201d YuWon said, closing the item shop window.It all happened in an instant. The Lackey went into shock, but that didn\u2019t last long. It once again put on a nice smile.\u201c> Hehe. If that\u2019s the case, I could discount it a little bit. I\u2019m not sure if you know, but this is a very rare item that can\u2019t be purchased elsewhere.\u201d\u201cEven without it, I\u2019ll have no difficulties climbing the Tower.\u201dYuWon\u2019s response put the Lackey into shock again for an entirely different reason.Players naturally desired better items to climb the Tower, but that didn\u2019t apply to YuWon. Not only did he already have sufficient skills to climb the Tower, he had been breaking one record after another on every floor\u2019s test.\u201cI have plenty of time. There are Lackeys on other floors, not to mention there are also auction houses. And if it comes down to it, I could also just buy a different item.\u201dIn short, YuWon was telling the Lackey that if it was going to propose such a price, he had no intention of doing business with it.\u201cLet\u2019s just end this here.\u201d\u201c> Uh\u2026 Wait,\u201d\u00a0the lackey said in a panic.YuWon was smiling on the inside. He was now in control of the flow of things.\u201cNah.\u201dIt was time to put the nails in the coffin.\u201cI\u2019m not buying.\u201d* * *\u201c> Then 900K\u2026 no, I\u2019ll sell it for 850K points.\u201d850,000 points. That was a fairly reasonable price, and it was the result of a long haggling session.\u2018That might even be cheaper than market price,\u2019 YuWon thought.YuWon nodded his head, \u201cIf that\u2019s the price\u2026\u201dThe Lackey who looked like it was on the brink of tears brightened up a little. But that was short lived. The Lackey carefully opened its mouth.\u201c> Um\u2026 Anyway, could you do\u2026 N-Nevermind. Let\u2019s just do 850K.\u201dDue to the limited number of people capable of crafting, paired with the price, there were very few actual purchases and sales of adamantium. So even though it was valuable, for a Lackey, holding onto it did nothing for it.In the end, 850K was still a lot of points, and it was unknown when another big baller like YuWon would come by. So it was essential for the Lackey to secure YuWon here.[You have spent 850,000 points.][You obtained 1.7kg of adamantium.]It was a pretty decent trade for YuWon.Truthfully, the sooner he obtained adamantium, the better it was for him. In fact, the Lackey was right to suggest a loan to purchase it if necessary because what YuWon needed wasn\u2019t just to climb the Tower without any troubles.\u2018Now I need to get this to Ahjussi\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought while looking at the \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d on the back of his invisible glove. \u2018However, I need this for the next test.\u2019The 11th Floor was Olympus\u2019s domain. That meant that Olympus had many options to manipulate the test as well as to lay traps for him.The \u300cPure Dark Divine Crystal\u300d was YuWon\u2019s greatest weapon. Not only could it release its own mana, it could change the attribute of mana with little effort.\u2018I\u2019ll have to go down as soon as I finish this test.\u2019Even for someone like Hephaestus, refining adamantium was no easy task, adding to the list of reasons why not too many people sought out this amazing mineral.One month at the very least to even over three months. That\u2019s how long it would take to produce the item. So taking that into account, it wouldn\u2019t be a wise choice for YuWon to sideline the Crystal on this floor.With a week left until the test, YuWon actually had a lot of time remaining.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201dAfter taking a moment to think, YuWon checked his status window before getting up.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I go on a walk?\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Hoon was one of the so-called geniuses. Not only was he a talented Pure-Blood player, being a direct descendent of the NamGung Clan, he had a background that supported his skills.Since the Tutorial, he had passed various tests before his peers. Having come from one of the top martial clans in the Martial Realm, as well as having a father that was an executive at the mid-sized Martial Guild, he\u2019d had no obstacles.Talent and skills. Support of a large faction. Natural-born leadership. Hard-working. With all those qualities, Hoon was definitely qualified to be the leader of his group.\u201cThis isn\u2019t as hard as I thought it\u2019d be.\u201d\u201cYeah. I was expecting more since I heard it was the hardest dungeon on the 11th Floor.\u201d\u201cIf this is all there is to it, we can definitely see it through to the end.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a given considering who we have.\u201dHis teammates, whose morale was at an all-time high, all turned their gazes to Hoon, who was wiping his sword with a towel.Hoon had long hair that was tied up in a traditional topknot. He was silently preparing to continue the raid of the dungeon, looking after a large sword that was the size of his own body.Clatter\u2014Hoon got up from his seat. Having rested plenty, he picked one of the splitting paths, saying \u201cHow about this way?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the direction you want to go.\u201d\u201cThings always go well for those who were meant to be something. If you want to go that way, I\u2019m with you.\u201d\u201cI agree as well.\u201dThe ten teammates were in unanimous consent.Being a maze-type dungeon, unless you had a high search-type skill, it was basically luck of the draw.\u201cSince we don\u2019t have a lot of time, let\u2019s hurry. We don\u2019t have many days left if we want to finish the dungeon raid and get some rest before the test.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u201cThe test, you say\u2026 Now that I think about it, it really is almost upon us.\u201dThe 11th Floor\u2019s test was the largest scale battle that players climbing the Tower would face, and tests that hundreds of players participated in together were also not very common.\u201cIs there any need to be so nervous? This test looks like it\u2019ll be a complete cake walk.\u201d\u201cYeah. Team A is just full of scrubs.\u201dDespite the scale of the battle, the team composition was so far in their favor it was practically impossible to feel nervous.The difference between the two teams was so large, some were even calling it the worst team draw in history.\u201cThere was one person that was noteworthy though.\u201d\u201cKim YuWon?\u201d\u201cHe is kind of a hotshot.\u201d\u201cTrue. He even passed the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really fucking unlucky, ending up on that team.\u201dRumor had already spread that\u00a0the\u00a0Kim YuWon was on Team A. People thought that this would end up being his first major setback after having smashed the records of every floor so far.\u201cStill, if he can even win this test, it\u2019ll really prove that he\u2019s great. In a way, it\u2019d be another record.\u201dBecause of that, people started to talk, speculating whether or not YuWon would simply give up this test.\u201cStop chatting and stay on your guard. We don\u2019t know when there might be an ambush,\u201d Hoon said, taking the lead and scolding his teammates. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give it our all in this test as well. That\u2019s all there is to it.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u201cAlright, I got it.\u201d\u201cI promise to keep that in mind, captain.\u201dReplying to Hoon, his teammates looked at how reliable their leader was.Agrea\u2019s Maze, said to be the hardest dungeon on the 11th Floor. Centered around Hoon, his team was raiding that very dungeon.\u2018We all have to level up one or two levels. And actually defeating Agrea should help the finances of the team quite a bit,\u2019 Hoon thought while tightly gripping his sword. \u2018Kim YuWon, huh\u2026\u2019Hoon had heard that name multiple times before. He was one of the players that were making names for themselves on the lower floors, just like him. In fact, it was well regarded that YuWon was far superior to him.He didn\u2019t know where YuWon was a Pure-Blood from, but he honestly wasn\u2019t all that curious. What he really wanted to know was if his skills were as great as rumored.\u2018I\u2019d like to be able to face him at least once in this test.\u2019While he was lost in thought, they arrived at the next room.Hoon prepared to use his skill, tensing up his legs. \u201cStop for a second,\u201d he ordered his team while slowly stepping forward. \u201cEveryone, prepare for combat\u2026\u201dDespite being ready for a fight, Hoon suddenly stopped in his tracks.His teammates that were following him asked in confusion, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cIs something there\u2026?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dHis teammates\u2019 reactions were no different than his.At the end of the tunnel, a large, circular room appeared. And inside that room, there was a purple blaze as well as dozens of spider monsters that were burnt to a crisp by the very same flames.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dozens, maybe even a hundred giant spiders even larger than the ones in the previous rooms lay dead.And that wasn\u2019t all.\u201cLook over there!\u201d one of the party members shouted, focusing the group\u2019s attention to where they were pointing.Their finger pointed up at the ceiling.Hoon\u2019s eyes widened after seeing what was up there.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cR-Really big\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s actually a spider?\u201dA spider the size of a house with dozens of legs was dead on the ceiling. It wasn\u2019t entirely clear because it had been burnt black, but it appeared to have had hundreds of eyes on its back.\u201cAgrea\u2026\u201dIt was obvious to anyone who wasn\u2019t an idiot. It was the boss of this dungeon. Agrea, the queen of spiders who hadn\u2019t been defeated for years now.\u201cIt died while stuck on the ceiling?\u201d\u201cWhat happened\u2026?\u201dDash\u2014While his companions were lost in confusion, Hoon jumped up. Running across the wall, he reached the ceiling, kicking Agrea\u2019s corpse and dropping it to the floor.Thud\u2014Because of how massive the corpse was, the chamber shook for a moment.Hoon closely inspected Agrea\u2019s corpse as the purple flames started to extinguish themselves.\u2018It wasn\u2019t only burnt by fire,\u2019 he thought.Inspecting the corpse would give him an approximate idea of the killer\u2019s skills. And coming from a martial clan specializing in the sword, Hoon was exceptional at reading traces of swordsmanship.\u2018These marks were definitely created by a sword. The sword\u2019s length is approximately 1.3 meters. They manage to slice through Agrea in a single swing after softening it with heat.\u2019Having checked the slash mark, Hoon was able to picture the fight in his head.The monstrously-large Agrea. A player that can control purple fire. And the player\u2019s movement, slicing Agrea in a single strike while it screamed in agony from being burnt alive.Shiver\u2014Hoon felt a chill up his spine. He wondered what might happen if he had to fight the player that did this.Looking around at his surroundings, he realized that there weren\u2019t any burn marks on the chamber itself.He had never heard of a skill that could do something like this.\u201cWas this maybe done by a Ranker?\u201d he said, thinking out loud.That was the only possible conclusion he could come to. The one who did this was simply too powerful for it to have been a player on just the 11th Floor.But that still beckoned the question, \u2018Why would a Ranker come all the way down here?\u2019There was no reason for a Ranker to raid a dungeon on the lower floors. It\u2019d be much better to raid the dungeons on the upper floors to level up. Not to mention a Ranker would get ridiculed by other Rankers if they were found to be raiding a dungeon on a lower floor.\u201c\u2026 We\u2019ll have to go back,\u201d Hoon said.The boss room that was found sooner than expected had already been cleared by someone else who got there before them through a different route.Hoon had no choice but to give up on this dungeon.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *[Agrea\u2019s Thread]\u15cc Classification : material\u15cc A thread from the Spider Queen Agrea. It has a high mana conductivity, and it is super elastic. It is also harder than steel.After checking what he reaped from the dungeon, YuWon put the lump of thread the size of his head into his inventory.\u201cI got lucky.\u201dHe ended up hitting an unexpected jackpot in the dungeon he entered on a whim to test out his skill.\u2018This much should fetch at least 1,000 points. Alternatively, I could also just keep it and use it later.\u2019He was already in a good mood when he stumbled upon this jackpot.After exiting the dungeon, YuWon called forth mana to his hand.Fwoosh\u2014A purple fire appeared above his palm.He couldn\u2019t feel any heat because [Holy Fire] was a skill that only damaged targets that YuWon designated.\u2018It\u2019s even greater than I expected.\u2019There were things that simply couldn\u2019t be explained by the text in a skill window.Having become a skill, the ability to wield the [Holy Fire] became engraved into his instincts. However, without actually using the skill, it was impossible to understand the full capabilities of how to use it.That\u2019s why YuWon wanted to test it out before the test.\u2018For being an S plus-ranked skill, the firepower isn\u2019t that great, but that\u2019s inevitable with a low proficiency\u2026 But that\u2019s not what\u2019s important.\u2019[Holy Fire] was a fire that grew bigger by eating the opponent\u2019s emotions, which was one of the scariest abilities that Outers possessed.Controlling one\u2019s emotions was difficult no matter how strong a mental fortitude one possessed. This applied to fear as well.Spiders were naturally afraid of fire, so as soon as YuWon manifested the [Holy Fire,] it quickly grew by feeding on the spiders\u2019 emotions. In that situation, [Holy Fire] had a greater effect than any fire-type skills he knew.\u2018Once I have a higher Arcane Power stat as well as a higher proficiency, the effect should increase manyfold.\u2019He had obtained quite a lot in this hunt, including raising the completion rate of [Heaven-Slaying Star,] which had stagnated during his long stay on the 10th Floor.[Completion rate: 91.67%]YuWon was now in the final stretch of completing [Heaven-Slaying Star.] It being an incomplete skill, YuWon was excited to see what kind of effect it would have once it was completed.\u2018This is going faster than I expected.\u2019His current growth speed was much faster than originally planned, but as the path ahead was thorny and treacherous, he couldn\u2019t be satisfied with his current progress.\u201cHuh?\u201dAfter returning to the inn, YuWon found a group of players gathered around, loitering in front of his room. They all had worried looks on their faces.\u201cWhat are you guys doing in front of someone else\u2019s room?\u201d YuWon asked.Step, step\u2014As he walked down the hallway, they focused their gazes on YuWon.There were a total of eight players, none of which YuWon had met before.\u201cAre you\u2026 YuWon, by chance?\u201d one of them asked.As expected, their business was with YuWon.The fact that YuWon had arrived on the 11th Floor and was going to participate in the test was already well known. That was unavoidable since the team list for the next test had already been publicly announced.After taking a second to think on how he should respond, YuWon nodded his head. \u201cSo?\u201d he said, thinking that it was pointless to lie.\u201cWe are fellow members of Team A, like you. My name is Halimun.\u201dYuWon nodded his head, signaling them to go on.Halimun, glad to know that YuWon intended to hear them out, carried on. \u201cAs you know, the teams are highly disproportionate in this test. Team B has many well-known players, such as NamGung Hoon.\u201dYuWon already knew all this, but he simply didn\u2019t care. However, the same couldn\u2019t be said of everyone other than YuWon.\u201cAbout half the players on Team A have already forfeited, but there are still half remaining,\u201d Halimum said.\u201cAnd is that because of me?\u201d YuWon asked.YuWon\u2019s perceptiveness made Halimun nod his head in surprise.\u201cYes. There are many skilled players on Team B, but I\u2019m sure none of them are on your level. The remaining half believe that because you are on the team\u2014\u201d\u201cAnd that has nothing to do with the fact that you guys are out of points?\u201d YuWon interrupted Halimun.Maybe it was because YuWon hit the nail on the head, but Halimun and the others looked away.On every floor, every time you took the test, players had to pay a test fee. The test fee was as low as 100 points and as high as 1,000 points. For YuWon this was chump change, but that wasn\u2019t the case for your average lower-floor players.On top of that, if you failed a test and wanted to try again, you had to pay the test fee again. This meant that quite a significant number of players gave up on climbing the Tower, being unable to pay the seemingly exorbitant test fees.\u201cSince it\u2019d be a waste of points to just give up, you want to make an attempt by rallying around someone reliable. Is that it? YuWon asked.\u201cThat\u2019s a rude accusation\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe just wanted to discuss how we could pass the test together\u2026\u201d\u201cI have something to say about that,\u201d YuWon said while walking past the players to his room. \u201cIf you value your lives, just give up. There\u2019s nothing that amazing up there that\u2019s worth potentially dying a meaningless death.\u201dYuWon already knew well what lay at the top of the Tower, as well as the power that Rankers ended up attaining.Most people that climbed the Tower revered the power of Rankers, wishing for a taste of that very same power and the influence that came with it.\u2018It\u2019s all meaningless,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.9 out of 10, or more like 99 out of 100 people would lose their lives in the process.And this test was even more dangerous than usual.\u2018I should be the only one to enter this tiger\u2019s den.\u2019This test was rigged, aimed at YuWon, and the other members of Team A were simply the sacrificial lambs.Thinking that there was no need for them to be moths flying into the flames, he wished that they would give up on this test.\u201cNow if you have nothing else to say, go away. It\u2019s not a pretty sight, being gathered around a stranger\u2019s room,\u201d YuWon said while opening his door. He had nothing more to say to them.Halimun, who had been gritting his teeth from the humiliation, opened his mouth while trembling, \u201cSo you\u2019re also just going to give up?\u201dHalf the team had already forfeited the test. If YuWon also gave up, the remaining 1% chance would vanish.\u201cNo,\u201d Yuwon replied, contrary to Halimun\u2019s expectations. \u201cI\u2019m going to challenge the test.\u201d\u201cHuh? But you just told us to give up, and that\u2026\u201dYuWon glanced back at Halimun and other players while closing the door, leaving them with a final line, \u201cThat only applies to you guys.\u201dThunk\u2014The door closed.They didn\u2019t go away right away, so YuWon could hear whispering outside his door. If he tried hard, he would be able to make out what they were saying, but he didn\u2019t bother.\u2018I wonder how many of them will give up,\u2019 he thought.There weren\u2019t many that valued their life so little that they would be willing to challenge the test even while knowing Yuwon wasn\u2019t going to cooperate with them. So for anyone that remained, it meant that they were that desperate, and so they\u2019d be at least somewhat useful.\u2018I\u2019m colliding with them sooner than planned\u2026 but this is actually good.\u2019He couldn\u2019t avoid the challenge even while knowing it was a trap. Regardless of this test, Olympus was sure to continue coming after YuWon.From the moment he got in the way of them capturing Hephaestus, they ended up in an irreparable relationship.\u2018The larger the trap, the more likely it is to get noticed by the Administrator. I know Olympus is going to try their hardest to eliminate me while I\u2019m still on the lower floors.\u2019Having deeply interfered with the test, Olympus was now also exposed to danger. That was why YuWon decided to jump in headfirst even while knowing it was a trap.\u201cBring it on, Olympus.\u201dThis wasn\u2019t just a test to move on to the next floor. It was why YuWon spent days honing his senses, which had become dull from returning to the past, to their maximum.And thus, time flew, and the day of the test dawned.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Chapter 67The day of the test dawned.The location was the Dark Forest of Elilaum.Hypnos, the test examiner, once again looked through the list of the participating players. First Team A then Team B.Quite a few familiar names were visible.\u201cI\u2019m going to be chewed out for a while.\u201dThere was too great of a difference in skills between the two teams.Hoon alone was known as a super rookie capable of potentially becoming a High Ranker one day. The genius of the NamGung Clan. A player that NamGung JinWoon, a distinguished Ranker and the head of the NamGung clan, said will one day surpass him.\u201cBut the cream of the crop is this guy.\u201dThere were a lot of people paying attention to this test. Part of that was because there were quite a few skilled players on Team B, but the main reason was due to a single player on Team A.\u201cKim YuWon,\u201d Hypnos said to himself.It was the only name that stood out on the Team A roster, almost creating an illusion where the letters of his name sparkled like gold.It made the names of the players on Team B look pathetic in comparison. His name was famous, not only among the players of the lower floors, but even among Rankers.\u201cHow did someone with such a bright future end up with a target on his back? Tsk, tsk.\u201dHypnos pushed his hair back.From the top of the Tower, there was one single order given out by the great Olympus.Exterminate the player Kim YuWon.Within the space of this test, it would become possible to try and do something to YuWon, and on the 11th Floor, where Hypnos was the test examiner, YuWon was basically in the palm of Olympus\u2019s hand.Hypnos was flying around on a white bull. Beneath him was a sea of dense forestry. It was Elilaum, the stage of this test.\u201cThe preparations should almost be finished.\u201dHypnos let out a long sigh, laying his head on the bull\u2019s back.If this test went well, not only would he be given a few days of vacation, he would also be rewarded well by Olympus. Just the thought of that was enough to make Hypnos smile.That was when\u2026Ding!Hypnos\u2019s player kit rang.It was a message.\u201cWho\u2019s sending me a message right before the test\u2026\u201dThe annoyance from having his sweet daydream interrupted didn\u2019t last long. After seeing who the message was from, he reflixibly sat up in a proper position.[Hera]One of the eight High Rankers that symbolized Olympus and the wife of Zeus, king of Olympus.* * *Teams A and B had gathered.There was a sharp contrast in the number of players the two teams had.Hypnos counted all the players that had arrived on time. \u201cTeam A, 51 people. Team B, 200 people\u2026\u201dOne side had almost four times as many people as the other. On top of that, there was an even greater difference in the quality of the players.\u201cMore players came than I expected,\u201d Hypnos said, seeing all the players that came for Team A.It wouldn\u2019t have been odd if the entirety of Team A had forfeited, so 51 people was many times more people than what Hypnos had expected.\u2018To think he\u2019d actually participate\u2026\u2019 Hypnos thought while looking at the reason this many people even showed up. \u2018Does he not know that this is a trap?\u2019Kim YuWon\u2019s presence was what made this possible. The player that passed the Tutorial above Hargaan, an Olympian Pure-Blood. The player that set a new record on every floor, even passing the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.Despite all those achievements, Hypnos thought that he was too overconfident.\u2018There\u2019s no way he thinks he can overcome this much of a difference by himself\u2026\u2019A single hand couldn\u2019t beat ten hands. Well, that might have been the case in other worlds, but in the world of the Tower, that was false.One hand could beat ten hands. Dominating, overwhelming power could beat the power of numbers. But that only applied to Rankers.Currently, YuWon didn\u2019t have to beat ten hands but hundreds. And a few of those hands were more powerful than the average hand.\u2018Does he think he might be able to do something because this is a test?\u2019This fight was no simple fight. Because it was a test to discern if one had the qualifications to move on to the next floor, there were \u2018rules\u2019 to this test. It wasn\u2019t some fight where just pure difference in power mattered.There was a high, no, a 100% chance that the players of Team A were counting on the \u2018rules.\u2019\u201cAhem,\u201d Hypnos lightly coughed while observing the players. \u201cHello, everyone. My name is Hypnos. I\u2019m the test examiner of the 11th Floor.\u201dHypnos\u2019s gaze went from YuWon to Hoon, Ro\u2019el, Spyros, and others.The various Rankers observing this test were either sponsors of these players or members of guilds that wanted to recruit them.Hypnos was more tense than he had been for any other test he had been an examiner for.\u201cTeam A looks short of a lot of people\u2026 But there will be no changes made, and we will go forward with these teams as is,\u201d Hypnos announced.The players on Team A who held but a sliver of hope all let out a sigh. If the teams were resorted, their chances could have gone up.\u201cI\u2019ll get straight to the point by explaining the contents of the test and starting immediately. This will be your test,\u201d Hypnos said, raising a red flag for everyone to see. \u201cCapture the flag.\u201dWhen the test was revealed, everyone murmured.Capture the Flag.It was something entirely new to the people who were taking the large team test for the first time. But a few smart ones were able to discern what the test would be about from the name.For YuWon, this was a familiar test.\u2018This is going to be annoying.\u2019YuWon wondered why it had to be capture the flag. This was a test that he couldn\u2019t solo.Hypnos continued to explain, \u201cThe test is simple, but I should first explain that the flags have been crafted through technomancy and are capable of doing the following.\u201dHypnos pulled out another flag and brought them together, which made one of them disappear into thin air, and on the remaining flag was now the number 2.\u201cThis number represents the number of flags. I\u2019m sure you won\u2019t forget this unless you\u2019re a complete imbecile. Now, the challenge is where the flags are,\u201d Hypnos spoke while looking to the massive forest behind him. \u201cThe flags are laid out across the forest. In the middle of the road, at the bottom of a cliff, at the top of a tree, and even on the body of a monster. You have no idea how much of a struggle it was to set them up.\u201dHypnos\u2019s explanation made a few players chuckle. They could visualize how much hard work it must have been to lay out flags across such a big forest.Hypnos continued, \u201cYou guys just have to collect the flags that are spread out throughout the forest. The team that collects the highest number of flags at the end wins. Simple, right?\u201dFrom the explanation, it really did seem simple. However, this wasn\u2019t such an easy test.\u201cBut this test is called \u2018capture the flag\u2019 not \u2018collect the flag.\u2019 This isn\u2019t a children\u2019s game like tag or something like that,\u201d Hypnos said while smirking. \u201cYou will be able to take the flags that your opponents have collected. The method does not matter. You can steal, threaten, kill, or do whatever you like in order to take them.\u201dThat was the true essence of the test. It didn\u2019t matter if you couldn\u2019t find a single flag. If you could take your opponent\u2019s flags, you could win in the end.\u201cFinally, this test has \u2018kings.\u2019\u201dYuWon\u2019s brows furrowed. This was the reason that this test would be complicated.Hypnos reassured the players, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s not like chess. You won\u2019t fail just because your king dies. However, the role of the king is critical because any flags that the king holds is counted as double.\u201dThe eyes of the players of Team A all lit up.Double.For a team with significantly less members, their only option was to utilize the \u2018king\u2019 to their full potential.Naturally, all their gazes looked towards Yuwon. And YuWon understood immediately what their gazes meant.\u2018I wish for that to be the case too,\u2019 YuWon thought.If YuWon could be the \u2018king\u2019 and he caught the enemy \u2018king,\u2019 it wasn\u2019t impossible for them to win this test. However\u2026\u201cThe \u2018king\u2019 is decided randomly. You all know how it is. This is a shitty luck-based test.\u201d Hypnos said while laughing.YuWon felt an urge to punch Hypnos in his smug face.Random? Luck?On paper, YuWon should have had a 1 in 51 chance of becoming the \u2018king,\u2019 but the actual probability was 0.\u201cOkay. Now then\u2026\u201dVwooom\u2014A blue magic array appeared underneath the two teams.\u201cThe test will begin,\u201d Hypnos announced.Flash\u2014!* * *Flash\u2014!The magic array lit up and the view changed.YuWon looked around at his surroundings, which was somewhere inside the forest.\u2018So we\u2019ve all been transported,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.All the players of Team A were transported to the same location.Somewhere in this forest were flags for them to search and find.[The 11th Floor test will now begin.][Please find the flags spread out across the forest.][The team with more flags after 24 hours will win.][The flags can be stolen.][Your CP (Contribution Points) will be based on the number of flags you obtain.][If you deliver a flag to a \u2018king,\u2019 you will receive double the CP.][If the \u2018king\u2019 has his flags stolen, your CP will disappear.][Your reward will be based on your CP.][Team A: 0 flags][Team B: 0 flags]Hypnos had just given a detailed explanation of the test, and this was a test that YuWon had already experienced before.The victory in capture the flag was dictated by how you utilized your \u2018king\u2019 and whether or not you were able to get the other team\u2019s \u2018king.\u2019So priority one was figuring out who the \u2018king\u2019 was, which wasn\u2019t hard at all.\u201cHuh?\u201cWhat\u2019s up with you, man? What\u2019s going on with your body?\u201dYuWon looked over at the commotion.There was a guy by himself shining in the shady forest.It was Halimun.\u201cIt says\u2026 I\u2019m the \u2018king,\u2019\u201d Halimun said in a daze, not having expected himself to become the \u2018king.\u2019YuWon let out a deep sigh. That reaction alone was enough to disqualify him in YuWon\u2019s mind.\u201cWhat do I do?\u201d Halimun asked.They were already in a disadvantageous situation, and the \u2018king\u2019 that was supposed to be the crux of this test was in a state of total confusion.\u2018It honestly makes me wonder how he even got this far,\u2019 YuWon thought disapprovingly.Step\u2014The first one to break away from the group was YuWon.All the players on Team A had been closely watching YuWon and Halimun.Seeing YuWon walk into the distance, Halimun asked, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to go grab the flags, so don\u2019t go off and get killed somewhere and just stay here.\u201dHalimun followed up YuWon\u2019s response with, \u201cY-You\u2019re not going to protect the \u2018king\u2019?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not how you\u2019re supposed to beg for your life. Don\u2019t worry. There won\u2019t be any fighting right away,\u201d YuWon replied.After saying that to Halimun, who had fallen into the role of the \u2018king,\u2019 YuWon looked over at the other players, advising them, \u201cDon\u2019t just fool around. If you guys want to climb up, you need to obtain even the littlest bit of CP and secure a reward.\u201dThe players on Team A nodded their heads at YuWon\u2019s words.He was right. Since they had just started, neither side had any flags yet. There wouldn\u2019t be any clashes right away, meaning the priority was securing the flags that were spread across the forest.\u2018At least it looks like they got the gist of it,\u2019 YuWon thought.Seeing the players move one by one, he himself started to get moving again.Step, step\u2014The forest was quiet, but the 11th Floor\u2019s forest was essentially a large dungeon with monsters creeping around every corner.\u2018He said that there were flags on the road, at the top of trees, etc\u2026 but most are probably held by monsters.\u2019That was only natural for a test where you had to obtain flags.\u2018Well then\u2026\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes turned red, and immediately the claustrophobic forest felt like a wide-open plain to him. He could easily see a monster passing by far beyond the trees.It was an ogre, also called the \u2018king of the forest.\u2019 And on his clothes hung a flag.As expected, there was a higher chance that the stronger monsters would have flags on them.\u2018I guess it\u2019s time for me to start running.\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68\u201cWell, this is going to be a complete walk in the park.\u201dUnlike Team A, there was not a shred of tension among team B.They were just slightly amused by who the \u2018king\u2019 was. There was no talk on how to utilize the \u2018king.\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s just way too big a difference.\u201d\u201cHave any of you guys heard of a guy named Vance on the other team? I took a test with him before, and, man, he\u2019s a complete joke.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have many skills, and his level is low, too. But most importantly, he\u2019s completely incompetent. It\u2019s honestly a shock he even got this far.\u201d\u201cDo you think that Team A is full of guys like that?\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d\u201cOther than Kim YuWon, I haven\u2019t heard of any of them. Besides, there\u2019s such a massive gap in numbers.\u201dThe mood was completely relaxed.Hoon looked around at his companions who had come with him, observing the same thing.\u201cBeing too nervous isn\u2019t good,\u201d a deep voice ripped throughout Team B, \u201cbut being too lax is even worse.\u201dHoon\u2019s words made his companions tense up a little.It was something he had told them multiple times. Every test, Hoon insisted on a moderate level of tension.The best condition was moderate tension. The second best was extreme tension. And the worst condition was carelessness. That was how Hoon was taught.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThis is a test\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd the enemy team does have YuWon.\u201dThe only opponent they had to be cautious of in this test was YuWon. That meant the only variables for them were YuWon and the existence of the \u2018king.\u2019\u201cHe\u2019s right. Let\u2019s be a little more alert. We can have fun after the test is over.\u201d\u201cYeah. We can go out together or something.\u201d\u201cAll of us?\u201d\u201cSounds good to me.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s hurry up.\u201dThe players on Team B started skedaddling.Hoon\u2019s brows furrowed watching them. \u2018They didn\u2019t understand a word,\u2019 he thought.It was 51 versus 200. With such a dominant difference in numbers, it couldn\u2019t be helped that they weren\u2019t nervous. This applied to Hoon as well.But this went beyond not being nervous. They were being outright careless, talking as if victory was guaranteed and thinking of the after party. It was like his words went in one ear and right out the other.\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d said a voice from behind Hoon, making him turn his head.It was a woman with stunning blonde hair that reached her waistline. Her radiant beauty paired with pure-white clothes was enough for her to grab everyone\u2019s attention around her.Hoon wasn\u2019t all that interested in others, but he knew her name.\u201cYour name is Ro\u2019el, right?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored that you know my name.\u201dShe was called the Angel Ro\u2019el. The nickname \u2018Angel\u2019 came from both her beauty and her ability.A gentle breeze blew around her.Hoon felt his body becoming lighter. He narrowed his eyes, realizing that it was the result of Ro\u2019el\u2019s ability.\u2018Healing and buffing. They\u2019re uncommon abilities,\u2019 he thought.There weren\u2019t many support players. Not only was it hard for them to fight alone, but they were also the most susceptible to danger. Paired with the fact that it was hard to obtain buffing skills, it severely limited the number of support players.Ro\u2019el was a rising star among the few support players. Thanks to that, despite being only on the 11th Floor, she was as highly valued as players on the top floors.\u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. It\u2019s an undeniable fact that there is a massive difference in power,\u201d she told Hoon.\u201cThat is an undeniable fact. Or that\u2019s how it looks on the surface. \u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Ro\u2019el asked.Hoon replied while looking around at the players that were spreading out, \u201cDon\u2019t you think it\u2019s odd? For being randomly placed, there\u2019s too large a difference between the teams.\u201d\u201cIs this not just a coincidence?\u201d\u201cIn the world I\u2019m from, there is a saying. \u2018There\u2019s no such thing as coincidence in the world of the strong.\u2019\u201dWhen something looked like a coincidence, there was likely a hidden reason for what was going on. Hoon felt that something was off with this test. And the same went for Ro\u2019el.She wasn\u2019t an idiot. It was only natural to think that something was weird when such a large difference in teams happened, but that was the extent of her thoughts.\u201cBut we\u2019re still on Team B. Does the reason really matter?\u201d she told Hoon.\u201c\u2026 I guess,\u201d Hoon replied, but on his face was a look of doubt. Did the reason really not matter?It might have been like Ro\u2019el said, where the reason didn\u2019t matter as long as it benefited them, but the whole situation was still greatly off-putting for Hoon. It was an instinctive feeling, and rarely were his instincts wrong.\u201cBy the way, who is our team\u2019s \u2018king\u2019? Does anyone know?\u201d Ro\u2019el asked.Hoon\u2019s companions shook their heads in response. The same went for Ro\u2019el\u2019s companions. And there was no need to bother asking Hoon, who barely remembered Ro\u2019el\u2019s name.\u201cIt must be a not very well-known player, seeing as how no one knows,\u201d Ro\u2019el spoke nonchalantly. She didn\u2019t really care who the \u2018king\u2019 was, and that was inevitable because even if something potentially happened to the \u2018king,\u2019 it seemed like an unloseable game for them.Meanwhile, Team A was in a position where they had to protect the \u2018king.\u2019Hoon thought, \u2018I guess it\u2019s inevitable that she doesn\u2019t care.\u2019Their obvious dominance was likely the reason why no one paid interest to the \u2018king.\u2019\u2018But\u2026\u2019 Hoon wondered about the face of the \u2018king\u2019 that flashed gold in color. \u2018What did that guy look like?\u2019It was the strangest thing. Due to his great memory, since he was a kid, he never forgot something he saw once, yet he couldn\u2019t remember the face of the \u2018king\u2019 on his own team.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *Halimun didn\u2019t move around by himself. Rather, to be exact, he couldn\u2019t. He was accompanied by many people on top of his regular companions.The reason was simple. It was the golden light that shone out from Halimun\u2019s body because he was Team A\u2019s \u2018king.\u2019\u201cFound it!\u201d\u201cNice. So it was in a place like that.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it in somewhat of a dangerous spot?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go grab it.\u201dAt the bottom of a cliff, a red flag could be seen. It was the fourth flag they had found.A member of Team A scaled down the cliff to fetch the flag.\u201cThere are way too few flags spread out around the path. The other three flags were all held by monsters\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s probably where most of the flags are. If they were all in the middle of the road, this would just be a luck-based test.\u201d\u201cTrue.\u201d\u201cBut we still got a good number.\u201dThey were collecting the flags while escorting the \u2018king.\u2019 As important as protecting the \u2018king\u2019 was, if they couldn\u2019t collect any flags, it would be entirely meaningless.\u201cAnd that\u2019s now another flag for the \u2018king\u2019\u2026\u201dHalimun took the flag from his teammate, and the number of his flag changed from 6 to 8.\u201cWhen you give the flag to the \u2018king,\u2019 you get an extra flag. Plus the \u2018king\u2019 and the person who grabbed the flag get additional CP. This is a sweet deal.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a huge boost.\u201d\u201cIt really might be doable as long as we can get the enemy team\u2019s \u2018king.\u2019\u201dThey had gained a sliver of hope in a test that originally seemed doomed. It was thanks to the number of flags the two teams held.[Team A: 59 flags][Team B: 110 flags]The difference was almost double, but that didn\u2019t necessarily mean despair.\u2018We can overcome this difference if we can just get their \u2018king,\u2019\u2019 Halimun thought.The difference was just slightly shy of double, and Team A had yet to gather all their flags to the king.It was likely that Team B also didn\u2019t give all their flags to their \u2018king\u2019 yet, but whether or not that was the case, it didn\u2019t change the fact that they could still make up the difference by getting the enemy \u2018king.\u2019\u2018And the only one who can do that\u2026\u2019 Halimun thought while tightening his grip on his flag, \u2018is him.\u2019Kim YuWon. It was highly likely that a good number of the 59 flags were found by YuWon.\u201cBut this place is really big. Navigating around is also no joke\u2026\u201d\u201cI wonder where Team B\u2019s starting point is.\u201d\u201cSince we agreed to meet up at midnight and pool our flags together, we should hurry up.\u201d\u201cSince we\u2019re a party of ten, we need to try harder.\u201d\u201cWe have to find at least ten\u2026\u201dSnap\u2014It was the sound of a branch snapping, and it wasn\u2019t caused by any of the party members present.Halimun and the other players turned their heads towards the source of the sound.\u201cWho goes there?\u201dThe area became silent, and no presence could be felt, but that didn\u2019t last long.Suddenly, the surrounding area grew noisier, and they could feel the presence of multiple people.\u201cCome on.\u201d\u201cThey found out.\u201d\u201cWho was it that stepped on the branch?\u201d\u201cI told you guys to watch your feet.\u201dRustle, rustle\u2014A group of people walked out from the foliage.And with that\u2026[Players from the enemy team have appeared.][Defend your flags.]A message popped up for players of Team A.They were players from Team B.To each side, players of the opposing team had a faint red glow to them. This was likely a similar principle to how the \u2018king\u2019 shone gold.\u201cIt\u2019s just that I\u2019m worried about YuWon on Team A.\u201d\u201cEven YuWon won\u2019t be able to do jack shit if he doesn\u2019t have a \u2018king.\u2019\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s like taking candy from a crying baby.\u201d\u201cNot to mention the CP you can get from getting the enemy \u2018king\u2019\u2026\u201dA few players on Team B did become more alert after hearing Hoon\u2019s warning earlier. They were players that were intimidated by YuWon\u2019s name. However, they also knew that there was no reason why they would have to directly face YuWon.Their objective wasn\u2019t YuWon, but the \u2018king.\u2019Due to the rules of the test, as long as they got Team A\u2019s \u2018king,\u2019 victory was as good as theirs, not to mention the flags and CP they\u2019d gain from taking down the \u2018king.\u2019\u201cW-Why are there so many people here?\u201d\u201cTwelve\u2026 No, thirteen?\u201d\u201cNo. There\u2019s even more than that.\u201d\u201cDamn it. Don\u2019t be a wimp. We have ten people on our side!\u201d someone from Team A shouted, but it was no use.\u201cTen?\u201d someone from Team B said, smirking. It was a player wearing a black mask, wielding a dagger. \u201cI think you mean nine.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026 do you\u2026\u201d A faint red line appeared across the neck of the player that was trying to ask what he meant. Then soon after, his head fell to the ground.It was an assasination.\u201cF-Fuck!\u201d\u201cAtroc!\u201d\u201cW-We give up!\u201dUnfortunately, you couldn\u2019t give up in this test.The players on Team A fell into a panic.

It was the assassin that first killed his teammate.He could feel the cold blade coming closer to his neck, so he closed his eyes, anticipating death.\u2018This is it for me\u2026\u2019 Halimun thought.\u201cAnd with this, it\u2019s our\u2026\u201d the assassin\u2019s voice trailed off.Halimun\u2019s head remained in one piece.Confused, he opened his eyes and heard a familiar voice.\u201cI told you to stay still.\u201dIt was the voice he wanted to hear more than anything.\u201cWhy do people never listen to me?\u201dSplatter\u2014Blood splashed on Halimun\u2019s back.YuWon had arrived.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Did you forget who we\u2019re up against?\u201d\u201cA High Pure-Blood would already be hard for us to handle, and this guy is even more of a monster than them.\u201d\u201cWe should back off.\u201dYuWon\u2019s appearance put a damper on the chaos.Within the crowd of whispering players, Yuwon noticed a red flag.\u201cYou guys can go, but leave that behind,\u201d YuWon said, pointing at the flag with the tip of his sword. \u201cBecause you guys aren\u2019t retreating, instead I\u2019m letting you guys go.\u201dThe dozen or so players on Team B all had sour looks on their faces.YuWon wanted them to leave their flags behind. It had only been a few hours since the test started, but they had been running around hard to obtain these flags.Also, their chance of losing would become higher if they handed over their flags because YuWon\u2019s \u2018king\u2019 was present.\u201cHere,\u201d one of Team B\u2019s players said, pulling out a flag from his coat. The flag said 2. The player continued, \u201cIt\u2019s only two, but that\u2019s more than what most of these guys have. I\u2019ll leave this behind, so let me go.\u201dYuWon nodded his head as he walked towards Team B.The players split, creating a path for YuWon, and in an instant, he was now in the middle of over a dozen enemy players.[You obtained 2 flags.][You obtained 20cp.]A CP notification popped up with his procurement of the flag.Two flags. It wasn\u2019t a bad gain.The player that had put his flag down started leaving, and YuWon let him go. He then looked at the other players, asking them, \u201cNow what will you guys do?\u201dYuWon waited for their decision. There was no need to spill any unnecessary blood, especially when killing the enemy team awarded 0cp.As long as they just peacefully handed over their flags, Yuwon was just going to let them go.However\u2026\u201cAre you fucking kidding me?!\u201d\u201cWe were just going to back off, but you had to provoke us.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go at it\u2026\u201dA player from Team B took a step towards YuWon, and\u2026Slash\u2014The sound of slicing through bone echoed through the forest.Splatter\u2014!The player that had shown killing intent while walking towards YuWon ended up getting his body sliced in half.None of the blood got on YuWon, however, as he repelled all the red drops aimed at him with his sword.\u201cThat\u2019s one down.\u201dPlop\u2014A flag fell to the ground.YuWon picked up the flag.The guys that seemed like they were about to explode suddenly fell silent.The situation had changed.\u201cSo, what will you guys do?\u201d YuWon asked again.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe players of Team B tried to gauge the situation, trying to decide what to do.If they gave up their flags, they\u2019d be able to leave with their lives intact. On the other hand, if they fought, their lives couldn\u2019t be guaranteed, but there was a chance they could defeat YuWon and Team A\u2019s \u2018king.\u2019They might even be able to gain the reputation of defeating YuWon.\u2018If I could do that\u2026\u2019\u2018I might be contacted by a major guild.\u2019These were the thoughts running through many of their heads. That they\u2019d be able to join a major guild if they were victorious against Kim YuWon.It was a well-known rumor that multiple major guilds were interested in YuWon, so it was natural that if they were able to take down YuWon, they would end up gaining the interest of the major guilds.In the Tower, major guilds were basically kingdoms. And becoming members of said kingdoms could net them a significant amount of power. But\u2026\u201cI-I\u2019ll give up.\u201d\u201cMe too\u2026\u201d\u201cS-Same. H-Here\u2019s my flag!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have any flags. Please believe me!\u201d\u2026 They still gave up on fighting.It was only a natural decision. None of the players present valued their lives so little that they were willing to challenge him after YuWon had just displayed his skills.This also meant that no one present was that skilled.\u201cWell then\u2026\u201d YuWon said, collecting the flags, \u201chand over everything you guys have.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *[You obtained a flag.][You obtained 10cp.][You obtained a flag.][You obtained\u2026]YuWon smiled wide. From a party of over a dozen players, he managed to take eight flags.\u2018They had quite a few on them,\u2019 YuWon thought.Because it hadn\u2019t been that long since the test had begun, there were quite a few players who didn\u2019t have a flag yet. So it was a big haul that more than half the players present had a flag on them.After obtaining the eight flags, YuWon decided he had to change gears.\u201cThe first half of the game is over,\u201d YuWon said.It had been about four hours since the test started. That was enough time for quite a few flags to have been found. From here on out, it was more efficient to hunt players on the enemy team rather than hunt monsters.YuWon continued, \u201cTeam B\u2019s going to start coming after our flags. And like these guys, some of them are going to start aiming for the \u2018king.\u2019\u201d\u201cM-Me?\u201d Halimun asked stutteringly. He still couldn\u2019t stop shaking from the fear.\u201cIs there another \u2018king\u2019 here?\u201d\u201cTh-That\u2019s true, but\u2026\u201d\u201cSo from here on out, do not be more than 20m away from me. Even I will have a hard time winning this test without the \u2018king.\u2019\u201dTo YuWon, Halimun was an annoyance but also necessary because he needed the \u2018king\u2019 to win.Not only was his team outnumbered four to one, there were no reliable players on Team A. So the only way YuWon could carry this game was to maximize the usage of the \u2018king.\u2019\u2018And I need the \u2018king\u2019 to get double the CP\u2026 So as annoying as it is, it\u2019s better if I keep this guy by my side.\u2019YuWon thought it would be much easier if he could be the \u2018king,\u2019 but if that were the case, he wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain as much CP. It was a high-risk, high-reward situation.In the end, this was a test YuWon had to hustle by himself.\u201cWhere are the other teammates?\u201d\u201cEveryone spread out. We decided that the best starting move was to gather as many flags as possible\u2026\u201d\u201cThat was a smart decision,\u201d YuWon mumbled while looking at the number on his flag. \u201cThat is as long as you guys don\u2019t end up having it stolen.\u201dHalimun\u2019s gaze turned to YuWon\u2019s flag. Upon checking the number of flags he had collected, Halimun\u2019s eyes widened.\u201827 flags?!\u2019That was an unbelievable amount for someone to have collected alone.He did just obtain eight, but that meant that even before they met up, he already had nineteen flags.One flag was already difficult to obtain. Halimun wondered how it was possible for YuWon to obtain nineteen in such a short time.Halimun checked his team\u2019s flags.[Team A: 64 flags]Among the 64 flags, 27 were in YuWon\u2019s possession. That was almost half, and with the skills he just exhibited, soon enough, he would have over half.\u2018Is he really planning on carrying this test by himself?\u2019 Halimun wondered.From the beginning, YuWon wasn\u2019t treating this as a team-based test.And for Team B, this was a test where 200 people had to cooperate to defeat the monster that was YuWon.\u2018But the number of flags doesn\u2019t add up\u2026\u2019 Halimun was confused.When he had checked earlier, the number of flags on Team A were 59. So with the eight flags YuWon just took, their total should have been 67.[Team B: 105 flags]Team B\u2019s total flags decreased, but it wasn\u2019t by eight.This meant that\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s finally started,\u201d YuWon said after he, too, checked the number of flags. \u201cThe \u2018capture\u2019 portion of the test.\u201dThe ball finally started rolling in this game.* * *\u201c\u2026 So you escaped after just leaving your flags behind?\u201d Hoon asked.His question made the rest of Team B look over at the players that ran away after losing their flags.Their gazes were full of discontent, wondering why they didn\u2019t bother fighting when they outnumbered him.\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t see his skills! Kayle and Max were taken down in a single strike!\u201d\u201cYou couldn\u2019t even see his sword because of how fast it was. It sent a shiver down my spine\u2026\u201d\u201cI could see it, but it was still really fast.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re bullshitting again. How did it move?\u201d\u201cHuh? Well\u2026 It was like this, and\u2026\u201d\u201cStop bullshitting.\u201dUnembarrassed, they continued their explanation.Hoon simply shook his head, disappointed in them.These were pretty skilled players of the 11th Floor. Only a few of them were truly exceptional, but they were still all above average.And the guy named Kayle was someone that even Hoon had heard of before.\u2018So Kim YuWon is that skilled,\u2019 Hoon thought to himself.The players of Team B started looking serious.A group of over ten players had lost to him. Only two players had died, but this wasn\u2019t a problem they could just ignore.They had lost their flags, and in the end, this was a test to see which side could collect more flags.\u201cSo even if we\u2019re all in groups of ten, he can take us down group by group,\u201d Hoon mumbled.The players on Team B agreed with him. If YuWon took them down group by group and took their flags, in the end, they\u2019d be at a disadvantage.\u201cThen what should we do?\u201d someone asked.This question put Hoon into deep thought. He originally anticipated this to be an easy game, but YuWon ended up being a bigger variable than expected.\u201c\u2026 Did you say that YuWon and the \u2018king\u2019 got together?\u201d The first one to break the silence was Ro\u2019el. She looked like she had just thought of something.\u201cUh, yeah. I think he was on his way back from gathering flags.\u201d\u201cThat leaves us with only one option,\u201d Ro\u2019el decided. \u201cPlease contact Salamov, Kaichel, and any other skilled players on our team.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cA-Are you serious?\u201dRo\u2019el\u2019s order shocked everyone because they knew what Ro\u2019el meant.She nodded her head and said, \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of time left. We can\u2019t just keep running away.\u201dHer words made everyone murmur.She was right. The first half of the test was now ending. They couldn\u2019t win this test by just handing over their flags every time they encountered him.\u201cYeah\u2026 You\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cHe might be Kim YuWon, but he\u2019s still only one guy\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd we have people like Hoon and Ro\u2019el. Our team isn\u2019t short of skilled players.\u201dMost people were agreeing with Ro\u2019el.Hoon kept his mouth shut and listened closely.Finally\u2026\u201cSo that decides it right?\u201d\u2026 Team B had made a decision.\u201cLet\u2019s get the \u2018king\u2019 and Kim YuWon.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70It had been 12 hours since the start of the 11th Floor test, exactly the midpoint of the test.During that time, YuWon went over the forest with a fine comb. Every few monsters, one of them would have a flag, and whenever he ran into players of Team B, he took their flags.YuWon was like an unstoppable tank. No matter how many people there were, they couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201cI-I\u2019ll hand mine over!\u201d\u201cMe too! Here. I\u2019ll leave it behind.\u201d\u201cPlease just spare me. Please\u2026\u201dPlayers of Team B all got scared and handed over their flags when they met YuWon.Since they were willingly handing over their flags, there was no reason for YuWon to fight them. So he just simply collected the flags they left behind.[You obtained 2 flags.][You obtained 20cp.][You obtained a flag.][You obtained\u2026]YuWon obtained seven flags this time around.\u2018That makes 100 flags.\u2019YuWon checked his CP, which was exactly 1,000 points.\u2018And if I hand this over to the king, that\u2019ll be another 1,000 points.\u2019YuWon didn\u2019t trust Halimun yet. To him, Halimun was basically a deadweight. If by some accident he died or had his flag stolen by an enemy player, the results of the test would end up set in stone.YuWon would hand over the flag at the last moment, right before the 24-hour mark would be over. That was what Yuwon was waiting for.\u2018But this is strange,\u2019 YuWon thought, thinking back to the players he had just met. \u2018How do they know my face?\u2019His name was pretty well-known. Tests had public records, and having set new records, it was inevitable for his name to become well-known. But just because his name was well-known, didn\u2019t mean his face should have been well-known, and yet the players earlier handed over their flags right away as if they knew YuWon.That meant only one thing.\u201cThey must have exchanged information,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cHuh? Information?\u201d Halimun asked.\u201cThey probably told each other that I\u2019m with the \u2018king.\u2019 As teammates, they should have exchanged their kit numbers.\u201d\u201cSo they know that you\u2019re with me\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd so avoided me. Also\u2026\u201d YuWon trailed off.Just now, no, since even earlier, the actions of the players on Team B were unified.\u201cThey probably promised to run away if they encountered me.\u201d\u201cBy giving up their flags?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBut how are they supposed to win the test then?\u201dNo matter how large the difference in the power of the teams were, giving up their hard-earned flags at every corner couldn\u2019t possibly be a winning strategy.On top of that, YuWon was moving at a pace that was so fast that Halimun could barely keep up with him.\u2018There\u2019s no way they don\u2019t know that\u2026\u2019 Halimun wondered.\u201cIt\u2019s so they can secure certain victory\u2026\u201d YuWon said.There were now 12 hours left in the test. With half of the test now over, the dynamics of the test was shaping up.\u201c\u2026 By getting you and me,\u201d YuWon finished.Halimun wanted to ask, \u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026\u201d but he was interrupted by YuWon\u2019s eyes turning red and his atmosphere changing.\u201c\u2026 They\u2019re coming.\u201dRustle\u2014Whoosh\u2014!YuWon grabbed an arrow flying towards them midair.Snatch\u2014!\u201cAgh!\u201dFlop\u2014Halimun fell backwards on his ass from how surprised he was.The target of the arrow wasn\u2019t YuWon but Halimun. Their goal was to eliminate the \u2018king\u2019 first.Yuwon turned his head towards the source of the arrow.Players of Team B whispered to each other.\u201cHe blocked it.\u201d\u201cWhy would you aim for the \u2018king\u2019 first?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way something like this would have worked on YuWon.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018king\u2019 has to be present, so he\u2019s at a disadvantage while fighting since he had to protect the \u2018king.\u2019\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what you think. As long as we can get the \u2018king,\u2019 why does it matter if YuWon is alive or not?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Without a \u2018king,\u2019 even the great YuWon won\u2019t be able to do a thing\u2026\u201dA few players\u2026 No, it was more than just a few players.YuWon looked around. Some were quite far away, but a large number of players were surrounding him.\u2018It must be Heaven\u2019s Net,\u2019 YuWon thought.Meaning a net woven with the skies, the Heaven\u2019s Net was a technique long-used in the Martial Realm to surround someone.Yuwon was surrounded by a large number of players from Team B. From a rough estimate, there were at least 50 players present, with none of them being easy pushovers.Even the arrow that was aimed at Halimun just now was very fast and accurate.A band of about 50 players. Among them were some players that YuWon had let go.\u201cI guess I should have just killed all of them,\u201d YuWon said.Halimun, eyes filled with fear, looked over at YuWon. To be able to say something so brazen so casually while in this situation. YuWon appeared both way too laid back and reliable at the same time.Halimun gulped.He asked Yuwon as calmly as he could, \u201cWhat do we do now?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dShing\u2014YuWon drew his sword and flicked it around. Within a single blink, a circle had been drawn around Halimun.\u201cDon\u2019t leave this circle. The moment you leave, consider yourself dead,\u201d YuWon warned Halimun.\u201cWhat? From here?\u201d Halimun responded.Halimun looked around his surroundings. They were inside a forest, but he was standing in a relatively open spot.The reason why the archer from Team B aimed at him in this situation was likely due to the terrain advantage.So Halimun couldn\u2019t understand YuWon\u2019s order to stand out in the open rather than hide deeper into the forest.\u201cA-Are you telling me to die right now?\u201d he asked.\u201cWho told you to die? I\u2019m just telling you to stand there and don\u2019t leave.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026!\u201d\u201cI told you at the start as well. I told you not to die while wandering around, and you almost got yourself killed because you moved around.\u201dThat comment from YuWon shut Halimun up.YuWon was right. He had warned him to stay still at the starting point, yet, unable to properly understand YuWon\u2019s instructions, Halimun went off to search for flags with his companions.And after almost dying, the one who saved him was YuWon.\u201cIf you do that again, I can\u2019t help you this time,\u201d YuWon told him firmly.\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d Halimun grunted while looking down at the floor.It was a small circle, only about four meters in diameter. It was small enough to leave with just a few steps.\u201cS-So I just have to stay in this circle?\u201d Halimun asked.\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2019ll be able to live?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cYou really, honestly promise to save me\u2014\u201d\u201cI said, \u2018yes,\u2019\u201d YuWon cut off Halimun, and he started to get a move on.Halimun was shocked. Despite telling him to stay still, why was YuWon moving?\u201cWhere are you going?!\u201d Halimun shouted. He was so shocked, he almost chased after YuWon like a child that was being abandoned.YuWon turned his head around and said, \u201cCircle.\u201dWith that single word, Halimun stopped in his tracks. The line was right in front of his foot.\u201cDon\u2019t leave the circle,\u201d YuWon warned him.Tmp, tmp\u2014Unable to do anything, Halimun just blanked out while standing. He felt as if he had been thrown in the middle of a den of beasts.* * *55 people. That was the number of players deployed to get YuWon and the \u2018king,\u2019 but they were all primarily here to defeat YuWon.\u2018This is incredible,\u2019 thought Varr. He was one of the players of Team B, and he was amazed by all the players that had come together for this task. \u2018NamGung Hoon, Ro\u2019el, Salamov, Spyros, Kaichel, Oroll\u2026\u2019They were all players that he had only ever heard of. Especially Hoon and Ro\u2019el. They were like stars to the players of the lower floors.\u2018To be able to form a party with them\u2026\u2019 Varr thought. The fact that he was a part of this party boosted his confidence.Varr was also somewhat known in the lower floors for his strength. With a bit of recognition himself, he was certainly qualified to be a part of the party.\u2018The achievement of defeating YuWon is definitely going to help my career. If I can leverage that properly, I might even be able to attract the attention of bigger guilds.\u2019It was a fact that many guilds were observing this test. This was plainly obvious to any player that knew even a little bit about how things went in the Tower.A fight between 55 players and Kim YuWon. This fight would dictate which players would gain the most attention on the lower floors.\u201cHe\u2019s moving,\u201d said one of the players who was observing YuWon and the \u2018king\u2019 with his recon skills.This woke Varr from his happy daydream, making him focus back on the situation at hand. It was his teammates\u2019 responsibility to observe YuWon\u2019s movements, but it was now also time for him to start moving with his teammates.\u201cIs he running away?\u201d\u201cNo. He\u2019s coming deeper into the forest.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s walking into the forest?\u201d\u201cI think he\u2019s intending to fight, but\u2026\u201d the player observing YuWon trailed off, his eyes widening.Annoyed, Varr pressed him, \u201cBut what?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s leaving the \u2018king\u2019 behind and moving alone.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s moving alone?\u201dThey had heard that YuWon and the \u2018king\u2019 were moving together, which was true, so it confused Varr why he suddenly changed tactics now.Varr quickly set that confusion aside, smirking.\u201cMove aside a sec,\u201d Varr said, standing up from his spot and pushing two players aside.Tmp, tmp\u2014Varr grabbed the spear he had set down on the ground.The spear was over two meters long, thick, and made entirely of steel.Varr held up his weapon and got into position to throw his spear.\u201cArrows are weak,\u201d Varr stated.Clench\u2014His grip tightened, and his arm muscles bulged. As if he was becoming a giant bow being drawn, his back bent far backwards.\u2018One\u2026 Two\u2026\u2019\u201cThree\u2026!\u201dBoom\u2014!The spear shot out of Varr\u2019s hand.An excellent marksman can know if their shot will hit even before they fire their gun, and a spearman knows if their throw will hit the moment the spear leaves their hand. And in this moment, Varr was certain.\u2018It\u2019s going to hit!\u2019The spear that left his hand would perfectly penetrate Team A\u2019s \u2018king,\u2019 and as expected, his spear flew in a perfect trajectory.Varr smirked. He just became the one who led their team to victory. He had become the great spear thrower Varr\u2026\u201cHuh?!\u201d Varr exclaimed, while watching his accelerating spear.The spear suddenly stopped, floating in mid air.Varr said, \u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201dOne of Varr\u2019s teammates asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on\u2026?\u201dPshk\u2014!A chilling sound came from right beside Varr.He looked over, and the teammate that was standing right beside him was now missing half his head.\u2018This is\u2026\u2019 Varr inspected the wound. It was a wound inflicted from a piercing spear. \u2018Could it be?\u2019Varr quickly turned his head, seeing that the spear that was in midair had disappeared.Another teammate shouted, \u201cVarr! Over here\u2014kugh!\u201d The teammate let out a choking sound.Varr looked over, and he saw his teammate\u2019s body floating in midair.Anyone that wasn\u2019t braindead could tell that something was there.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cSo this side was a dud.\u201dFsss\u2014From thin air, the form of a person appeared holding Varr\u2019s teammate by the neck, inflicting pain.Crunch\u2014Bones broke from the powerful grip.The two teammates accompanying him were dead.The one who crushed his teammate by the neck turned to Varr and slowly walked over.Step, step\u2014\u201cNow tell me,\u201d YuWon asked, crimson eyes flashing, \u201cwhere is NamGung Hoon?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Salamov opened his eyes.His eyes had turned white, and he was able to see hundreds of meters around him.Salamov was a well-known recon player in the lower floors.\u201cHe\u2019s gone,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cGone?\u201dSalamov nodded his head.He had his sights on YuWon just a moment ago, and then he suddenly disappeared.There was only one possibility as to what happened.\u201cIt must be some stealth ability,\u201d Salamov remarked.There wasn\u2019t a lot of information known about YuWon. The few players that managed to see YuWon fight on his way up to the 11th Floor said that he was a melee swordsman, and that was true.The players of Team B that came across YuWon said that he used a sword.But there had been zero information that said that he was capable of [Stealth.]\u201cStealth?\u201d\u201cHe has such a skill?\u201d\u201cIs there any way we can find him?\u201dSalamov shook his head. His skill, the [Thousand-Mile Eyes,] was a rare skill that, depending on the proficiency, could literally see as far as a thousand miles, and it was even capable of seeing through most [Stealth.] Yet Salamov couldn\u2019t see even a trace of YuWon.Salamov spoke with a frown, \u201cI can\u2019t say for certain without getting closer, but I don\u2019t think this is an ordinary Stealth.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIt must be a pretty powerful skill. I can\u2019t even see a shimmer,\u201d Salamov explained.His explanation left his teammates in shock.The [Thousand-Mile Eyes] was a pretty famous skill. Its reputation as a detection skill made even Rankers desire it, and this skill was the sole reason why Salamov came to be well-known in the lower floors.According to the rumors, he\u2019d already made a contract with a major guild, so his skills were not in question.So for Salamov to say such a thing\u2026\u201cKim YuWon was an assassin?\u201d said one of the players.\u2026 That was the natural conclusion one would come to.However, Salamov shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case. Assassins typically don\u2019t wield\u00a0long swords. Not to mention that they intentionally wear dark clothes,\u201d he said.\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201cMy guess is\u2026\u201d Salamov trailed off, turning his head quickly. Salamov\u2019s eyes were still white, meaning his [Thousand-Mile Eyes] was still active. \u201cWhen did you get all the way here?\u201d he asked.Salamov\u2019s question shocked his teammates, making them draw their weapons.There was a faint shimmer in the direction of Salamov\u2019s gaze.\u201cIs that the Thousand-Mile Eyes? You have a pretty good skill,\u201d YuWon said, revealing himself.Salamov\u2019s teammates breathed a sigh of relief. If Salamov wasn\u2019t present, they would have all been assassinated without knowing what was going on.\u2018What the\u2014?\u2019\u2018So he is an assassin!\u2019Because YuWon didn\u2019t socialize with other players, there was little information known about him. So without directly facing him, it was impossible to figure out what his abilities might be.Salamov was among the confused.Earlier, if he hadn\u2019t seen the faint shimmer, he would have ended up with the same fate as everyone else.\u2018There\u2019s a stealth skill that I couldn\u2019t see through with the Thousand-Mile Eyes at this distance?\u2019 Salamov couldn\u2019t believe it. He wondered if perhaps YuWon really was a player specialized in assasination.\u2018Let\u2019s hope that is the case. Because if he\u2019s not an assassin, and he can use Stealth at this distance\u2026\u2019 gulped Salamov, \u2018\u2026 it\u2019ll be close to impossible to defeat him.\u2019\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because you guys don\u2019t have a lot of people, but your Heaven\u2019s Net is too flawed,\u201d said YuWon while looking around.Team B players that were spread out started gathering closer together, and the wide Heaven\u2019s Net started to tighten.\u201cEven if it\u2019s you, now that you\u2019ve revealed yourself, you can\u2019t do a thing,\u201d Salamov told YuWon.Salamov could see the dozens of players surrounding YuWon, their gazes aimed at YuWon\u2019s vitals. Dozens of skills and weapons were all ready to fire.This was a stage prepared for YuWon.\u201cIt was a wise choice to separate yourself from the \u2018king,\u2019 since you can\u2019t fight us at full power if you\u2019re protecting someone,\u201d said Salamov.YuWon was looking elsewhere during Salamov\u2019s explanation. This made Salamov frown. He took a step towards YuWon.Salamov shouted, \u201cHey, are you listening to me\u2026?\u201dA chill went down Salamov\u2019s spine, shutting him up and making him take a step back.Finally YuWon\u2019s gaze looked to Salamov.\u201cYou have good instincts,\u201d YuWon complimented.Slice\u2014Salamov looked down at the ground in front of him. There was a fresh cut on the ground.Despite being more than ten steps away, YuWon had managed to cut from that distance.Salamov gulped, realizing the danger of moving recklessly.There weren\u2019t many players that were capable of fighting head to head against YuWon.Tmp, tmp\u2014People started to appear out of the forest.There were roughly 20 players, most of which YuWon didn\u2019t recognize.The only two faces that YuWon did recognize were Hoon\u2019s and Ro\u2019el\u2019s. Hoon, the genius of the NamGung Clan who was expected to become a High Ranker one day, and Ro\u2019el, the one nicknamed an angel because people say that she was blessed by god.YuWon knew their faces because both would become Rankers in the future.\u201cYou abandoned your \u2018king\u2019\u2026\u201d Hoon said while raising his greatsword. \u201cSo you chose battle over the test.\u201dBeing capable of lifting a heavy greatsword with one hand made Hoon look reliable.On top of Hoon and Ro\u2019el, the other 20 players present were also the cream of the crop on Team B. And in the distance, there were dozens of players waiting and aiming for YuWon.The best way to describe this situation would be to say that he was a cornered rat. In fact, he had walked into this trap himself.Tmp, tmp\u2014Hoon walked towards YuWon, getting even closer than where Salamov was. Considering his skills and the length of his sword, Hoon was now more than capable of reaching YuWon with his sword, yet YuWon didn\u2019t stop him.YuWon could tell by the atmosphere. NamGung Hoon. He was essentially the one leading Team B.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that it\u2019s come to this\u2026\u201d Hoon apologized, bowing his head to YuWon.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d YuWon asked.Hoon responded, \u201cThough unintentional, I have a good team, unlike you.\u201dThe teams were picked randomly, yet the differences between the two teams were too great.Hoon turned his head and looked around. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of this situation because this is a test. You are certainly a very skilled player. It\u2019s just that your luck didn\u2019t match your skills,\u201d he said.\u201cWhat are you trying to say?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cGive up on the test. I don\u2019t want to have a match like this.\u201dYuWon smirked. Telling him to \u2018give up.\u2019 He was wondering what Hoon was on about, but for it to have been this\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re more talkative than I heard,\u201d YuWon said, raising his sword and displaying how he had zero intentions to give up on the test.* * *Hoon let out a sigh. He had expected this, but he was still disappointed. It seemed that things had to happen this way.\u201cI guess it can\u2019t be helped then,\u201d Hoon said while also raising his sword.As if they had made an agreement ahead of time, the other players did not intervene. It was a 1v1 situation.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d YuWon hummed while letting out a small laugh. Hoon didn\u2019t have a bad personality.\u2018Back then and now. His personality is still the same,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.Hoon had a cool-headed personality. He was rational and made quick judgements. It was how he was able to climb the Tower quickly and become a Ranker. And on top of that, Hoon was not a coward.Being rational and uncowardly, even in a situation like this, Hoon wished to have a one-on-one duel with YuWon.And YuWon liked people like him, so if possible, he didn\u2019t want to kill him. Especially because in the future, Hoon had great things he had to do for the NamGung Clan.\u201cI don\u2019t really care how many people there are,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cThat makes me feel a bit better,\u201d Hoon said, taking a step towards YuWon.In that moment\u2026Whoosh\u2014Hoon\u2019s sword drew an arc and\u2026Klang\u2014!\u2026 Their swords clashed.The heavy greatsword exerted a lot of pressure, making YuWon\u2019s eyes light up.\u2018Would you look at that,\u2019 YuWon thought.He knew very well that the NamGung Clan\u2019s sword was heavy because in his past life he took the 10th Floor\u2019s test with the NamGung Clan.\u2018I guess he\u2019s a gem for a reason,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself, impressed by the strength of a player who was currently only at the 11th Floor. It made him genuinely curious what Hoon\u2019s stats were.\u201cHmph\u2014!\u201d Hoon let out a deep breath, swinging his sword repeatedly.There was no reason that a heavy sword had to be slow. As an example of this, Hoon\u2019s sword was quick and moved with the full extent of his strength.The players watched the fight in a daze, wondering how Hoon could put so much strength into his swings while moving so fast.Watching Hoon made YuWon think, \u2018He\u2019s definitely a martial arts genius.\u2019YuWon was called a genius plenty as well, but he was not as much of a genius as Hoon when it came to martial arts.\u2018Not bad,\u2019 YuWon remarked.Whoosh\u2014Whoosh\u2014Klang\u2014!Hoon\u2019s sword was deflected, making it swing upwards. His eyes widened from the pain that made him think his hand was about to break.\u2018What is this strength\u2026?!\u2019 Hoon wondered.His hands were numb, making him almost lose his grip on his sword.The NamGung Clan\u2019s sword was heavy. And the clan\u2019s Imperial Sword Form had a power that could exert pressure on one\u2019s surroundings just by wielding the sword. And this principle was naturally baked into Hoon\u2019s sword techniques.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019 Hoon was confused.Klang\u2014!Once again, Hoon\u2019s sword was deflected.When his sword clashed with YuWon\u2019s sword, it felt like both his feet got lifted off the ground.There was an unbelievable difference in power.\u2018I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m being pushed back in terms of strength,\u2019 Hoon thought while gritting his teeth.A blue shimmer started blooming around Hoon\u2019s sword. And at the same time, an enormous, mountain-like power was imbued into his sword.\u201cHmph\u2014!\u201d Hoon grunted.[Archangel\u2019s Blessing empowers you.][Your Strength increases.][Your Constitution increases.][Your body becomes lighter.][Your mana regeneration accelerates.]An unexpected power strengthened Hoon and his sword.Crash\u2014!YuWon and Hoon\u2019s swords collided with each other.Despite swinging with his all, YuWon\u2019s sword didn\u2019t budge an inch. But what preoccupied Hoon\u2019s mind the most were the messages that popped up a moment ago.Hoon turned his head and saw that the tip of Ro\u2019el\u2019s hand was pointing towards him.Shnnk\u2014With an exchange of sword swings, Hoon and YuWon ended up some distance away from each other.Hoon took this chance to glare at Ro\u2019el.\u201cWhat is the meaning of this?\u201d he asked. He had made it clear that he\u2019d first fight YuWon one on one.\u201cThis is all you can do even after receiving my buff. Doesn\u2019t that mean this match is already over?\u201d Ro\u2019el said.The power that had buffed Hoon a moment ago was Ro\u2019el\u2019s doing, and she was already buffing the other players, having judged YuWon and Hoon\u2019s fight to be over.Hoon grit his teeth. He was completely uninjured, meaning the fight was only just starting for him.\u201cIt\u2019s far from over yet\u2014\u201d Hoon argued.\u201cIt looks like he thinks it\u2019s over though.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dFwoosh\u2014Hoon turned his head and felt a wave of heat on his face.It was an extremely hot fire, but what really caught his attention wasn\u2019t the heat.\u2018That fire is\u2026\u2019 Hoon thought to himself.A purple fire had appeared around YuWon, making Hoon think back to a scene.\u2018Agrea\u2019s dungeon\u2026\u2019 Hoon\u2019s eyes widened. \u2018Could it be?\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Purple flames were not common. At the very least, Hoon had never seen or heard of them before.\u2018This can\u2019t be a mere coincidence,\u2019 Hoon thought, recollecting the traces left behind at Agrea\u2019s Dungeon.He could vividly remember the wounds left on the dungeon\u2019s boss, the Spider Queen Agrea. The sword wound so sharp, precise, and destructive that it made him wonder if it was the doing of a Ranker.\u2018So why\u2026?\u2019 he wondered.The sword that he felt when he traded blows with YuWon was completely different from what had made the cut on Agrea\u2019s body. With YuWon\u2019s power, it should have been impossible to cut the dungeon\u2019s boss with a single strike.That left only two possibilities.\u2018Either I\u2019m mistaken, or\u2026 he was going easy against me,\u2019 Hoon concluded.Judging by how YuWon\u2019s response didn\u2019t change from before or after Ro\u2019el\u2019s buff, he had an idea of what the truth might be.Hoon gritted his teeth. The duel was basically over, and if YuWon really was the one who conquered Agrea\u2019s Dungeon\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s retreat,\u201d Hoon spoke to Ro\u2019el using sonic telepathy.**TL/N: A martial art skill where one uses ki to transfer sound to their target.Ro\u2019el turned her head towards Hoon in shock. She then glared at him in confusion. She couldn\u2019t understand why he wanted them to retreat.\u201cIf YuWon is the same person as the one I\u2019m thinking of, this fight is meaningless,\u201d Hoon continued speaking in secrecy to Ro\u2019el, staring at the purple fire floating around YuWon. \u201cWe will all die.\u201dRo\u2019el was at a crossroads with how certain Hoon sounded.Hoon normally didn\u2019t say anything unless he was certain. Coupled with the fact that he was always confident and had the skills to back it up, Ro\u2019el wondered what could possibly make Hoon suggest that they retreat first.YuWon looked back and forth between Ro\u2019el and Hoon. After standing still for a moment, his eyes now red, he took a step towards them and asked, \u201cAre you guys done talking?\u201dHoon flinched in surprise before nodding his head.YuWon noticed he was communicating with Ro\u2019el through sonic telepathy, yet he waited for them.\u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d said Hoon.YuWon stopped in his tracks and nodded. \u201cIf it\u2019s only one question.\u201d\u201cAre you the one that conquered Agrea\u2019s Dungeon?\u201dAgrea\u2019s Dungeon. The mention of it made the players around him murmur in shock.It was a difficult dungeon that hadn\u2019t been conquered in a long time. The fact that the dungeon was conquered was shocking, but the players could accept that it had happened, considering it was YuWon.\u201cWhat if I tell you that it was?\u201d YuWon answered.\u201c\u2026 So I was right,\u201d Hoon responded. In that moment, he was able to, by proxy, get a taste of YuWon\u2019s true strength.\u201cIf you guys want to fight him, we\u2019re out. Let\u2019s go,\u201d Hoon commanded his teammates.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHey, Hoon!\u201d\u201cAre we really leaving?\u201dHoon\u2019s unexpected actions made his shocked teammates chase after him.Ro\u2019el bit her lip from the sudden development. \u201cYou\u2019re a coward, unlike the rumors,\u201d she insulted Hoon.\u201cFeel free to say whatever you want,\u201d Hoon said while looking back at YuWon. \u201cI value my teammates\u2019 lives more than my pride.\u201dOne could always retry a test.The test fee was pretty expensive, but points weren\u2019t a problem for Hoon. Not only did he have quite a lot of points saved up, but if needed, he could always ask his clan as well.However, there was no re-do for your life.Even if the entirety of Team B fought YuWon at once and somehow managed to defeat him\u2026\u2018At least half\u2026 no, most of us would die,\u2019 Hoon predicted, and he didn\u2019t want to pass the test like that.From the beginning, he didn\u2019t like this test, so quitting here was an option in itself.\u201cHoon\u2026\u201d\u201cSniffle\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re so\u2026\u201dHoon\u2019s teammates were touched by his statement.In response, Hoon waved at them to hurry up.YuWon had no intention to stop them. \u2018If they\u2019ll step out on their own, that\u2019s fine by me,\u2019 he thought.It wasn\u2019t bad for YuWon for there to be fewer enemies to fight.Hoon put down his flag on the ground, and his teammates followed suit. It was clear that Hoon\u2019s teammates had a great amount of trust in him.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d Ro\u2019el muttered with a frown, watching Hoon and his teammates walk away.Now there were only 40 members of Team B present. They still outnumbered YuWon greatly, but the absence of Hoon was a huge loss as he was the most skilled player on Team B.\u2018Still\u2026\u2019 Ro\u2019el thought while looking over at YuWon. He was truly delectable-looking prey.With Hoon gone, if they could defeat YuWon, the glory would be all hers.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d\u201cWe still outnumber him\u2026\u201d\u201cThe numbers aren\u2019t the issue here!\u201d\u201cDammit. Maybe I should have left with Hoon.\u201dThere were many hesitating, but no one was actually giving up. This was thanks to the power rising within them that filled them with courage.\u201cSo no one else wants to give up. Tch,\u201d YuWon said in disappointment. He had hoped that more would change their minds with Hoon leaving.\u201cI\u2019m saying this just in case, but don\u2019t kill too many kids. It\u2019s unsightly for an adult to run amok in the middle of children fighting,\u201d said the hero Hercules. Even in the middle of the meeting to pick who would go back in time, Hercules was worried about the players\u2019 lives.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cThey are the guys that we need to fight the Outers together later\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who we\u2019re sending, but whoever it may be, they\u2019re bound to run into some future Rankers.\u201d\u201cAnd that will be a loss for our side.\u201dIt was a promise made in the middle of the meeting. As long as it was within their abilities, they would climb the Tower in a way that saved players rather than killed them. Because at the end of the day, it was the Inners, the beings inside the Tower, that had to fight against the Outers. So if possible, they had to avoid killing players and Rankers.Not only that, but they had to prevent events that could result in a big casualty for the Inners. That was the task at hand for YuWon.\u2018That is what I\u2019m supposed to do\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought.So far he had kept that promise the best he could. As long as they weren\u2019t scum like Kim MyungHoon or actual villains, he took the test in a way that saved people.\u2018But what can I do when they\u2019re baring their fangs so much\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought.Hercules insisted that they should save people rather than kill them, and Hercules would have indeed figured out a way. He had the ability to make such things happen because, as a hero, that was what he lived for.However, YuWon was different.\u2018I can\u2019t guarantee anything.\u2019YuWon liked Hercules for being a hero, but he himself could not be one.Fwoosh\u2014[Holy Fire]The fire around YuWon started to grow more intense.In response, the players on Team B started to prepare their skills one by one.\u2018I\u2019ll give it my best shot\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought.His will made the fire roar bigger.\u2018\u2026 But if it can\u2019t be helped, it can\u2019t be helped.\u2019The fire enveloping YuWon\u2019s body opened its mouth.It was now time for him to butt into a children\u2019s fight.* * *Tmp, tmp\u2014Hoon headed to Team B\u2019s original starting point.His teammates were busy trying to gauge the situation. They initially left according to Hoon\u2019s will, but they wondered if this was really okay.\u201cAre you really going to give up?\u201d one of Hoon\u2019s teammates asked.The question prompted Hoon to stop in his tracks and turn around.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Hoon asked.The teammate that asked the question was surprised. He didn\u2019t think Hoon would go as far as to stop and turn around.\u201cI-It\u2019s just it\u2019s not like you.\u201d\u201cNot like me?\u201d Hoon wondered.\u201cI get that the opponent is really strong, but it\u2019s not like you to give up without even properly fighting\u2026\u201dHoon let out a sigh. His teammate wasn\u2019t wrong.He hadn\u2019t lived that long of a life, but this was the first time this had happened as well.\u201cI didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Hoon said.\u201cDon\u2019t like what?\u201dHoon continued, \u201cPassing the test like this and making YuWon fail like this.\u201dHoon looked back in the direction he came from.He had traveled quite a long distance, but he could feel that the fight had started by the intense flow of mana.\u201cEven if we did fight, we can\u2019t win\u2026 But if that was the only factor, I might have fought. Because if all of us fought together, we might have had even the slightest chance. However\u2026\u201dHoon took a momentary pause before continuing.\u201c\u2026 The one that deserves to pass this test isn\u2019t me.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dHoon\u2019s explanation made his teammates nod in agreement.To begin with, this test\u2019s roster made no sense. The difference between Team A and Team B was ridiculously unbalanced.Despite that, YuWon was making up for that gap by himself.So based purely on skills, YuWon was more than qualified to be one to move onto the next floor.\u201cYou\u2019re too uptight.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s got a point.\u201d\u201cI guess there\u2019s always the next test.\u201d\u201cIt seems like a waste to let our team luck go like this, but this is why I like you.\u201dHoon\u2019s teammates weren\u2019t all that disappointed because as long as they had the skills, they could always move onto the next floor with the next test.A smile of satisfaction bloomed on Hoon\u2019s face.He was relieved because he had been worried on the off chance that his teammates might have been dissatisfied with his decision.\u2018They really are a good team,\u2019 he thought, thinking back to what his father, NamGung JinWoon told him.His father insisted that the things required to climb the Tower weren\u2019t only excellent skills and power. What was equally as important were amazing teammates to climb the Tower together with.Starting from the Tutorial, Hoon searched for teammates to climb the Tower with him. And because he took the task of climbing the Tower seriously, he spent a long time selecting his teammates.That was how he ended up with his current team. A team that was not only skilled but had the same moral code as him. And Hoon greatly liked his current team.\u201cNow then, let\u2019s go back\u2026\u201d Hoon trailed off while turning around to continue back to the starting point.He spotted a player shining gold walking towards him in the distance.\u2018The \u2018king\u2019?\u2019 Hoon wondered.It was Team B\u2019s \u2018king.\u2019 The player he didn\u2019t know the name or face of. The player he couldn\u2019t remember a single thing about had appeared.* * *[You obtained a flag.][You obtained 10cp.][You obtained 2 flags.][You obtained\u2026]Multiple messages rang in quick succession.YuWon picked up the flags that had dropped and rummaged through the players that were lying on the ground.It was a message that felt good to see because the more flags he had, the higher his chance of passing this test went up, and the more CP he obtained, the bigger his reward would become.\u201cAhhhh!\u201d\u201cH-Hot!\u201d\u201cSomeone, save me\u2026\u201d\u201cI-It\u2019s a demon! Ahhhhh!\u201d\u201cGo away!\u201dThe entire place had erupted into chaos.Despite the name \u2018Holy Fire,\u2019 YuWon looked like a demon to the players. But that was inevitable.\u2018That\u2019s just how the power of an Outer is,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.The power of an Outer was a power from outside the Tower.People had an instinctive fear of the unknown. The \u300cHoly Fire\u300d was a foreign power to them, so it evolved into what they feared the most.And so the \u300cHoly Fire\u300d grew by consuming their fear to grow larger. This made YuWon\u2019s job not to make the flame bigger but to control it and reign it in.\u2018If the fire grows too big, it\u2019ll become hard even for me to control.\u2019YuWon put out some of the fire and looked around.The test site had descended into utter chaos. Dozens of players were already unable to fight anymore.There were a few players that were putting up a good fight against the \u300cHoly Fire,\u300d but they wouldn\u2019t last long.\u2018There\u2019s no way this is going to end here\u2026\u2019This test was a stage set up by Olympus to get YuWon. There was no way the only trap they had set up for him was inconveniencing him by ruining the balance of the teams. There was bound to be a more surefire, secure trap set up for him.After the Heaven\u2019s Net was enacted, YuWon had been searching for a single player with his \u300cCinder Eyes,\u300d and finally\u2026\u2018You\u2019re here\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought, seeing the player in the distance that he had been searching for. \u2018The \u2018king.\u2019\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73[Holy Blessing][Angel\u2019s Wings][Strength of a Giant]In a hurry, Ro\u2019el directed her skills at the players spread around her.She made their bodies lighter, protected their bodies from the fire, buffed their strength, and more. She had used over ten types of buffs on her team.Her abilities were so versatile that any team with her on board could double their power.But then why\u2026?\u2018What\u2019s up with this?\u2019 Ro\u2019el wondered. She started sweating seeing YuWon just standing still.She was unable to stop the fire YuWon controlled with her skills.On top of that, the dozens of players were busy running from the fire as if they were put under some illusion.No matter how powerful a buff she casted, nothing would change. She couldn\u2019t stop the fire, nor could they injure YuWon, let alone approach him.Ro\u2019el grit her teeth, focused her sights, and aimed her hands at YuWon.She specialized in healing and buffing, but those weren\u2019t the only abilities she had. If that were the case, she wouldn\u2019t have managed to become nearly as famous as she was.Whirrrr\u2014Above YuWon\u2019s head, a giant, yellow, glowing sword appeared.[Sword of Execution]It was the only attack skill that the Angel Ro\u2019el possessed, but that was good enough because this skill was said to be one of the most lethal man-to-man attack skills.\u201cDie!\u201d Ro\u2019el shouted as she swung her hands down.The sword made of light above YuWon\u2019s head fell toward him.In response\u2026Shnk\u2014\u2026 YuWon, who had been standing still all this time, drew his sword.Thwack\u2014!Whirrrrr\u2014The [Sword of Execution] released a powerful light, enough to light up the whole forest.Ro\u2019el and the other players heard the loud ringing caused by the collision.Riiiiing\u2014It echoed in their ears.Through the blinding light, Ro\u2019el could see her sword getting shattered.\u2018The Sword of Execution\u2026\u2019Ro\u2019el\u2019s eyes widened.The shock from what she witnessed made her numb to the blinding light.Her [Sword of Execution] was destroyed, not even by some special skill, but from a normal swing of a sword.Ro\u2019el had a flashback of what Hoon told her.\u201cWe will all die.\u201dRo\u2019el\u2019s eyes locked with YuWon.She felt a shiver down her spine and even took a step back subconsciously.There didn\u2019t seem to be anything she could do against him.\u201cThis is cheating\u2026\u201d she muttered.After looking around, Ro\u2019el noticed that most of the players had already run away.She changed her mind. \u2018There\u2019s no point in fighting anymore.\u2019Hoon was right. Ro\u2019el didn\u2019t know what made him come to that conclusion, but YuWon was not an opponent they could face.Even though he was still only a player, his strength was beyond their measure.Ro\u2019el bit her lip.\u201cEveryone, let\u2019s retreat,\u201d Ro\u2019el telepathically communicated to all the players of Team B that had received a buff from her. \u201cWe don\u2019t stand a chance. If all of us die here, even if we get his \u2018king,\u2019 we will still lose this test.\u201dAfter hearing Ro\u2019el\u2019s words, the players of Team B looked at one another and nodded their heads.She was right.Their original plan was to get YuWon and the \u2018king,\u2019 but currently both seemed impossible.\u201cMake sure you leave your flags behind,\u201d YuWon said out loud.This caught Ro\u2019el off guard.\u201cDid you hear all that?\u201d she asked.YuWon responded, \u201cI don\u2019t need to hear anything to know what\u2019s going on in your head.\u201d\u201c\u2026 And if I say we\u2019re just going to leave?\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let you guys go,\u201d YuWon said while signaling with his fingers to hand the flags over.He did feel like he was taking a kid\u2019s lunch money, but that was kind of what was happening.After contemplating, Ro\u2019el ended up handing her flags over.[You obtained 8 flags.][You obtained 80cp.]As expected, she had quite a few flags on her.This was one more than the seven flags that Hoon had on him.\u2018A support plays a bigger role in the team than a lone swordsman, so that makes sense,\u2019 YuWon thought.It was a natural way for a team to distribute the gains.The other players followed Ro\u2019el and handed YuWon their flags.There were no casualties yet.\u201cWill you really not kill anyone?\u201d Ro\u2019el asked, as YuWon was finishing up collecting the flags.YuWon nodded. Since he got all their flags, there was no need to kill anyone.\u201cHow come? You don\u2019t seem like someone who\u2019d hesitate to kill people.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I don\u2019t particularly like killing either.\u201d\u201cWill you really be okay? You might be taking all our flags, but we\u2019ll just go collect more. You\u2019re by yourself. You might lose your \u2018king,\u2019 and with the remaining time\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you asking me to kill you?\u201d YuWon asked.After getting goosebumps from locking eyes with YuWon, Ro\u2019el took a few steps back.\u201cWhat is it that you want?\u201d YuWon followed up with another question.\u201cA talk with you,\u201d she responded.\u201cA talk?\u201d\u201cI heard that you rejected all the sponsorship offers from major guilds.\u201dYuWon nodded his head.Many players from major guilds had met up with him. He was even personally visited by a few Rankers.But every time, he said no.Ro\u2019el knew this, and that was why she had approached YuWon.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201d she asked.\u201cWhat is this? Is this a recruitment offer?\u201d\u201cZion* can offer you the best treatment possible. I\u2019m certain they\u2019ll treat you even better than me,\u201d Ro\u2019el spoke with a spark in her eyes.*TL/N: Zion means Heaven.YuWon couldn\u2019t believe she was making such an offer when just a moment ago they were fighting over the flags.\u2018So she\u2019s sponsored by Zion,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself. He was amazed that a player on the lower floors was already sponsored by such a major faction, but it made sense as Ro\u2019el\u2019s ability fit them.\u201cNo thanks,\u201d YuWon rejected her offer.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s annoying, having to repeat myself. Just leave.\u201d\u201cThen at least give me your kit number\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m always happy to get a number from a beauty. That is, unless they have an ulterior motive,\u201d YuWon said while shooing her away, \u201cSo just go. Whether it\u2019s Zion or Asgard, I have no intention of joining anywhere.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dRo\u2019el refused to give up.Without her persistent personality, she probably wouldn\u2019t have managed to make it this far so quickly.She continued, \u201cWhy are you rejecting all the offers from these major guilds? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, but the Tower isn\u2019t a place you can conquer by yourself. If you have something you desire\u2026\u201d\u201cIt is possible,\u201d YuWon cut Ro\u2019el off with an annoyed tone, \u201ceven without a major guild. No, I\u00a0have\u00a0to solo it.\u201dThat was the biggest thing the returner of the \u300cClock Movement \u300d had to keep in mind.\u201cYou can\u2019t join or get sponsored by some guild for just a little convenience.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, or they might find you suspicious.\u201d\u201cAnd to be the center that brings the Tower together, there can\u2019t be a guild backing them.\u201d\u201cThe center\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be easy.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s what needs to happen, especially when the major guilds are out to get each other.\u201d\u201cDamn bastards.\u201d\u201cWe are those bastards.\u201dThe guilds were naturally against one another, but it was the worst among the major guilds that were trying to gain the rights to the Tower.And the major guilds had been at this for too long. For far too long there had been rivalries, suspicion, and pride.So in order to bring them together as one, there needed to be a new \u2018center.\u2019\u201cNow stop being so noisy and go away. If you stay any longer, you might actually die.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ro\u2019el asked in shock, staring at YuWon.The other players had already dispersed, and Ro\u2019el realized she was the last one there.She nodded her head and answered, \u201c\u2026 I understand. Well, I hope I\u2019ll get to see you again. And hopefully we\u2019ll be on the same team next time.\u201d\u201cWhatever suits you.\u201dRo\u2019el turned around.YuWon watched her back for a second before adding, \u201cSorry, but the \u2018king\u2019 won\u2019t die.\u201dRo\u2019el turned her head back towards him.YuWon continued while playfully waving his hand, \u201cSo you should just root for me losing.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026?\u201d Ro\u2019el asked in confusion.\u201cNow carry on,\u201d YuWon told her to go.Despite her confusion, she decided to keep moving.YuWon stood in place and waited for everyone to disappear.After a few minutes had passed\u2026\u201cEveryone\u2019s gone,\u201d YuWon stated.Rustle\u2014A sound came from behind YuWon in a direction where no one was visible.Then out of nowhere, a gold light appeared.\u201cHow long were you aware?\u201d\u201cFor a while now,\u201d YuWon said while turning around, meeting face-to-face with Team B\u2019s \u2018king.\u2019A man without a face, glowing gold, the light that symbolized the \u2018king.\u2019* * *This man had moved alone to get YuWon.\u201cYou\u2019re as smart as the rumors say you are, not to mention you\u2019re also skilled,\u201d the \u2018king\u2019 said.He looked around the surrounding area and was pretty impressed. After such a fight, it wouldn\u2019t have been strange if a big fire had engulfed the forest. But instead of a fire, there weren\u2019t even any traces of scorch marks.There were plenty of skills with great firepower, but the \u2018king\u2019 had never heard of a skill that could burn selective targets like this.\u201cA fire with a will\u2026 If he saw it, he\u2019d want it,\u201d the \u2018king\u2019 mumbled while nodding his head.The \u2018king\u2019 was acting quite laid back, even though he spoke like he knew what had happened between YuWon and the others from Team B.\u201cWhat\u2019s the test examiner doing here, wearing that weird mask?\u201dYuWon\u2019s question shocked the \u2018king.\u2019 Even though his eyes, nose, and mouth were obscured to the point that no one could recall them, YuWon could see him as clear as day.The \u2018king\u2019 was no ordinary player. It was the test examiner Hypnos, a Ranker.\u201cYou can see me?\u201d Hypnos asked.\u201cCrystal clear.\u201dEarlier, YuWon\u2019s eyes had changed into [Cinder Eyes.] They were eyes that could see through everything as well as discern lies and truth.Even if the player in front of him was a Ranker, with just a simple illusion disguise, he couldn\u2019t beat the discernment of [Cinder Eyes.]\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s not possible,\u201d Hypnos said.\u201cSometimes the impossible happens.\u201d\u201cHa. You really are something.\u201dIt was a short conversation, but Hypnos was truly amazed.Even though he was found out, he didn\u2019t take off his disguise. It would be terrible if people found out that Olympus\u2019s test examiner had intervened in a test.\u201cI was honestly surprised. I didn\u2019t think that you\u2019d choose going after all the players rather than aim for the \u2018king.\u2019\u201dHypnos took on the role of the \u2018king\u2019 for one reason. He had assumed YuWon would immediately go after the \u2018king\u2019 as soon as the test started because he wanted a situation like this. The opportunity to face him one-on-one.But rather than searching for the enemy \u2018king,\u2019 YuWon moved at a leisurely pace and then picked a fight with the elites of Team B.\u201cI finally understand why the higher ups are so up in arms about you.\u201dA faint shimmer spread out from Hypnos.The faint flow of mana slowly diffused.As his vision and mind became hazy, YuWon tried his best to keep it together.Hypnos was a Ranker famous for his illusion skills.\u2018So, they even mobilized a test examiner,\u2019 YuWon thought.Fwoosh\u2014!YuWon drew out his mana and lit the \u300cHoly Fire\u300d ablaze.In contrast to the fight against the players, the [Holy Fire] burned big and loud.This was a fight he couldn\u2019t win just by taking it easy like earlier.\u2018What a mess,\u2019 YuWon thought.An officially registered Ranker had intervened in a test.Olympus had taken a huge risk considering the trouble they would be in if the Administrator found out.YuWon couldn\u2019t help but smirk.An Olympian Ranker had intervened despite being the test examiner. YuWon knew that they had laid out a trap for him\u2026\u2018How nice,\u2019 he thought.\u2026 But he was getting a much bigger catch than he had originally anticipated.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74Halimun felt like\u00a0he was going through a horror experience. He was in a situation where he didn\u2019t know when or where players from Team B would come after him.At least currently things were quiet thanks to YuWon drawing their focus.\u2018It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay\u2026\u2019 he repeated to himself.Halimun forgot to even blink.A spear or an arrow might come flying at him at any moment, like earlier, so in order to dodge, he couldn\u2019t afford to even blink for a second.Gulp\u2014His leg slid a little.Halimun desperately wanted to run away that very moment, but\u2026\u201cCircle.\u201dEvery time he even thought about it, YuWon\u2019s voice echoed in his head.\u201cDon\u2019t leave the circle.\u201dHe looked down, seeing the line of the circle drawn around him. His foot was right on the line.Halimun wondered if he should run away or if he should stay there and wait like YuWon ordered him to.\u201cPlease come back sooner\u2026\u201dHalimun decided that he had no choice but to accept his fate and wait for YuWon.After some time passed\u2026Whoosh\u2014!Finally a skill came flying towards Halimun.Boom\u2014!\u201cAck!\u201dFire exploded above his head.He managed to dodge it by ducking quickly, but the embers from the explosion still scattered on top of him.Tss, tsss\u2014Embers fell on Halimun\u2019s back. He wanted to let out a scream, but he didn\u2019t have a chance to do that.\u201cHe dodged it?\u201d\u201cSo he at least has some reflexes.\u201d\u201cBut why is this guy just standing here?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe he\u2019s asking to be killed.\u201dRustle\u2014Five players revealed themselves from the shrubbery.They were players of Team B.In an instant, they surrounded Halimun so he couldn\u2019t get away.\u201cLet\u2019s finish this quickly. Things seemed to be going pretty rough over there.\u201d\u201cAre they really struggling to get one guy?\u201d\u201cKim YuWon really must be as amazing as they say.\u201dHalimun managed to get a grasp of how things were going from the five players\u2019 conversation.\u2018Really? By himself?\u2019 Halimun thought in amazement.He wasn\u2019t sure when he saw YuWon leave confidently by himself, but it seemed that YuWon was really fighting against them on his own. And somehow YuWon was the one who was winning.\u2018That is amazing\u2026\u2019 Halimun thought, ready to burst into tears, \u2018but what about me?!\u2019It didn\u2019t matter how much he cried internally. He didn\u2019t have time to contact YuWon with the player kit, and even if he could, YuWon wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up in the middle of fighting.Besides, it was impossible for YuWon to get here in time from so far away.\u2018I need to run away\u2026\u2019Tmp\u2014Halimun took a few steps back, his foot landing on the line.It was the line that YuWon had drawn, and unfortunately what YuWon said rang in his head.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201d Halimun muttered, remembering YuWon\u2019s order to stay within the line at all cost.He brooded over YuWon\u2019s warning.It wasn\u2019t like he had a chance of running away from the five players in front of him anyway.\u201cOkay. Fine. Let\u2019s go, you motherfuckers!\u201d Halimun shouted, drawing his sword.Shing\u2014!It was a rash decision.The players in front of him might not have been on the level of Hoon or Ro\u2019el, but they were still among the top players on the 11th Floor.In contrast, Halimun had failed to pass the 11th Floor test multiple times now.Even if this was a 1V1 rather than a 5V1, it was unlikely that he\u2019d win.\u2018I can do it,\u2019 Halimun thought to himself while gritting his teeth. \u2018I can do it!\u2019He believed that he just had to buy time and that if he stalled enough, YuWon would come to save him.\u201cYou\u2019re so pathetic.\u201d\u201cHey, let\u2019s finish this already.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s divvy up the CP equally. Okay?\u201d\u201cGot it. Just divide up the flags properly later.\u201dThe players blinded by CP approached Halimun, now within a few steps of him.Without leaving the circle, Halimun swung his sword with everything he had.Whoosh\u2014The sword hit nothing but dead air.The closest player started mocking him, \u201cYou\u2019re flailing too much.\u201dThe other players didn\u2019t hold back just because there was a difference in strength. From the get-go, they hadn\u2019t viewed this as a fair fight.\u201cSo long. Just consider yourself unlucky.\u201dVwoom\u2014The same fire orb from earlier flew towards him again, but this time, it launched so close that it was unavoidable, heading right for his face.\u2018I-I\u2019m dead\u2026!\u2019As Halimun braced himself\u2026Boom\u2014!\u2026 Embers scattered right in front of his eyes.Fsss\u2014A big hand blocked the path between him and the players from Team B.Halimun turned his head, looking behind him.It was shrouded by the smoke, but there was something there that resembled a person. And that something had protected Halimun.\u201cW-What is that?\u201d\u201cA ghost?\u201d\u201cIs this his skill?\u201dThe players were taken aback by the domineering mana.They had expected this to be an easy hunt, but here an unexpected obstacle had popped up.Fsss\u2014Halimun looked at the circle that YuWon had drawn on the ground. Then his gaze moved to the thing standing at his back, as if protecting him.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201d Halimun laughed nervously.His legs shook, feeling weak.[Heavenly Demon\u2019s Spirit]There was only a single thought that filled his mind: he was going to live.* * *About ten days before the test, Hypnos received a message from Olympus.[Fail Kim YuWon.]The message was short but shocking.Knowing the possible major ramifications, Hypnos was deeply worried.A test examiner\u2019s role was to oversee possible accidents during a test or remove unfair elements in addition to managing and setting up the tests.Olympus\u2019s order was essentially asking him to rig the test.\u2018I did think it was a crazy order,\u2019 Hypnos thought.Fortunately for Hypnos, it wasn\u2019t that difficult of an order.Due to the nature of the 11th Floor\u2019s test, all he had to do was manipulate the teams\u2019 seeding a bit. It might earn him a bit of suspicion, but that in itself wouldn\u2019t cause that much of a problem. Especially since Hypnos had Olympus backing him.However\u2026\u2018To think that Lady Hera would show interest as well.\u2019Right before the test began, Hypnos got a message from Hera, a High Ranker of Olympus.[Kill Kim YuWon at any cost. The method doesn\u2019t matter.]The content of the message wasn\u2019t all that different from the original request, but the weight of it was dramatically different.There was a difference between a message from just the higher ups and a personal message from Hera.Hypnos\u00a0had\u00a0to execute this order, and he could not afford to fail. So he decided that he\u2019d personally make a move.At first Hypnos thought that maybe he was going a bit overboard, but\u2026\u2018It wasn\u2019t unwarranted,\u2019 he thought to himself.Within the dark, changed landscape, Hypnos watched YuWon endure his mana.Most players would have long fallen asleep already. Even fairly skilled players should have been affected by the mana and felt drowsy.But YuWon was perfectly fine, which meant it was one of two scenarios. Either YuWon\u2019s Arcane Power stat was high enough to resist his mana, or his willpower was just that amazing.Hypnos thought that the former was unlikely.\u2018His willpower is probably great,\u2019 Hypnos concluded.It was fine though. YuWon was still just a player of the lower floors. Hypnos thought that even with the penalty, there was no way YuWon would be a match for him.Fsss\u2014The mana that was dispersed into the air started to become darker in color.And finally, Hypnos\u2019s skill activated.[Dark Night]Instantly, YuWon started wobbling.Hypnos smiled. \u2018I got him,\u2019 he thought.[Dark Night] was the skill he had used the longest and the skill that got him to where he was. As a hallucination-type skill, it forced any living beings inside its reach to fall into sleep.Hypnos thought that YuWon was probably using everything he had to not fall asleep right now.\u201cIt\u2019s hard, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hypnos said, walking towards YuWon. \u201cJust give in. You can have a sweet dream if you just close your eyes.\u201dHis words were sweet. Most people gave into these words, and YuWon was no different.Ssshk\u2014YuWon\u2019s eyes slowly started to close, and he stopped wobbling.Hypnos let out a smile.YuWon fell asleep while standing.\u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 Hypnos presumed.Everyone had a desire to sleep, and Hypnos possessed the ability to draw out that desire and force people into sleep.\u2018The timing was good. Right now was the time of day when [Dark Night] exhibited the greatest power\u2026\u2019Hypnos started walking closer to YuWon.Due to releasing his mana in quite a large radius, the penalty started affecting him a little bit.It wasn\u2019t good for him to drag this out.Hypnos pulled out the dagger that he had hidden within his clothes.\u201cNo matter how good he is with the sword, he\u2019s still just a player on the lower floors,\u201d Hypnos spoke while pointing the dagger at YuWon\u2019s neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, but don\u2019t resent me too much. It\u2019s your fault for getting on the bad side of Olympus.\u201dHypnos\u2019s knife started shining.\u201cNow then, it\u2019s time to finish this\u2026\u201dSlash\u2014\u201c\u2026!\u201dHypnos took a step back, but he was a moment too late.Splurt\u2014!A deep cut ran through his chest.\u201cKgh\u2014\u201dTss, tsss\u2014The dispersed mana returned to Hypnos\u2019s body.He tried to treat his wound quickly through mana control, but the wound was too deep to treat that way.Vwoom, vwooom\u2014A dense mana was enveloping YuWon\u2019s sword.It appeared to be a pretty advanced [Arcane Sword.]Hypnos knew that it couldn\u2019t be some ordinary skill, considering it damaged the body of a Ranker like him.\u201cIt was shallow,\u201d YuWon muttered in disappointment.Lightly swinging his sword to shake the blood off the blade, he looked completely fine and awake, even just that moment ago.\u201cYou bastard\u2026\u201d Hypnos grit his teeth. \u201cWas that all an act?\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t answer his question, which Hypnos took as a silent admission.It was obvious that it was an act. If YuWon had fallen to Hypnos\u2019s skill, he wouldn\u2019t have even been able to swing his sword.From the beginning, YuWon was aiming to close the distance between them to get a one-shot.\u201cSuch a cowardly act\u2026\u201d Hypnos accused him.YuWon retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any position to speak.\u201dThat shut Hypnos up because he was right. No matter how talented YuWon was, he was still a player that had just arrived on the 11th Floor. On the other hand, Hypnos was a Ranker with the giant Olympus Guild backing him. On top of that, he was the test examiner that was in charge of making sure this test was operating fairly.There was no need to measure who was more underhanded.\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Hypnos grunted, his hand pressed tight to his wound. \u201cYou\u2019re still just a player. The results aren\u2019t going to change.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon said while looking around.His surroundings were still dark thanks to the effect of [Dark Night.]YUWon continued, \u201cThis does change things.\u201dFss, fsss\u2014Black mana started flowing out of the sword in YuWon\u2019s hand. The flow of mana was ominous. It was the dark-attribute mana from the \u300cEdge of Nightfall.\u300d[Affected by the Skill \u2013 Dark Night, your stamina recovery improves.][Stamina recovery speed: +200%.][Affected by the Skill \u2013 Dark Night, your mana recovery improves.][Mana recovery speed: +100%.][Affected by the Skill \u2013 Dark Night, your mana amplification improves.][Mana amplification: +100%.]The night didn\u2019t just belong to Hypnos.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75YuWon loved the sensation of mana overflowing in his body.\u2018That\u2019s the shit,\u2019 he thought to himself.His grip on his sword strengthened.\u300cEdge of Nightfall\u300d was no perfect sword. It had the restriction that it could only exhibit it\u2019s full power in \u2018night\u2019 or \u2018darkness.\u2019 That was a huge negative.But right now, not only was it night, but Hypnos\u2019s skill was creating a near-perfect darkness. And in a situation like this\u2026\u2018It\u2019s the perfect item.\u2019Hephaestus\u2019s ability felt truly great in this moment for YuWon.\u201cFuuu\u2014\u201dYuWon controlled his breathing while sharpening his senses. He might have been able to injure him, but his opponent was still a Ranker. He couldn\u2019t afford to be relaxed.\u2018Hypnos is a Ranker that specializes in illusions.\u2019Fortunately, YuWon already knew a bit about Hypnos.\u2018His battle position is a close-range mage, and he utilizes dark attribute mana, ideal for illusion-type skills.\u2019Fzzzt\u2014!YuWon\u2019s eyes had a glow in them. He could feel the overflowing power of the [Holy Fire] and the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d\u2018I\u2019m confident against guys like him.\u2019Crack, crack\u2014Both of YuWon\u2019s arms started to inflate from activating [Gigantification,] and the [Holy Fire] wrapped around his sword.Fsss, fss\u2014Hypnos\u2019s mana that was spread out around the area started to move.Tmp\u2014The distance between the two people shortened.YuWon and Hypnos. Their fighting styles differed, but they both liked to have a similar distance between themselves and their opponent.Whoosh\u2014!Hypnos\u2019s sharp blade flew towards him. It moved fast and sharp, but YuWon didn\u2019t let the image fool him.Shatter\u2014!Hypnos\u2019s mirage disappeared, and another Hypnos popped up right beside him. It was just another illusion. YuWon was able to see through all of Hypnos\u2019s illusions with [Cinder Eyes.]Whoosh\u2014Clang\u2014!Vwoom, vwoooooom\u2014The two blades clashed, and two different black-colored manas rippled throughout the area.YuWon\u2019s sword was not pushed back by Hypnos. There was a difference in the sizes of their swords, but Hypnos still couldn\u2019t believe what was happening.Whoosh, whoosh\u2014!The purple [Holy Fire] raged on, threatening Hypnos.Hypnos sliced the fire, and it was swallowed by his darkness.Every time the fire got close to him, a mysterious fear crept up on him.\u2018What is this skill?\u2019 Hypnos wondered.This eerie feeling was there the first time he saw YuWon\u2019s fire. He had never seen a fire that was purple before, and for some reason, when he looked at it, it felt instinctively repulsive to him.But as his repulsion and fear increased, the fire burned hotter.\u2018No.\u2019 Hypnos soon realized the true nature of YuWon\u2019s fire. \u2018It\u2019s not actually growing hotter.\u2019Hypnos stretched out his hand and snatched up the fire that was flying in midair.With the ability to turn dreams into reality, Hypnos was able to grab things that didn\u2019t have a physical form.Fwoosh, woosh\u2014The hand that he had grabbed the fire with felt hot, but it wasn\u2019t as hot as before.\u2018It just feels hot.\u2019It was a bizarre skill.Hypnos was shocked that it was able to provoke an opponent\u2019s fear and change in power proportionally to their emotions.\u201cHow troublesome,\u201d Hypnos said, shaking his hand.Vzzt, vzzzt\u2014Sparks flew around him. It was a sign that the penalty was starting and a testament to how much power he had used.Fwoosh\u2014!The [Holy Fire] was pushed aside in multiple directions. It was as if a huge hole was being opened up.YuWon hesitated for a second before swinging his sword.Vzzzt\u2014!Mana exploded out of the \u300cDark Divine Crystal,\u300d adding power to the sword.With no more reason to pay attention to the [Holy Fire,] Hypnos focused his attention on YuWon.Cling, clang, clang\u2014!As the swords struck each other and slashed through the air, countless sword marks made imprints on the ground.The two had now traded dozens of blows, and as more time passed, Hypnos became more and more impressed. \u2018This is unprecedented talent,\u2019 he thought.At first Hypnos had brushed him off, thinking, \u2018How great can a player on the 11th Floor be?\u2019 But that preconceived notion had now been smashed.A player on the lower floors could never beat a Ranker. That was a long-standing, unchangeable law.Every once in a while, among the elite Pure-Bloods were ones with great talent who managed to surpass Rankers before they became a Ranker themselves. However, that always happened after they had climbed pretty far up the Tower.\u2018If he were to become a Ranker in the future\u2026\u2019Hypnos couldn\u2019t begin to imagine what kind of a monster YuWon would be.\u2018I can\u2019t let that happen.\u2019Hypnos finally understood why Hera cared about a lowly player.\u2018I have to kill him here,\u2019 Hypnos resolved himself.[Moon Dream]Vzzzzt\u2014The penalty on Hypnos\u2019s body grew stronger.At the same time, a huge circle floated above their dark arena. It was as if a full moon was up alone in the night sky.Crack, crack\u2014The moon started to rupture\u2026Kaboom\u2014!\u2026 And it exploded.Shattered fragments of the moon started raining down with nowhere to escape.\u201cI guess you\u2019re not afraid of the Administrator,\u201d YuWon stated.His words made Hypnos pause for a second. Even Hypnos\u2019s turbulent mana froze momentarily.But soon after, Hypnos bit his lip and responded, \u201cMy only allegiance is to Olympus.\u201d\u201cWhat a joke.\u201d\u201cSay whatever you want.\u201dRumble, rumble\u2014The sky and the ground shook.\u201cThere\u2019s no way a brat that knows nothing like you would understand the greater cause.\u201d\u201c\u2018Greater cause,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201d YuWon muttered while watching the fragments of the moon coming at him.\u201cKeep this in mind.\u201dYuWon remembered what Chronos said when he first revealed the \u300cClock Movement.\u300d\u201cWhoever is the one that uses this to go back in time\u2026\u201d Chronos said while everyone was gathered around. \u201cThey will have to carry the entire Tower on their back.\u201dThe Tower was a collection of hundreds of different worlds. It was a world with trillions of living beings, and that world was on a trajectory heading towards doom.YuWon knew the end of the world.\u201cSo the one who goes back needs to be capable of holding up that weight.\u201dYuWon only understood after coming back how truly heavy it was.There was no way for Hypnos to know the magnitude of the weight on YuWon\u2019s back.\u201cI may not, but I at least know one thing,\u201d YuWon said to Hypnos.The greater cause. That wasn\u2019t something one should easily say. Not only was it embarrassing to say, but one needed the responsibility and right to be able to say it unabashedly.YuWon didn\u2019t truly know what it meant either, but he was sure of one thing.\u201cThe thing about the greater cause,\u201d YuWon snickered at Hypnos, \u201cis that it\u2019s meant to be said when you\u2019re sacrificing yourself, not someone else.\u201dLike Yuwon, who had gone back in time just to repeat that hellish fight once again.\u201cThat\u2019s cooler, isn\u2019t it?\u201d YuWon asked.Between the two of them, YuWon had the greater right to talk about it.Rumble\u2014Boom, crash\u2014!Crush\u2014!The fragments of the broken moon covered the ground.As YuWon was squashed under the pile of rocks, the ground underneath buckled, unable to handle the weight.* * *The user of the skill, Hypnos, was fine because none of the moon fragments fell around him.YuWon was now buried somewhere underneath the mountain of rocks.\u201c\u2018Cooler\u2019?\u201d Hypnos said bitterly. \u201cHow dare you say that when you don\u2019t even understand Olympus\u2019s will\u2026\u201dHypnos clenched his fist tight.He was well aware that what he was doing right now was one of the unforgivable crimes in the Tower, but he had no choice.\u2018Everything is for Olympus,\u2019 Hypnos closed his eyes and repeated the same thing over and over in his head. \u2018For Olympus\u2026\u2019Pshk\u2014A hot sensation pierced through his back and chest.Hypnos looked down and saw a black sword drenched in blood.\u201cKgh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou should never let your guard down in a fight,\u201d YuWon said while pushing up on his sword.Hypnos grabbed the blade with his hand, using sheer force to barely stop his body from getting cut in half.However, he was unable to do anything about his hand getting torn apart by the blade.\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dFwoosh\u2014!Along with incurring a powerful penalty, mana flowed out of Hypnos\u2019s body.This mana was threatening enough for YuWon to pull the sword out of Hypnos\u2019s back and jump back a distance.Fsss, fss\u2014The fragments of the moon around the place slowly started disappearing.As the scenery returned to normal, Hypnos had a shocked look on his face.\u2018H-How\u2026?!\u2019 he thought.[Moon Dream] was the strongest skill he had that he used in combination with [Dark Night.] It was a cheat-like skill capable of turning illusions into reality within the area of his mana.Moon Dream showed illusions of Hypnos\u2019s choice to his opponent. Even if his opponents suspected it of being an illusion, it was hard for them to be certain that the rocks falling right in front of them weren\u2019t real. That was the power of visions. The ability to inspire fear in someone, even if they knew that it was fake.And [Moon Dream] had the power to change that fear into reality.Two conditions were needed to nullify the skill. The first was to realize that the sight in front of them was an illusion. The second was to not feel even an inkling of fear after seeing the fragments of moon fall on them.If one doubted whether it was real or not for even a second, the illusion became reality.\u201cIs it because of those eyes?\u201d Hypnos asked, staring at YuWon.YuWon\u2019s eyes were red. Hypnos sensed a peculiar flow of mana around them.At first he didn\u2019t care since there were many eye-related skills, but it seemed that this was no ordinary skill.\u201cThey are pretty good eyes,\u201d YuWon didn\u2019t deny it.In this fight, YuWon had focused his energy into [Cinder Eyes] more than anything. He already knew how Hypnos fought, so it was a matter of seeing through his illusions. Hypnos\u2019s skill mixed reality and illusions, so it was critical to discern what was real or not.\u2018There\u2019s nothing better than the Golden Cinder Eyes for that,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.[Cinder Eyes] was not a perfect skill. As it wasn\u2019t completed into the [Golden Cinder Eyes] yet, its effects were still half-baked.Despite that, [Cinder Eyes] was the best counter-skill to illusion-type skills. The reason why YuWon was confident in this fight was all thanks to [Cinder Eyes.]\u201cIt\u2019s not over yet,\u201d Hypnos said, clasping his wound and walking towards YuWon. \u201cIf illusion-type skills don\u2019t work, I\u2019ll use another method\u2014!\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon cut him off, putting down his bloody sword. \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hypnos said in confusion.He knew that he wasn\u2019t in a great state, but for YuWon to lower his guard so much\u2026On top of that, YuWon started to calm his fighting spirit.\u2018Is he trying to catch me off guard again?\u2019 Hypnos wondered.However, Hypnos was no longer going to underestimate YuWon. YuWon had exhibited far too great a strength for him to do that anymore.Clench\u2014Hypnos\u2019s eyes glared while he gripped his dagger tight.\u2018I will slit his throat this time,\u2019 Hypnos thought to himself.Vzzzzt\u2014Penalty overflowed from Hypnos\u2019s body.Hypnos had no intention of going easy anymore since he now knew YuWon could see through his illusions.However\u2026 he could not move his dagger, as if a powerful force had taken hold of his weapon.\u201cBehind you,\u201d YuWon said while smiling. \u201cLook who\u2019s here.\u201dCold sweat started gathering on Hypnos\u2019s forehead.He didn\u2019t have to be told to know who would have arrived at a moment like now.Hypnos carefully turned his head around to see a mean-faced, red-skinned, giant man.\u201cSir\u2026\u201d Hypnos trailed off.It was the 11th Floor\u2019s Administrator who had given Hypnos his position as the test examiner.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Chapter 76Shatter\u2014!Fragments flew into Hypnos\u2019s face as the dagger broke.Hypnos blinked, and the Administrator was a step closer to him.\u201c\u25b7 Explain this,\u201d\u00a0the Administrator demanded.Hypnos felt like his entire body was being squashed. The inside of his mouth felt dry, and a cold sweat ran down his forehead.He turned his gaze to YuWon and saw that YuWon was watching him with his arms crossed.YuWon was a participant in this test. It was obvious who the Administrator would side with in this situation.\u201cSir, the thing is\u2026\u201d Hypnos tried to make an excuse but couldn\u2019t come up with anything.As he trailed off, Hypnos turned his entire body towards the Administrator and got on his knees.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Sir!\u201d Hypnos bowed down his head.It was likely that the Administrator already knew the full situation, seeing how he bothered to show up in person.Hypnos had used his powers to the limit that the penalty allowed, so it would have been strange if the Administrator was unaware of the situation.This all happened because the fight dragged on longer than he had expected.\u201c\u25b7 So at least you\u2019re sorry,\u201d\u00a0The Administrator said.\u201cI committed a grave sin, sir.\u201d\u201c\u25b7 Was this an order from Olympus?\u201dHypnos was startled by what the Administrator asked.The Administrator nodded his head after seeing his reaction.\u201c\u25b7 So I\u2019m right. Under whose order was it? Ares? Hera? Or Zeus?\u201dHypnos shouted, \u201cIt was my own\u2014!\u201d But he then quickly lowered his voice after realizing he shouted unconsciously, \u201c\u2014decision.\u201d\u201c\u25b7This was your own decision?\u201d\u00a0the Administrator scoffed. It was a lie that even an idiot wouldn\u2019t believe.\u00a0\u201cSo you want to take the blame?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not it, sir\u2026\u201d\u201c\u25b7 But even if that really were the case, Olympus can\u2019t escape all of the blame.\u201dThe Administrator\u2019s words shocked Hypnos.His loyalty to Olympus was great, to a point that he had already put his life on the line by personally going after a test participant. But by no means did he ever intend to bring harm to Olympus.\u201c\u25b7 Effective immediately, your position as the test examiner will be revoked. And I shall also be taking away all authority given to Olympus on the 11th Floor,\u201d\u00a0the Administrator said in a firm voice.\u201cS-Sir!\u201d Hypnos tried to make a rebuttal.\u201c\u25b7 How dare you raise your voice?!\u201d\u00a0the Administrator shouted at him.Thud\u2014!Hypnos, who was trying to stand up, had his body crushed back down, his face getting firmly pressed into the ground.\u201cKugh\u2014\u201d Hypnos grunted in pain.\u201c\u25b7 Of course, it won\u2019t end with just taking your position as a test examiner. Messing with a test participant as an examiner is an unforgivable crime. You will be punished for thousands of years, in a state between life and death.\u201dThe test examiner was an important job. They managed floors\u2019 tests and weeded out any cheating. Because of the importance of the job, test examiners were given huge influence and authority inside the Tower.\u201c\u25b7 We\u2019ll talk more later, Hypnos,\u201d\u00a0said the Administrator.Fwoosh\u2014Hypnos\u2019s body began to get sucked into the ground. He glared at YuWon while he disappeared.Once that was over, the Administrator turned his gaze to YuWon.\u201c\u25b7 So it\u2019s you again.\u201dThis Administrator already knew YuWon. That wasn\u2019t that big of a surprise.Administrators were beings that were hard to meet, yet YuWon was meeting his third Administrator, and each time had involved a situation that was out of the ordinary.\u201c\u25b7 Your name\u2019s Kim YuWon, isn\u2019t it? You really aren\u2019t an ordinary kid.\u201d\u201cThanks to you, I had quite a few troubles,\u201d YuWon responded while looking over at the spot where Hypnos disappeared.The Administrator instantly understood what YuWon meant.\u201c\u25b7 Definitely not ordinary,\u201d\u00a0he smirked.YuWon nodded his head.Administrators were terrifying beings. With power that matched the top High Rankers, they had the ability to use the Administrator\u2019s Authority, which let them control a floor of the Tower. And in contrast to how the Rankers were spread out throughout various guilds, Administrators were consolidated.In other words, they were the rulers of this Tower. However\u2026\u2018That doesn\u2019t mean I have to be afraid right now,\u2019 YuWon thought.Administrator\u2019s were different from Olympus. They didn\u2019t have personal feelings or goals that defied the will of the world.As long as you didn\u2019t go against the law of the world, there was no reason to fear Administrators.\u201cThere have been quite a few oddities in this test, and if I\u2019m not mistaken, a test examiner is the proxy of the Administrator,\u201d YuWon made his case.\u201c\u25b7 So you want me to take responsibility?\u201d\u201cSomeone has to.\u201dThe Administrator stared silently at YuWon.YuWon didn\u2019t avoid the Administrator\u2019s gaze because he knew that the Administrator wouldn\u2019t do anything to him in this situation since he was the victim here.\u201c\u25b7 You\u2019re not wrong,\u201d\u00a0the Administrator said with a look of amusement on his face.The events that had happened today were certainly something a test participant should never have had to go through. And with the intervention of a test examiner, the test difficulty had increased immensely.\u201c\u25b7 Okay. I promise to give you a reward when the test is over.\u201d\u201cAnd you won\u2019t go back on your words?\u201d\u201c\u25b7 I\u2019m an Administrator. You shouldn\u2019t compare me with a bastard like Hypnos.\u201dAn Administrator\u2019s words were trustworthy as they were essentially the living, breathing system. Because of that, they would never do something like lying.\u201cI understand,\u201d YuWon said. Having received the answer he wanted from the Administrator, he turned his attention. \u201cNow then\u2026\u201dThere were a few players watching what was going on.\u2018NamGung Hoon,\u2019 YuWon noticed in particular.Hoon was the successor of the NamGung Clan and a player that was expected to become a future High Ranker. And with the NamGung Clan backing him, his influence was greater than the average Ranker.\u201c\u25b7 So we had quite the audience,\u201d\u00a0the Administrator said, shrugging it off and pretending that he wasn\u2019t aware.\u00a0\u201cA big wave is coming. A big wave. Hahahah!\u201dThe Administrator put his hands behind his back and started walking away. The space in front of him tore apart, and he disappeared in an instant.Having been spectating for a while, Hoon and his companions were startled by the sudden disappearance of the Administrator,\u2018\u2018A wave,\u2019 he says\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought as he locked eyes with Hoon. \u2018I wonder\u2026\u2019Hoon had had his suspicions while following the \u2018king,\u2019 whose identity was unknown.A test examiner Ranker going after a test participant player was the worst possible crime one could commit because it broke the laws of the Tower.\u201cSo it was true,\u201d Hoon said with a serious look on his face after he got the explanation of the situation from YuWon. \u201cOlympus\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is a massive incident.\u201d\u201cAre we sure it wasn\u2019t the independent actions of the examiner?\u201d\u201cWhy would a test examiner do this on their own? It\u2019s definitely connected to the higher-ups.\u201d\u201cFucking hell\u2026\u201d\u201cShould we remain silent about this?\u201d\u201cYou think Hoon\u2019s personality would allow that?\u201d Hoon\u2019s teammate said while being conscious of him, but it was also something they all agreed on.Having witnessed this incident, their hands were tied.Olympus had committed a grave, forbidden crime. And if this incident became public, Olympus would take a massive hit.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cDid it really happen?\u201d\u201cHis opponent was a Ranker!\u201d\u201cAnd one who\u2019s powerful enough to be a test examiner\u2026\u201dHoon\u2019s teammates glanced over at YuWon.Fighting a Ranker. That was a pipe dream for players on the lower floors because their ultimate goal for climbing the Tower was to become a Ranker. This was especially true for Pure-Blooded players, so to players like Hoon, this incident hit especially big.\u2018It\u2019s the first time since \u2018The Great Sage,\u2019\u2019 Hoon thought to himself.This wasn\u2019t the first time a Ranker had lost to a player. Son OhGong, a current top High Ranker who was also known as \u201cThe Great Sage, Heaven\u2019s Equal\u201d had a record of crushing a Ranker as a player. OhGong\u2019s value as a player peaked when that incident became publicly known.\u2018The test examiner of this floor is an Olympian Ranker,\u2019 Hoon continued to assess the situation.When this event became known, it would have an even bigger ripple than OhGong\u2019s incident.\u2018What to do\u2026\u2019 he wondered.At the end of the day, they were witnesses of this incident. As such, they had two options\u2014they could either stay silent or reveal what happened.There was no particular reason to pick the latter. Even with his clan backing him, Olympus was a mighty force against Hoon. And in the worst case scenario, if the relationship between Olympus and the NamGung clan were to go south, the world of the 10th Floor, the Martial Realm, would fall into chaos.\u2018Even without us doing anything, Olympus will face repercussions.\u2019The actions of an Olympian test examiner were going to affect all of Olympus. They would lose all their influence on the 11th Floor, and Administrators of other floors would start being wary of Olympus as well.It was clear that, starting immediately, Olympus would go on red alert.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hoon finally decided to ask Yuwon after thinking for a long time, \u201cWhat will you do?\u201dYuWon had already crossed a line he couldn\u2019t come back from with Olympus.Hoon didn\u2019t know why Olympus was aiming for YuWon, but it was obvious that YuWon would be marked as their enemy due to this incident.It was an impossible task for a single person to go against Olympus. Despite that\u2026\u201cI will fight,\u201d YuWon responded.His answer was beyond what Hoon considered logical.YuWon continued, \u201cUntil I drag Zeus down to the bottom.\u201dZeus. One of the rulers of the Tower and the great King of Olympus.As soon as Zeus\u2019s name was mentioned, Hoon felt his chest tighten. YuWon said the name of that giant way too easily.Hoon had to ask, \u201cHow did you become enemies with Olympus? What in the world happened?\u201d\u201cI helped a blacksmith who was being forced to make weapons he didn\u2019t want to.\u201d YuWon was speaking about Hephaestus. \u201cEver since then, they decided they wanted to kill me.\u201d\u201cA blacksmith, you say\u2026\u201d Hoon muttered.Hoon was a direct descendent of the NamGung Clan. Because of that, he endlessly heard news around the Tower.Even though YuWon wasn\u2019t clear, Hoon was somewhat able to put together what was going on.\u201cI see,\u201d Hoon said while nodding.He then turned around and started walking away.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHey, Hoon! Where are you going?\u201dHis teammates started chasing after him.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for the Grand Martial Arts Tournament,\u201d Hoon responded to them while taking out his player kit. \u201cWe\u2019re returning to the NamGung Clan.\u201dHe messaged his father, the head of the NamGung Clan and the guildmaster of the Martial Guild, NamGung JinWoon.* * *Afterwards, the 11th Floor\u2019s test continued under the supervision of the Administrator.There was nothing to stop YuWon now.The majority of the players on Team B had forfeited from the test. So YuWon went around taking flags from the remaining Team B players and finding flags around the forest.Time passed, and the 24 hours were close to coming to an end.\u201cI really thought I was going to die,\u201d Halimun said to YuWon.After seeing YuWon, his legs gave out, and he fell to the ground.He was surrounded by blood, but none of it belonged to Halimun. Rather, it was the blood of players from Team B who had wanted to kill Halimun to win the test. All those players had been forced to run away while spilling their blood, unable to achieve their goal.\u201cBut you didn\u2019t,\u201d YuWon answered nonchalantly.Halimun shook his head, having experienced what felt like an eternal hell. Multiple times, he had thought about giving up on the test.\u201cYou did good holding out and not giving up,\u201d YuWon complimented him.Halimun lifted his head upon hearing that, noticing a red flag.It was all the flags YuWon had gathered so far.[618]That was the number on the flag.Five or ten flags would already have been a lot, but here was someone who had managed to gather over 600 flags by himself.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201d Halimun laughed in disbelief. Many thoughts were running through his head.The test was almost over, and with so many flags, he would be able to receive a tremendous amount of CP, which meant a big reward.But right now, Halimun wasn\u2019t laughing because of that.\u2018I did it,\u2019 Halimun thought. He was happy and proud from receiving a compliment from YuWon and that he\u2019d managed to endure it without giving up. \u2018I did it\u2026\u2019Halimun\u2019s hand shook while reaching for the flag.That was right. He did it. He completed the role of \u2018king\u2019 by not giving up and surviving. Even if it was 90% thanks to YuWon\u2026 he had done it.Halimun was Team A\u2019s \u2018king\u2019 who had managed to win the 11th Floor\u2019s test with YuWon.[You obtained 618 flags.][You obtained 6180cp.]As soon as YuWon handed over the flag to Halimun, both of them got the same message.And a moment later\u2026[The test has ended.][Team A: 623 flags][Team B: 2 flags][The winner is Team A.][You may now use the CP shop.][You have obtained the right to move on to the 12th Floor.][You are now able to teleport to the next floor.][The 11th Floor\u2019s ranking has been updated.][1st: 22,360cp]Messages were popping up for players that had participated in the 11th Floor\u2019s test.The test was now over.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77Chapter 77[1st \u2013 Kim YuWon : 22,360cp][2nd \u2013 Zeus : 8,860cp][3rd \u2013 Hercules : 8,540cp][4th \u2013 Odin : 8,020cp][\u2026\u2026][36th \u2013 Halimun : 6,230cp]A new record was set once again on the 11th Floor.A player who managed to break the record of Zeus, a High Ranker and King of Olympus, had appeared .\u2018So he got 36th place.\u2019Halimun, who passed the test with YuWon, ended up with a pretty high ranking. It was thanks to the five flags he had on-hand and the 600 flags he got from YuWon, netting him over 6,000cp.It was a pretty incredible record since 36th put him above most High Rankers.\u2018As for Hargaan\u2026\u2019YuWon skimmed over the new 11th Floor rankings. There were quite a few familiar names.OhGong was ranked 11th, which was pretty low considering his skills. But that was because he wasn\u2019t suited for team-based tests like this. Odin was 4th, and Hercules was 3rd.Then he spotted another familiar name that popped out to him.[6th \u2013 Hargaan : 7,860cp]There wasn\u2019t a big gap between 4th and 6th place. It was close enough where Hargaan could have gotten 4th if he had obtained just a few more flags.\u2018That\u2019s impressive.\u2019YuWon saw Hargaan\u2019s records here and there. Hargaan was steadily raising his rankings while climbing the Tower, and now finally on the 11th Floor, he got a result that matched the great beings of the Tower.\u2018He\u2019s certainly changed.\u2019Hargaan was originally brimming with talent. What changed was the Tutorial and his meeting with YuWon.YuWon had no way to know what kind of a stimulus he provided to Hargaan, but it was a fact that he had essentially given a tiger wings with the Tutorial\u2019s reward. And right now, Hargaan was using those wings to climb the Tower with better results.\u201cI wonder.\u201dAfter checking the rankings, YuWon took a look at his contribution points again. A CP of over 20,000.This was a number YuWon had not expected.He would have been satisfied just getting over 10,000cp, yet he had scored double that amount.This was because of one reason.[You have been awarded additional CP for an unknown reason.][You have obtained 10,000cp.]This was a message that only YuWon got. It was likely YuWon\u2019s special reward for defeating Hypnos.The Administrator had kept his promise.10,000cp alone was enough to top the rankings.It wasn\u2019t as big of a reward as he had expected, but YuWon had no complaints.* * *As soon as he arrived on the 12th Floor, YuWon immediately found himself lodgings for a hefty price.\u201cThis was the last one left. You got lucky,\u201d the owner of the inn told him.It was a hefty price of 20 points for a single night in a tiny 16m2* room.*PR/N:\u00a0\u2248172ft2The world of the 12th Floor was a singular small city. Because there was so little land, lodging was expensive, and it was hard to obtain food. This made the 12th Floor the worst possible place for players to stay.\u2018There\u2019s not even anything to do here.\u2019There were no dungeons and very few facilities.YuWon unpacked his belongings inside his small room, and then\u2026\u201cLackey.\u201d\u201c> Yes. Did you call for me?\u201dA small fairy appeared like it had been waiting. Its eyes sparkled with great expectation.That wasn\u2019t a surprise. Any Lackey would be interested in YuWon with how many points and CP he had.If YuWon didn\u2019t call for the Lackey, it might have even shown up without being called.\u201cI want to use the Shop,\u201d YuWon requested.\u201c> Which shop? The Point Shop? Or the CP Shop?\u201d\u201cThe CP Shop. This is the only place I can use my CP anyway,\u201d YuWon answered.The CP earned on the 11th Floor acted similarly to points. The 11th Floor\u2019s test didn\u2019t directly reward you with points but instead gave you CP, a much more valuable currency.And this CP was usable in the CP Shop on the 12th Floor.\u201c> Okay. CP Shop, coming right up!\u201dDing\u2014A shop opened in front of YuWon\u2019s eyes.The 11th\u2019s Floor reward was special because you could \u2018select\u2019 your reward with CP, which was very different from rewards from other floors.There was such a wide variety to select from that it surprised even YuWon.\u2018So they even have stuff like this,\u2019 he thought.There were quite a few items and skills with a price tag of over 10,000cp that YuWon wanted.The CP Shop had a fundamental difference from a normal Point Shop. Normal Point Shops showed all items and skills on sale, but the CP Shop only displayed things that the player could purchase with their CP.No one knew such items were sold in the CP Shop because no player had obtained over 10,000cp before.\u201cWhat the hell?\u201dThe higher the price tag went up, the better the items got exponentially. Around the 20,000cp mark, there were skills for sale that shocked even YuWon. This was certainly a happy problem to have, but no matter what he chose, he would feel like he missed out.But he had to make a choice.\u2018I was wondering where this went\u2026\u2019It was an item that YuWon was looking for.\u2018So it was here.\u2019It ended up not being a difficult choice. There were other items and skills he wanted, but it was possible to find substitutes for those. However, this item was irreplaceable.\u201cI\u2019ll go with this.\u201d[You consumed 22,000cp.]* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases! https://discord.gg/MaRegMFhRb* * *The NamGung Clan was the second largest organization in the Martial Realm after the Heavenly Demonic Cult, and it was the center of the 10th Floor\u2019s world that lead the Martial Guild. Not to mention, it was an elite clan that produced many Rankers and High Rankers.\u201cSo you\u2019re back,\u201d a man greeted Hoon\u2019s arrival.Step, step\u2014Hoon walked towards him.It was his father, NamGung JinWoon.JinWoon had a beard that was a few inches long, sharp looking eyes, and a body that didn\u2019t age.He was Hoon\u2019s father and the man that turned the NamGung Clan, which was on the brink of ruin long ago, into the main pillar of the Martial Realm.\u201cYou returned early,\u201d JinWoon said from amidst a mountain of documents.It was an image that didn\u2019t fit a man who had wielded a sword his entire life, but as time passed, he had to spend more and more days looking through papers. This was a natural result of the NamGung Clan\u2019s power and influence having grown so large.\u201cIsn\u2019t there a lot of time left until the Grand Martial Arts Tournament?\u201d JinWoon asked Hoon.\u201cI have something I need to tell you, father.\u201d\u201cYou could have used your kit to contact me.\u201d\u201cI decided it would be best that we leave no records of this conversation.\u201dThe player kit wasn\u2019t omnipotent. Though rare, there were players and Rankers who would hack another player\u2019s kit and check their records.And the security of this information was crucial in this matter.JinWoon raised his head from the pile of documents and looked over at his son.\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he told Hoon.\u201cOlympus is making a move.\u201d\u201cThose guys are always on the move.\u201d\u201cI think they found Hephaestus.\u201dJinWoon\u2019s hand paused while reaching for his cooled cup of tea, and he stared at Hoon, signaling him to keep talking.Hoon continued, \u201cThey\u2019re preparing for the Gigantomachy.\u201d\u201cThe Gigantomachy, you say\u2026\u201dInstead of drinking his tea, JinWoon tapped his teacup with his finger.He was reminded of an unpleasant memory. It was a tragedy that all the olden Rankers remembered, and the only ones in this Tower who remembered that tragedy fondly were from Olympus.\u201cWhere did this information come from?\u201d\u201cI heard it from Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cKim YuWon. I\u2019ve heard his name before.\u201dYuWon\u2019s name was pretty famous in the Martial Realm. Rankers were already starting to learn of YuWon\u2019s name, but the biggest reason for his fame in the Martial Realm was that he had passed the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.For JinWoon who knew the Heavenly Demonic Cult and the Heavenly Demon, he couldn\u2019t easily brush this information off.However\u2026\u201cIsn\u2019t he still just a player? How does he know such information?\u201d JinWoon asked.Regardless of his fame, YuWon was too small compared to Olympus. A lowly player.And that preconceived notion was something that was hard to break out of without seeing him in action in person.\u201cOlympus is aiming for Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018aiming for\u2019?\u201d\u201cThe truth is\u2026\u201d Hoon told his father the events that had unfolded on the 11th Floor.JinWoon\u2019s eyebrows furrowed.It was a story that was hard to believe\u2026 But it wasn\u2019t like he could refuse to believe his son\u2019s words.\u201cHe has been fighting Olympus for a while now,\u201d said Hoon.\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d JinWoon let out a faint grunt.A player that was still far from becoming a Ranker was fighting the giant that was Olympus by himself.JinWoon felt his chest ache.\u201cWho else knows about this?\u201d\u201cEveryone in my team.\u201d\u201cAnd your team has Gibbons, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll only be a matter of time until Asgard also knows.\u201dGibbons was a player who was sponsored by Asgard.JinWoon felt that a giant torrent was starting up.The active Olympus and the 2nd Gigantomachy.And caught in the middle was a small star that had just begun to shine.JinWoon stood up and looked out his window. He could feel how busy his clan was while preparing for the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, and he had a hunch that this tournament would be more turbulent than usual.* * *Fwoosh\u2014Smash\u2014!A fireball flew fast in a straight line and smashed the target.Embers spread out, and the crowd couldn\u2019t hold back their awe.\u201cWow\u2026\u201d\u201cHe actually hit that?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t even see it properly\u2026\u201dThe testing site quickly filled with spectators.This was a test where you had to hit 100 targets. The test lasted an hour, and the targets became faster as their numbers increased.YuWon gathered the [Holy Fire] in his hands once again.A round target appeared again, but it was much faster than the previous one.\u2018This isn\u2019t bad practice,\u2019 YuWon thought.He knew how to handle a myriad of different weapons, but he was most familiar with the sword. However, YuWon also excelled greatly in spearmanship, and throwing spears was one of YuWon\u2019s specialties.Fwoosh\u2014A spear made of fire.Because his focus was still weak, it wasn\u2019t that sharp, but despite that, it was still destructive.YuWon could see the trajectory of the flying target. And in an instant\u2026Whoosh\u2014!\u2026 The flaming spear left YuWon\u2019s hand and pierced the target.Boom\u2014![You destroyed 1,000 targets.][You passed the 19th Floor\u2019s test.][You are now able to teleport to the next floor.][You leveled up.][Your Strength increased by 1.][Your Constitution increased by 1.][Your Perception increased by 1.][You obtained 50,000 points.]Messages popped up for Yuwon, who was looking at the remains of the shattered targets.He had achieved ten times the quota required to pass, and there were still about five minutes on the clock. However, it seemed that there were no more targets left.\u2018That\u2019s stingy,\u2019 YuWon thought.This message should have been happy news, but YuWon was frowning.It was likely because there weren\u2019t any additional rewards. There were only the increase in stats from leveling and points.Also, with 100 Arcane Power so close in his reach, other stats kept increasing instead.\u2018I\u2019m slowly hitting the limit.\u2019He had reached a point where it had become harder to get stronger from just hunting and getting rewards from tests.It was a dilemma. YuWon didn\u2019t know if he should have been happy that his growth was faster than expected or if he should have felt disappointed that his growth was becoming stunted.\u2018I guess I shouldn\u2019t expect a proper reward anymore until the 20th Floor.\u2019Every 10th Floor, the tests became much harder, but they also came with proportionally great rewards. For example, he had obtained the [Holy Fire] from the Heavenly Demonic Cult on the 10th Floor.And unlike with the 10th Floor where he had gone in blind, YuWon knew what was hidden on the 20th Floor.\u2018I\u2019ll have to stop for a moment.\u2019He had now obtained the right to reside on the 20th Floor, but the 20th Floor\u2019s test was quite tricky.Well technically it was what YuWon had to do in the test that was tricky.[Arcane Power : 99]He was just one point away from 100, and he knew how to get there.The \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u300d It was one of the greatest elixirs that was only made once every three years in the Martial Realm, and it possessed a value of hundreds of thousands in points.\u201cI should start heading down.\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t head up after finishing the 19th Floor\u2019s test. Rather, he headed downwards because it was now one day before the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78The Grand Martial Arts Tournament was the biggest event in the Martial Realm, representing the 10th Floor, and it was a festival that drew the attention of countless Rankers.Whenever it got close to the tournament, the Martial City became chock full of people.\u201cThere really are a lot of people.\u201d\u201cDid you manage to find lodging?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s literally no place to stay, but even if there was, we\u2019d have to share rooms.\u201d\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I told you, we should have come sooner to secure a spot.\u201d\u201cBut coming five days before the event seems like such a waste.\u201d\u201cThe tournament isn\u2019t the only thing here. There\u2019s plenty of other sights to see. You really are stupid.\u201d\u201cSelling hot jianbing!* We also have veggie stir-fry and dumplings!\u201d*TL/N: A Chinese street food that\u2019s like a savory crepe.The streets were filled with vendors selling simple foods.People drank liquor, shared food, and debated while looking over the list of participants for the tournament.\u201cIt\u2019s gotta be Hoon. Not only is the NamGung Clan the one hosting the tournament, he\u2019s not called a genius for no reason.\u201d\u201cThe NamGung Clan ain\u2019t that great. The Martial Guild isn\u2019t even one of the major guilds.\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019ll be Hargaan then?\u201d\u201cIs he also participating in the tournament?\u201d\u201cOf course. He\u2019s the best High Pure-Blood in the last few hundred years. I heard that he made it all the way to the 25th Floor in a flash before waiting for the tournament.\u201d\u201cWhat a terrifying speed.\u201d\u201cAt that rate, he might even be able to become a Ranker in less than ten years.\u201dHargaan was one of favorites to win the Grand Martial Arts Tournament. Not only had he made it to the 25th floor, the last floor you can get to before being ineligible to participate, he had ranked highly on each floor he had passed.\u201cHey! I got a big scoop!\u201d\u201cWhat is it that it made you so late?\u201d\u201cSit down already. Could I get another aguardiente here?\u201d\u201cI\u2019d also like some more side dishes\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now!\u201d the man who had arrived late said to his group, all out of breath, \u201cKim YuWon is participating.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI thought he would have gone on to clear the next floor.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be interested in stuff like this.\u201dPlayers that participated in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament had various motives. The most common one was to show off their skills and get sponsored by the best guild possible.Countless guilds paid attention to the tournament, so if you did well in it, it was a piece of cake to get sponsored by a guild.Another common reason was to elevate the status of a guild.Players on the lower floors were essentially a guild\u2019s future. They would climb the Tower, become Rankers, and one day become a core fighting power of the guild.Also, a guild\u2019s reputation changed depending on the number of players that did well in the tournament, so many different guilds would push their players to participate. The more players of their own guild that ranked highly in the tournament, the more their reputation would increase, allowing them to expand.\u201cI doubt it\u2019s to get the attention of guilds\u2026\u201d\u201cDo you think it\u2019s for the prize?\u201d\u201cI bet he\u2019s participating, thinking he\u2019s got this in the bag.\u201dThe group of men that were eating now had a different look on their face.These Rankers didn\u2019t come all the way down to the 10th Floor just for fun.\u201cWhen was the last time we approached YuWon?\u201d the man in the center of the group asked.He was someone that didn\u2019t bother with pointless gossip, so when he spoke, the mood drastically changed.\u201cIt was after he cleared the 8th Floor.\u201d\u201cSo it\u2019s been a while.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s managed to climb to the 20th floor since then, but it actually hasn\u2019t been that long in terms of time, sir.\u201d\u201cStill.\u201d\u201cWe sent a messenger, but he didn\u2019t even bother with us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll personally go this time,\u201d said the man with a face covered in blue scales as he stood up.It was Brahnil, a Ranker belonging to the Dragon race.He said, \u201cWith the honor of our guild, the 12 Earthly Gods,* on the line.\u201d*TL/N: The 12 Earthly Gods is a reference to the 12 Chinese zodiacs.* * *\u201cGo away.\u201dThat was what Brahnil was told at the door after having jumped through various hoops trying to find where YuWon was staying.Brahnil had a blank look on his face. He couldn\u2019t believe he had been told to go away. He had thought he would get invited in for some tea and have a short talk before he was rejected.He had also wanted to take this chance to see why everyone was so desperate to recruit YuWon.So he was dumbfounded at being treated like this.\u201cAren\u2019t you quite rude?\u201d Brahnil asked.YuWon just silently pointed behind Brahnil with his chin.Brahnil looked behind him and was shocked to see a familiar face.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201d Brahnil trailed off.\u201cAren\u2019t you from the 12 Earthly Gods? I heard that things haven\u2019t been going well for you guys, but to think the guildmaster would personally come.\u201d\u201cSariel?\u201dAs a Ranker of the major guild Zion, Sariel was an archangel who was said to be on the precipice of becoming a High Ranker.Gulp\u2014A Ranker from Zion with the position of archangel had personally come to pay YuWon a visit. Normally, Zion would have just sent a player on the lower floors to recruit someone.\u2018Could it be that others are doing the same as me\u2026?\u2019 Brahnil thought.It was rare for a Ranker to personally come and make a recruitment offer, so Brahnil had intended on scooping up YuWon by getting ahead of everyone.His thought process was that no matter how great a player might be, there was no way YuWon could beat the pressure exerted by a Ranker.But Brahnil was completely wrong. This was not the first time a Ranker had personally paid YuWon a visit.YuWon had been encountering Rankers for quite a while now, even before he had stepped foot on the 10th Floor.\u201cIt\u2019s a good sight. I hope you keep up the hard work as the head of the pack,\u201d said Sariel.Brahnil bit his tongue at the back-handed compliment. Even if he was a Ranker of the Dragon race, it couldn\u2019t be helped that he felt miniscule compared to an archangel of Zion.\u201cAre you also going to tell me to go away?\u201d asked Sariel, looking back and forth between YuWon and Brahnil.Sariel decided that there was no need for a long talk. YuWon seemed very used to this situation.\u201cWell, you are my ninth and tenth visitor today,\u201d YuWon answered.\u201cI see.\u201dThough he was visited by multiple guilds, YuWon denied all of them a meeting.This was the first time a Ranker on the level of Sariel had come by, but no matter who came, YuWon had no intention of giving a different answer.\u201cWell, if you by chance have a change of heart, contact us here. Zion will always have a spot for you.\u201d\u201cI can promise you that won\u2019t happen,\u201d YuWon answered, leaving not a shred of hope.In contrast to Sariel who started leaving, Brahnil stood in place, wanting to get something out of this encounter.That was when a new visitor came by.\u201cWhat about me? Should I also go away?\u201dYuWon, who was planning on going back into his room, stopped in his tracks.His annoyance quickly left, and he felt a bit comforted after seeing who it was.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, friend,\u201d said the new visitor.\u2018H-Hargaan?\u2019 Brahnil thought.A chiseled, handsome fellow with golden blonde hair and sharp eyes. Hargaan looked exactly like he had heard.Brahnil remembered that Hargaan was a comrade that YuWon did the Tutorial together with.YuWon said, \u201cYeah. Go away.\u201d\u201cWait! Really?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m kidding. You can come in,\u201d YuWon said, going into his room without closing the door.While following YuWon, Hargaan let out a baffled laugh, \u201cYour jokes aren\u2019t funny man.\u201dSlam\u2014The door closed, and Brahnil mumbled in a daze, \u201cI should just leave\u2026\u201d* * *The inn YuWon was staying in was quite big, clocking in at about 65m2.* It was one of the best places one could get in the area.*PR/N:\u00a0\u2248\u00a0700ft2\u201cHow did you even get a place like this?\u201d\u201cBy paying a pretty penny.\u201d\u201cYou must be rich.\u201d\u201cWell, I just keep racking up points. I went through the trouble of stopping my ascension. Might as well rest in luxury.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dYuWon poured some water for Hargaan.The cold glass of water was perfect for a hot day like today.As Hargaan was about to take a drink\u2026Bang, bang\u2014\u201cIs Mr. Kim YuWon here?\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s here for you,\u201d Hargaan remarked.\u201cJust ignore it. If it\u2019s actually urgent, they\u2019ll enter by breaking down the door or something.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re real laid back. This must happen a lot.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had people visiting me regularly, but it\u2019s been especially bad here.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s probably because of the tournament. Guilds gather around this time in the Martial Realm to recruit players.\u201dYuWon nodded his head. It was annoying, but it was going to be a few days at best, and things were likely going to calm down again once he left the 10th Floor.\u201cSo how did you find me?\u201d asked Yuwon.\u201cYou\u2019re a real celebrity you know. All I had to do was ask around a bit.\u201d\u201cI would have just told you if you had asked.\u201d\u201cBut what\u2019s the fun in that? It wouldn\u2019t be a surprise visit then, would it?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t really surprise me either way.\u201dYuWon thought Hargaan would have changed a lot, but he was still the same. A laid-back personality, earnest eyes, and a confident attitude.He was one of the few \u2018real ones\u2019 that YuWon acknowledged.\u201cWhat about your teammates?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re resting at the inn. I snuck out to come see you.\u201d\u201cHas anyone died so far?\u201d\u201cNot a single one.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all going to become Rankers. They all have what it takes,\u201d Hargaan said with confidence.And his words had a level of truth to it. Some of his teammates did indeed become Rankers that YuWon knew in the future.\u2018Though I\u2019m not sure about Lee SungYoon\u2026\u2019 YuWon wondered.The one unexpected variable was SungYoon.He was a player from Earth like YuWon, and he had a great talent for mana, being able to use [Mana Blast] early on. So it was hard for YuWon to gauge how much he might have grown.\u2018I guess I can find out by seeing him in person,\u2019 YuWon decided.There was not much information known about SungYoon, and he was originally a player that should have died in the Tutorial. Maybe it was because they came from the same place, but he was the most memorable out of Hargaan\u2019s teammates to YuWon.\u201cI heard you pulled something real big this time,\u201d said Hargaan.YuWon had a confused look on his face.He wasn\u2019t pretending. He genuinely didn\u2019t know what Hargaan was talking about since it could have been a number of things.\u201cI heard you were the one that stopped Olympus from capturing Hephaestus.\u201d\u201cHow did you find that out?\u201d\u201cI might not be well-loved by my family, but my father is still Zeus. Besides, do you know how many people have become Rankers after being in my shoes?\u201dYuWon nodded his head at Hargaan\u2019s words.There were quite a handful of bastard children of Zeus. Famously, there were Apollo and Artemis, the High Rankers of Olympus. They were both illegitimate children of Zeus.\u201cI\u2019m able to get ahold of most information. Seriously. I thought you were one real crazy son of a bitch when I heard it. Tsk tsk. What were you thinking? I\u2019m impressed that you survived a fight against a Ranker, but now you\u2019ve made an enemy of Olympus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised you came here despite knowing all that.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019ve never been one to care what others think. Besides, it\u2019s Hera\u2019s faction that\u2019s all up in arms anyway.\u201dHargaan had never been on good terms with Hera and Ares, so he had decided there was no need to be careful of them.\u201cWhat about Zeus?\u201d\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re the first guy I\u2019ve ever met who says my father\u2019s name so nonchalantly.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cFather has long since stepped away from matters regarding Olympus. He\u2019s focused on clearing the next floor.\u201dThe Tower was known to have a total of 100 floors, but that wasn\u2019t actually true.People called players who climbed to the 100th Floor Rankers, but that was only because the test on the 100th Floor hadn\u2019t been cleared yet.There was a higher place in the Tower, and people referred to the place above the 100th floor as \u2018The Ceiling.\u2019\u201cAnyway, Olympus is not happy because you saved the criminal Hephaestus, so you should watch yourself for a bit. When I get a chance, I\u2019ll speak to my father and try to put in a good word for you.\u201dIt seemed that Hargaan was unaware what had happened on the 11th Floor.YuWon wasn\u2019t surprised. The fact that a test examiner had attacked a test participant would be top secret. Even Hargaan shouldn\u2019t be able to obtain such information easily.Hargaan was showing goodwill, but YuWon was still disappointed by what Hargaan had said.\u201cSo that\u2019s how you see it as well,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m talking about ahjussi. He\u2019s known as a criminal within Olympus.\u201dAfter finishing his glass of water, YuWon got up from his seat.\u201cDo you want to come with me?\u201d he asked Hargaan.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cTo the 1st Floor.\u201dYuWon had some business there, so he was going to stop by before the tournament started anyway.\u201cTo meet Hephaestus-ahjussi.\u201dThose words made the expression on Hargaan\u2019s face change.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Klang! Klang\u2014!Loud, deafening sounds of hammering echoed.A hand wielding a heavy hammer repeatedly swung it against a piece of metal. That same hand then put down the hammer and picked up a smaller hammer.Klang\u2014!The smaller hammer was then used to repeat the same task.Finally, Hephaestus stopped hammering, putting the only partially formed chunk of metal back into the furnace before taking a break.\u201cPhew\u2014\u201dHanging inside the workshop, the towel that Hephaestus grabbed to wipe the sweat off his forehead was hot and dry.He felt hot and was having a hard time breathing. It had been four days since he\u2019d been holed up in his workshop.\u2018Am I pushing myself too far?\u2019There was a mountain of commissions he had to complete.The commissioned items were all defensive gear. Armor, shields, or accessories with special skills.They were all items void of any lethality.\u201cMy hands are starting to itch.\u201dHephaestus thought back to the enormous stack of minerals in his inventory.Just off the top of his head, he could envision a number of items with over half of them being weapons. However, he was no longer making swords or spears.The only exception was the sword he had made for his savior.Step\u2014\u201cHmm?\u201dHe heard footsteps coming down to his workshop.Hephaestus, who was taking a break, got up from his seat.\u201cSo he\u2019s here.\u201dThere was only one person he knew who entered his workshop without knocking.\u00a0 Not to mention he was contacted recently through the player kit that they were stopping by.\u2018It\u2019s finished\u2026\u2019 Hephaestus thought while silently looking at the gauntlet cooling in the water, \u2018But I wonder if he\u2019ll be able to handle it.\u2019YuWon had fought against a Ranker at the start of the 1st Floor. There was no doubting his power, and by now he might actually have obtained power that rivaled Rankers.But that didn\u2019t change anything because this wasn\u2019t about if he was strong or weak. It was about if he was \u2018qualified\u2019 or not.\u201cAre you here?\u201d the visitor asked.Hephaestus asked back, \u201cAren\u2019t you supposed to ask that before you just enter?\u201dWhen he saw YuWon\u2019s face, Hephaestus had to try and act nonchalant to hide how happy he was to see him.As YuWon reached the bottom of the stairs, Hephaestus got up from his seat and saw that there was someone else behind YuWon.\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Hephaestus asked.\u201cOh, this is\u2014\u201dYuWon stopped mid-introduction, seeing that Hephaestus\u2019s face had frozen up.Hephaestus was staring at Hargaan\u2019s blonde hair.Blonde hair wasn\u2019t all that uncommon, but shimmering, golden blonde hair was.YuWon couldn\u2019t avoid Hephaestus\u2019s question. But right as he was going to answer\u2026\u201cMy name\u2019s Hargaan,\u201d Hargaan stepped forward and introduced himself.Hephaestus wore a look of disapproval. It was clear that he knew who Hargaan was.\u201cSo you\u2019re father\u2019s son,\u201d Hephaestus said.\u201cCan\u2019t you just call me your little brother?\u201d\u201cI think the fight between our siblings is a bit too intense for me to be so amicable.\u201dHephaestus turned his gaze to his hammer as he asked, \u201cSo, are you here to catch me as well?\u201d\u201cN-No. Of course not. Not to mention I lack the ability to do so,\u201d Hargaan quickly denied while waving his hands in front of him.His job might have been blacksmithing, but the man was still a Ranker. And he was no half-assed Ranker but a Ranker who climbed the Tower thousands of years ago.Hargaan might have been a player who was famed in the lower floors, but there was no way he could hold a candle to Hephaestus.\u201cThen why are you here?\u201d Hephaestus asked.\u201cI wanted to personally meet you.\u201d\u201cMe? Why?\u201d\u201cBecause I can\u2019t trust Olympus.\u201dHephaestus\u2019s eyes widened after hearing Hargaan\u2019s answer. One of Zeus\u2019s sons had said that they couldn\u2019t trust Olympus.\u201cSince I was born, I was told that you\u2026 my big brother was a criminal. Then my friend told me that he had saved you.\u201dYuWon had opened Hargaan\u2019s eyes. He had showed him that Olympus, which Hargaan thought was his entire world, wasn\u2019t perfect.That was when Hargaan resolved himself that he would believe what he saw with his own eyes over what he was simply told.\u201cI wanted to see and judge for myself. Find out for myself who big brother Hephaestus really is.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Hephaestus scratched his chin, staring at Hargaan.He saw radiant, beautiful golden hair, eyes full of confidence, and irises that were the same color as his hair.\u2018He looks similar,\u2019 Hephaestus thought.He could see in Hargaan\u2019s face the face of Olympus\u2019s King, the man he used to respect the most.Rumors traveled fast. Even Hephaestus, who cared very little about what was going on in the world, had heard Hargaan\u2019s name a few times because he was becoming more famous than your average Ranker.Hargaan had inherited more of Zeus\u2019s genes than anyone else.\u201cSo. What do you think?\u201d Hephaestus asked.Hargaan responded, \u201cI can\u2019t really figure out much from only seeing your face\u2026\u201dHis eyes then darted around the interior of the workshop, and the only things he could see were armor, shields, helmets, and the like.In a short instance, Hargaan learned a lot from looking around the workshop.\u201cIt seems that you don\u2019t make weapons,\u201d Hargaan remarked.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t always the case, right? I know of countless weapons in Olympus that you\u2019ve made.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t,\u201d Hephaestus said while looking over at the sword on YuWon\u2019s waist.It was the most recent weapon he had crafted, and he had felt so elated when making it.\u201cHow long has it been since you stopped making weapons?\u201dHargaan\u2019s question made Hephaestus close his eyes.The sudden stop to the conversation made the silence feel much longer than it was, but Hargaan didn\u2019t pressure Hephaestus to answer quickly.Various expressions came and left Hephaestus\u2019s face. He only answered after he managed to wipe the pain from his face.\u201cIt was after the Gigantomachy.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn* * *YuWon stepped outside and waited for Hargaan and Hephaestus\u2019s talk to end.The two conversed for a long time.Gigantomachy. After that word was uttered, Hargaan\u2019s heart started beating rapidly.\u201cThe weapons I made pierced the hearts of the Giants.\u201dThe Giants were one of the races that ruled the Tower, achieving that position through their natural strength and large physique.Hephaestus continued \u201cThey viewed Olympus as allies.\u201dHe then shook his head and mumbled, \u201cNo. They saw us as friends, or both actually.\u201dHephaestus raised his head and stared into Hargaan\u2019s eyes.\u201cOthers might point fingers at them for being hideous, but we shouldn\u2019t have done so. Olympus only got to where they are thanks to the Giants.\u201d\u201cSuch a thing happened?\u201d Hargaan asked.\u201cThis is a story that kids nowadays don\u2019t really know. You might know if you\u2019re an old Ranker, but young ones have probably only heard the inaccurate retelling.\u201dHephaestus pulled out the \u2018back in my day\u2019 card. As a Ranker who was thousands of years old, there was much that he knew.\u201cAnyway, when the Giants started getting ostracized, Olympus declared war against them.\u201dHargaan\u2019s brow furrowed as he asked, \u201cWhat was the reason?\u201d\u201cIt was political. Others weren\u2019t viewing them very kindly, but also by taking care of them, Olympus could take full control of the floors they shared with them.\u201d\u201cThey did that for such a petty reason?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cExcuse me?\u201d\u201cYou might think it\u2019s petty, but most people don\u2019t see it that way,\u201d Hephaestus mumbled, \u201cincluding our father.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd the war that we waged against the Giants was the Gigantomachy. It involved Asgardian Giants, Olympian Giants, and Rankers from various guilds who wanted the rights we were fighting over. The war continued to get bigger, and the weapons I made ended up taking the lives of my friends.\u201dYuWon, who had been eavesdropping, lowered his head.This was the second time he had heard this story, and because Hephaestus was even closer to YuWon back then, Hephaestus had shown his vulnerability. Hephaestus had let out massive sobs while he told YuWon about the past.YuWon was certain that Hephaestus was feeling just as torn up right now as back then, but Hephaestus was probably holding back his tears as hard as he could to save face.\u201cThey were sacrificed for Olympus to increase their influence and to wash off the dishonor that Olympus was once an ally of the Giants,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd was that when\u2026 When I stopped doing anything for Olympus and also when I stopped making weapons.\u201dGrit\u2014Instead of crying, Hephaestus clenched his teeth and showed anger.\u201cBut then a few decades ago, they suddenly asked me to make weapons again.\u201dHargaan caught on quickly.\u201cAre they\u2026?\u201d\u201cThere are still Giants left.\u201d\u201cSo will the Gigantomachy be happening again?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re probably still only in the planning stage, but it\u2019s highly likely,\u201d he couldn\u2019t deny the possibility.Hephaestus was the greatest blacksmith in the Tower. The weapons he made made a bigger impact the larger the war was.There was a reason why some people say that Hephaestus was one of the people that made Olympus into what it was today.As such, preparing for the next Gigantomachy was a possible reason why Olympus was hellbent on capturing Hephaestus.\u201cIt\u2019s your choice which side you want to believe. It\u2019s entirely possible that I\u2019m lying,\u201d Hephaestus said while getting up. He didn\u2019t have much more to say. \u201cI am going to fight against Olympus.\u201dIt was time. YuWon got up from his seat and reentered the room.Hephaestus looked over at YuWon and said, \u201cI know that you didn\u2019t come here just to introduce him to me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe stuff\u2019s in the storage over there,\u201d he said while pointing to the basement storage of the workshop. \u201cFollow me.\u201d* * *Hargaan didn\u2019t follow them and instead stayed inside the workshop.He had a lot to think about.On the surface, he might have seemed like a carefree, loose cannon, but he was actually quite thoughtful.\u2018I\u2019m sure he needs some time to process this,\u2019 YuWon thought.YuWon was aware that Hargaan didn\u2019t blindly trust Olympus. Just take what happened on the 1st Floor as an example. That wasn\u2019t something where one could say that Olympus were the good guys.However, the Gigantomachy was a whole different problem.\u2018If he accepts ahjussi\u2019s words as the truth, Olympus will no longer be the good guys to him.\u2019For Hargaan, the pillar that he had relied on his entire life would be shaken, so it would likely take him quite a bit of time to make a decision.While leading the way, Hephaestus said, \u201cHe seems like a good kid.\u201dIt was rare for him to compliment anyone.\u201cI could tell why you brought him.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cAre you going to continue traveling with him?\u201dIt appeared that Hephaestus thought Hargaan was a part of YuWon\u2019s team.YuWon didn\u2019t answer right away as he was still thinking about it.\u201cYou think way too much,\u201d Hephaestus grumbled.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019re in any position to be telling me that, ahjussi.\u201d\u201cWhat? Me?\u201d\u201cI know you don\u2019t fully trust him yet.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still at an age where he can be swayed easily. Since there\u2019s no way to tell which direction he\u2019ll go towards, I have no choice but to continue observing.\u201d\u201cIs age the only reason?\u201d\u201cOf course not, or else I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust you either.\u201dThunk\u2014Creak, creeeeak\u2014Multiple layers of chains were undone, and a thick steel door was opened.\u201cI did end up making it, but a bit of a troublesome thing ended up getting created,\u201d Hephaestus said while undoing a sealing chain.As soon as the door was opened, black-colored mana started to slowly flow out, giving YuWon the chills.\u201cI already named it,\u201d Hephaestus said, having disliked the name YuWon had given his sword.Opening the doors wide, Hephaestus introduced his new masterpiece, \u201cThis is Kyne\u0113.*\u201d*TL/N: Kyne\u0113 is the Greek name for the Helm of Invisibility, which up till now, I have been translating as Helm of Invisibility. It shall be referred to as Kyne\u0113 from now on due to a reason that will be revealed in the next chapter.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80After Hephaestus\u2019s proud introduction, YuWon stared at the black glove that was in the middle of the room.The glove had a simple shape with a plain black color. It looked more like a fabric glove rather than a steel glove.\u2018This is Kyne\u0113?\u2019 YuWon thought.He was surprised by the introduction. He knew that Hephaestus was the one that had named the original \u300cKyne\u0113,\u300d but he didn\u2019t think the same name would be given to a different type of item.\u2018Fascinating,\u2019 he thought to himself.YuWon approached the new \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d that was different from the one he knew.The glove was floating in mid-air, and it was radiating black mana.\u201cLike you asked, I made it in the form of a glove. The crystal is imbued on the outside, but it shouldn\u2019t be visible,\u201d Hephaestus explained.YuWon took a look at the shape of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300d To the naked eye, it really was an ordinary glove, which was characteristic of the \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d in his memories.The \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d that Hades used to use was also a plain black helm with no special patterns.\u201cCan I try it on?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cOf course. That\u2019s what I made it for,\u201d Hephaestus said with joy. He was eager to explain the item he made. These were always the times that Hephaestus looked the happiest.Rustle\u2014It had a strange feel to it. Despite appearing like smooth fabric, the sensation that YuWon felt at the tips of his fingers was something in between metal and fabric. He had never felt anything like it.Its texture wasn\u2019t the only thing that was bizarre.\u201cIt\u2019s quite hefty,\u201d YuWon noted.\u300cKyne\u0113\u300d wasn\u2019t as light on his hand as it appeared. Even a fully steel gauntlet wouldn\u2019t weigh this much.\u201cIt\u2019s very thin, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hephaestus asked.\u201cYes. To the point that I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s made with adamantium.\u201d\u201cI used everything you brought.\u201dHephaestus\u2019s explanation made YuWon look at \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d with eyes full of surprise.The glove was at best only one millimeter thick, nor was it particularly big, so naturally YuWon assumed that Hephaestus might not have used all the adamantium he gave him. But after being told that it was made with all the adamantium, its heavy weight made sense.\u2018He must have decreased the volume somehow.\u2019The glove was still lighter than the adamantium YuWon gave him originally. It was just that it was much heavier than it looked.YuWon was once again surprised by Hephaestus\u2019s skills as he equipped \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d onto his hand.And in that moment\u2026Fwoosh\u2014!His vision changed in an instant.The already dark storage room now appeared pitch black.YuWon felt like he was caught in Hypnos\u2019s skill again.\u2018No. This might be even darker than that.\u2019YuWon was not taken aback by the sudden change in scenery, nor did he take off \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dThis was a test from \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dSplit\u2014A space opened up in front of him, and a large yellow eye appeared.The eye was far taller in height than YuWon, and this eye blinked a few times while it stared at YuWon.\u201c\u1437 You. Who?\u201dThe eye asked YuWon the question that he wanted to ask it.YuWon was shocked that it could speak, even if it was with a cracking, trembling voice.\u201cKim YuWon.\u201d\u201c\u1437 Other time. From. Strange.\u201dYuWon, who wasn\u2019t phased when the giant eye appeared, was shocked. He couldn\u2019t fully understand because it spoke in broken segments, but one thing it said caught YuWon off guard.\u2018Other time.\u2019\u2018What is this thing?\u2019 YuWon wondered.Including \u300cKyne\u0113,\u300d which was made from the \u300cDark Divine Crystal,\u300d not much was known about the Three Sacred Treasures of Olympus.They disappeared in the invasion of the Outers, and the only information YuWon knew were the bits and pieces he had heard from Chronos.\u201cWho are you?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201c\u1437 I\u2019m. Eye. Mouth. No. Speak\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you can\u2019t speak because you\u2019re an eye and not the mouth?\u201dIt did not answer.It was quite a frustrating conversation partner.\u2018I don\u2019t think a proper conversation is going to be possible.\u2019YuWon wanted to find out if this guy was something sealed inside the \u300cDark Divine Crystal,\u300d or if it was a medium that drew out the Crystal\u2019s power, or if it was the Crystal itself.And YuWon was also hoping that this would be the moment he\u2019d be able to properly utilize the powers of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dAround the time that YuWon had mostly given up on talking to it\u2026\u201c\u1437 Egg\u2026\u201dThe Eye spoke again.\u2018\u2018Egg\u2019?\u2019 YuWon thought.\u201c\u1437 Who Egg? Where?\u201dAnother string of words to interpret, but YuWon managed to get the gist of it.\u2018Is it asking whose egg it is? And where it came from?\u2019YuWon thought back to the Egg inside his inventory.The Egg had remained dormant since he had obtained the [Holy Fire,] and it had been a while since it had sent YuWon a message.That was when\u2026Vrrr\u2014A small movement was felt inside his inventory.[?\u2019s Egg rises up.][?\u2019s Egg lets out a scream.]The Egg moved for the first time on its own in months.Fss, fssss\u2014Reacting to the Egg, the yellow eye responded with its energy.An ominous black mana started flowing out. It was much thicker and denser than the mana YuWon had been wielding through the \u300cDark Divine Crystal.\u300d\u2018This is dangerous,\u2019 YuWon thought, evading it instinctively.Dark-attribute mana of this level could easily decompose part of a body on contact.\u2018I have to evade it\u2026\u2019Whoosh\u2014The mana was already spreading out, and there was nowhere he could escape to.The mana was moving towards YuWon to swallow him whole.\u2018It\u2019s too late.\u2019Fwoosh\u2014YuWon shot out [Holy Fire] with all his strength. There was no way for him to figure out right now how to control \u300cKyne\u0113,\u300d and with no way to avoid it, his only option was to resist it.That was when\u2026Vzzt, vzzt\u2014!The dark-attribute mana that was rippling out, rather than attacking YuWon, plunged inside the inventory on his waist.YuWon, who was going to resist with his [Holy Fire,] ended up momentarily frozen.The mana flowing out from the Eye apparently had no intention of attacking him.\u2018Then why did I\u2026?\u2019[?\u2019s Egg\u2019s incubation rate increases.][Incubation rate: 14.12%][Incubation rate: 15.23%][Incubation rate: 17.97%][Incubation rate\u2026]A flurry of messages.YuWon\u2019s eyes widened.The Egg\u2019s incubation rate was increasing, its incubation rate growing higher the more black mana it consumed from the Eye.The reason it woke up from its sleep was likely that it had found a delicious target while it was famished.[Incubation rate: 41.29%]The final incubation rate it reached was 41%.It was quite a high percentage, especially considering how it had only managed to rise 13% after eating Orochi\u2019s corpse.\u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d YuWon asked the Eye that had managed to cause the Egg\u2019s incubation rate to shoot up.The nameless Egg that YuWon possessed had come from the Outers. YuWon got the idea that perhaps this Eye would know something about where they came from.Fss, fsss\u2014The shade of the Eye started to get faint, and the darkness that enveloped him broke away. YuWon felt the chilling energy that had filled the air dissipating.\u201c\u1437 Will. Watch\u2026\u201dIts speech started to sound clearer as it faded away.And with the darkness lifting, sounds from the outside rushed in.Klang\u2014!The heavy sound of a hammer.YuWon felt the shock of the air shaking, and he saw the hammer falling on his head.Fwoosh\u2014\u201cAhjussi!\u201d YuWon shouted in a hurry, seeing whose hammer it was.He was even ready to draw his sword if necessary.\u201cHuh?\u201dThe hammer stopped halfway, and Hephaestus\u2019s face became visible as the darkness fully dissipated.Hephaestus looked shaken.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d he asked YuWon.There were various hammer marks on the ground.It appeared that he thought something bad had happened to YuWon and had been furiously swinging his hammer.YuWon couldn\u2019t answer the question right away because he had just encountered near-death. Had he been hit by Hephaestus\u2019s full swing of his hammer, it wouldn\u2019t have ended with just an injury.\u2018Well, whatever the case is, it\u2019s over now,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself while looking at the black glove he now wore on his hand.It felt pretty good, with a smooth and soft texture. If it weren\u2019t for the weight, he could have forgotten about it and think that it was just a part of his body.\u300cKyne\u0113.\u300d An item that symbolized Hades, one of the three great gods of Olympus.\u2018It said it would watch me\u2026\u2019Those were the final words the Eye of \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d said before disappearing.\u2018But it did manage to say something proper before it disappeared.\u2019It was hard to make out the other things it said, but the final part was clear.Clench\u2014YuWon tightened his fist.\u2018The Dark Divine Crystal\u2026\u2019It was an item that was also called a fragment of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dWho would have thought such a secret hid in this item.\u2018There are two fragments left.\u2019There were three total fragments in YuWon\u2019s memory.\u2018I\u2019ll need to gather the rest to figure out what\u2019s what.\u2019His next objective was now the Trident\u2019s fragment.* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 NumbaWonProofreader \u2013 BringTheRaynJoin our discord for updates on releases!\u00a0https://discord.gg/reapercomics* * *The workshop shook.Hargaan, who was lost in thought, jolted up and ran in the direction that YuWon and Hephaestus had gone off in.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Hargaan asked.Hephaestus and YuWon were exiting the storage room.Hargaan could see an unfamiliar glove on YuWon\u2019s hand. He guessed that it must have been a new item that YuWon had obtained.\u201cWho knows,\u201d Hephaestus said.The answer he got just made Hargaan more confused.\u201cI don\u2019t know either,\u201d YuWon reponsded.\u201cWha\u2014?\u201d Hargaan said, dumbfounded.\u201cJust ask him, though he might actually not know anything,\u201d Hephaestus said as he walked away.Hargaan presumed that the noise earlier must have been from Hephaestus swinging his hammer since he was wielding it in his hand.\u201cSo what did he mean?\u201d Hargaan asked YuWon.\u201cWho knows?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re also going on about that?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019m saying that because I really don\u2019t know.\u201dYuWon genuinely didn\u2019t know what the fragment of \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d was, and the commotion was from Hephaestus trying to save YuWon, sensing that the fragment was too dangerous.\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t fight?\u201dNot knowing a thing, the only assumption Hargaan could make was that Hephaestus and YuWon had gotten into a spontaneous fight.\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon answered.\u201cThat\u2019s good then.\u201d\u201cDid you manage to think things over?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still conflicted,\u201d Hargaan said while scratching his head.It wasn\u2019t that Hargaan didn\u2019t trust Hephaestus\u2019s words. There were people who hadn\u2019t had a good opinion of the Gigantomachy for a long time.\u201cI think I need to first go meet my older brother and sister,\u201d Hargaan told YuWon.\u201cAnd who would those be? It\u2019s not like you have just one or two siblings.\u201d\u201cBig brother Apollo and big sister Artemis.\u201dThey were two children that Zeus had with someone other than Hera, just like Hargaan.It appeared to YuWon that they were closer to each other than their other siblings as they were in the same situation.\u201cThey must know something,\u201d Hargaan said.Apollo and Artemis were two of the top ten High Rankers within Olympus, and as they had directly participated in the Gigantomachy, they should have a lot of information.It seemed that Hargaan was being very thoughtful and careful about this ordeal.\u201cThough I\u2019m honestly not sure. For now, I should just focus on the Grand Martial Arts Tournament. I need to make my name better known for my influence within Olympus to grow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m surprised that you care about things like that so much.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. I\u2019m different from big brother Ares. In order to create a faction that follows me, I have to keep proving my worth,\u201d Hargaan said with a voice filled with resolve.YuWon couldn\u2019t know how Hargaan felt growing up and the current state of his emotions.\u201cThere\u2019s no better stage for that than this tournament. I heard that there are more Rankers spectating this tournament than ever before,\u201d Hargaan continued.The Grand Martial Arts Tournament was always an event that people paid a lot of attention to, but the scale of it changed every time because the number of Rankers watching (as well as the fame of said Rankers) depended on the quality of the players participating.In that regard, this Grand Martial Arts Tournament was being watched by the greatest number of people in its history, and there was a simple reason for this\u2014the quality of the players was outstanding.Of course, about half of them were primarily interested in YuWon.Hargaan listed the Rankers and guilds that came to watch the tournament, \u201c\u2026 And I heard that a few wandering Rankers were also present. Oh, right, also\u2026\u201dThere was also another reason why this tournament was so greatly in contention.\u201cI heard that the vice-lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult is going to be there this time around,\u201d Hargaan continued.The sleeping tiger had left its den.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Chapter 81Hargaan\u2019s words made YuWon\u2019s eyebrows twitch ever so slightly at the mention of the vice-lord of the Cult.\u2018But that\u2019s me,\u2019 YuWon thought to himself.He checked his title, \u2018Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2019It was the next highest position in the Cult after the Lord, giving one the power to command players that joined the Cult.The problem was that the Cult was currently dormant in the Martial Realm.That meant\u2026\u2018They\u2019re finally reemerging,\u2019 YuWon hypothesized.That was very much in the realm of possibility. The only reason why the Cult had been holed up in Mt. Heaven was due to the Heavenly Demon\u2019s stubbornness to protect the Holy Fire. Now that their long wish had been fulfilled, it wasn\u2019t strange for the Cult to start making moves.\u2018And they chose the Grand Martial Arts Tournament as their first stage\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought while recollecting the Heavenly Demon\u2019s face. \u2018He\u2019s a sly fox, unlike his appearance.The Heavenly Demon was known as the greatest martial arts master in the Martial Realm. Unlike NamGung JinWoon who just barely hadn\u2019t managed to become a High Ranker, the Heavenly Demon had a high ranking even among High Rankers.He was an incredibly talented martial artist and the leader who created the current Heavenly Demonic Cult.YuWon had no way of knowing if the rumors were started by someone within the Cult or if it was planned by the Heavenly Demon, but this wasn\u2019t a bad situation for him.\u2018If the Cult has started moving, they\u2019ll become a great help,\u2019 thought YuWon.The Heavenly Demonic Cult, despite being a singular martial school, was debated as being one of the greatest forces in the Martial Realm.In a way, YuWon had obtained a backing that was even greater than the one Hoon had.\u201cSeeing as it\u2019s the first time the Heavenly Demonic Cult is making an appearance, the vice-lord has to be someone really skilled. I wonder if they\u2019re a Ranker or a player. If they\u2019re a Ranker, they won\u2019t be able to compete in the tournament, so I won\u2019t get a chance to face them,\u201d Hargaan blabbered on.Hargaan had the impression that the vice-lord of the Cult was likely a Ranker, but that was only natural.The vice-lord had power within the Cult that was second only to the Lord. It was hard to imagine that the Cult would give such a position to a mere player.\u201cDidn\u2019t you pass the Cult\u2019s test? Do you know anything?\u201d Hargaan\u00a0 asked.\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cHuh? What is?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m the vice-lord,\u201d YuWon explained nonchalantly.Hargaan looked stunned for a bit, unable to process what he had heard. But when the gears started turning again and he understood YuWon\u2019s words, his eyes widened.\u201cYou\u2019re the vice-lord?\u201d Hargaan asked in shock.\u201cYep.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the vice-lord a position that\u2019s similar to the vice-head of a noble clan?\u201d\u201cSomething like that.\u201dHargaan\u2019s jaw dropped.He had heard that YuWon was the first person to pass the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test.Hargaan himself had managed to pass the NamGung Clan\u2019s test which was famous for its difficulty, but the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test was known to be even harder.He knew that YuWon was an amazing guy, but he didn\u2019t know it was to this degree\u2026\u201cWas that the reward? The position of vice-lord?\u201dYuWon nodded his head in response.Sponsored ContentThe real reward was the [Holy Fire,] and the position of vice-lord was just a bonus reward he got, but YuWon saw no reason to explain everything in detail.\u201cGods be damned\u2026\u201d Hargaan mumbled with regret, his back against the wall. \u201cMaybe I should have challenged it.\u201dUnlike YuWon, Hargaan had a lot of interest in factions.The Heavenly Demonic Cult was undeniably the greatest faction in the Martial Realm. Even if their current finances weren\u2019t stellar, they had multiple Rankers in their midst, and just having the Heavenly Demon, a High Ranker, put them above the NamGung Clan.And the vice-lord was someone who was able to wield the power to command that organization. To Hargaan, that was the most tempting reward one could possibly obtain.\u201cOnce this gets out of the bag, your value is going to shoot up even higher,\u201d Hargaan commented.\u201cI have no intention of joining any group.\u201d\u201cI know that, but the other guilds are going to think differently,\u201d Hargaan said with a smile on his face. \u201cYou know, tomorrow\u2019s going to be quite fun.\u201d* * *The day of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament dawned.Yang Wonil, a player of the School of the Sapphire Sword strutted along with his shoulders held high.\u2018It\u2019s finally the Grand Martial Arts Tournament,\u2019 he thought.The head of the Sapphire Sword had high hopes for the tournament.Not only was it the biggest event held in the Martial Realm, it was an event that was well-known within the Tower.If a player that was associated with the School of the Sapphire Sword performed well in the tournament, the status of the school would immediately go up within the Martial Realm.\u2018I have to get in the good eyes of the head this time around,\u2019 Wonil thought.For that purpose, he had started climbing the Tower again, reaching the 18th Floor. Considering the rules of the tournament only permitted players under the 25th Floor to participate, he had made it to a pretty high floor.Also\u2026\u2018While at the Sapphire Sword, I honed and sharpened my sword.\u2019He hadn\u2019t just been killing time by remaining in the Martial Realm. For this day, he had been practicing the martials arts of the Sapphire Sword again and again. And in that process, he had raised his stats, levels, and skill proficiency, making it easy for him to surpass the 15th Floor, which he was previously stuck on.Clench\u2014He felt confident.In this Grand Martial Arts Tournament, even if it wasn\u2019t winning, he had to place high.And for that\u2026\u201cI\u2019ll have to at least pass the preliminaries with ease.\u201dStep, step\u2014The stage of the tournament was now within eyesight.Tens of thousands of players were participating in the tournament, and the rules of the preliminaries were simple. Ten players would get on the stage at once, and the last person standing would move onto the main leg of the tournament.No one knew until the preliminaries started who were in each group of ten.\u2018I wonder who\u2019ll be here,\u2019 Wonil thought as he climbed up on the stage.\u201cWhooooah!\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re coming!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s all here?\u201d\u201cThat guy. Isn\u2019t that a descendent of the SeoMoon Noble Clan?\u201cDidn\u2019t he just get to the 10th Floor?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Yang Wonil! The bastard of the School of the Sapphire Sword!\u201d\u201cYang Wonil? Where?\u201dThe stage was massive.It was a special stadium made for the Grand Martial Arts Tournament. And towering above that stadium were seats that could accommodate an audience of a hundred thousand people.The stadium itself was wide enough where thousands of people could use it at once. Its massive size was also made for Rankers to duel each other on. Built using the technology of other floors, this stadium was one of the greatest architectural works in the Tower.Wonil puffed up his chest. \u2018There are some people that recognize me,\u2019 he thought to himself.Being called a bastard wasn\u2019t pleasant, but people still knew his name as he had been active in the Martial Realm for quite a while now.\u2018I\u2019m finally on this stage.\u2019He had been going at it for a long time just for this day.With tensions running high, he looked around.The player that he was most on guard against was the player from the SeoMoon clan.\u2018Even if he just got to the 10th Floor, a Pure-Blood from the SeoMoon noble clan should not be underestimated. If avoidable, I shouldn\u2019t face him directly and work around him,\u2019 Wonil strategized.Players from noble clans, even if they weren\u2019t players of high floors, still had a certain level of skill.Wonil kept SeoMoon Chang in his mind as he turned his gaze.\u2018I don\u2019t have any intel on the other guys. Most of them must be nobodies\u2026 Huh?\u2019Wonil\u2019s thought was interrupted as a familiar face came into his line of sight.It didn\u2019t come to him right away, but it didn\u2019t take long for him to remember who it was.\u2018That guy is\u2026\u2019 Wonil recollected.It was an incident that happened while he was recruiting new players on the orders of the head of the Sapphire Sword.It was the guy that humiliated him.\u2018It\u2019s him,\u2019 Wonil thought with fury in his eyes.He hadn\u2019t been able to find him until now, yet he had casually run into him at the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.\u2018It\u2019s as the old proverb says, \u2018enemies are bound to meet head-on on a narrow road.\u2019\u2019He had been honing his skills while climbing the Tower. Not only was he stronger now, he wasn\u2019t going to underestimate him this time. Wonil was confident he could easily wipe the floor with a guy that had only recently made it to the 10th Floor.As Wonil was thinking, \u2018You\u2019re dead meat\u2026\u2019\u201cI-It\u2019s Kim YuWon!\u201d someone shouted.That created an instant commotion, like pouring oil onto a fire.\u201cKim YuWon?\u201d\u201cHuh? Really?\u201d\u201cWhere? Who said that?\u201dAfter Kim Yuwon\u2019s presence was pointed out by someone that knew his face, the audience started their search for him.YuWon was the player who was the center of attention of this tournament, but as he didn\u2019t do much other than climb the Tower, his face wasn\u2019t well-known.\u2018Kim YuWon is here?\u2019 Wonil thought. Even he had heard a lot of rumors regarding YuWon.There were even people saying that YuWon might be the greatest player in the history of the Tower because he was setting a new record on every test.\u2018I\u2019m fucked,\u2019 Wonil dreaded. Why did he have to end up in this group out of all the possible groups?He was already thinking he was unlucky to end up with SeoMoon Chang in his group, but he had, in fact, ended up in the same group with the worst opponent possible.\u2018Since it\u2019s come to this\u2026\u2019 Wonil thought while glaring at his enemy, \u2018I\u2019m going to at least cut you down.\u2019In fact, it was possible that even if he lost here, things could go well for him if he stood out in the preliminaries since the audience was bound to remember the match where YuWon was present.[10][9][8][\u2026]A number that was floating in the air started counting down.Wonil desperately waited for the number to become one.Finally, the numbers counted down, and\u2026[1]Dash\u2014Shing\u2014!Wonil leapt forward and drew the sword on his waist.\u201cRemember me?\u201d Wonil shouted.Slash\u2014!Wonil\u2019s sword cut through thin air.He thought he would cut him down, but his target had managed to sidestep his attack.His attack missed by a thin margin, so Wonil moved lightly on his feet and continued with his technique.\u201cI haven\u2019t forgotten about the humiliation you presented me that day\u2026\u201dBump\u2014Wonil felt a slight impact on the bottom of his jaw. It didn\u2019t hurt much, as if it was a punch from a kid.\u2018What was that?\u2019 Wonil wondered.He couldn\u2019t tell what it was that hit his jaw, so he decided to just ignore it since whatever he was hit by, he wouldn\u2019t feel a thing no matter how many times he was hit by it.Or so he thought\u2026\u2018Huh?\u2019Wonil stopped in his tracks.No matter how much strength he tried to muster, he couldn\u2019t move.Klang\u2014His hand gave out, and his sword fell to the stadium floor.While looking at his opponent\u2019s face, he felt a sense of despair. For things to end right when they had only just started\u2026\u201cMy\u2026 name is\u2026 Yang\u2026\u201d as Wonil tried to say his name\u2026Thud\u2014\u2026 His body flopped onto the ground.\u201cSo, who are you?\u201d YuWon asked, confused at the guy that suddenly charged at him and got knocked out by a single hit.This Yang guy spoke as if he had been wronged by YuWon, but YuWon had no recollection of meeting someone like him during any part of the test.\u2018Did he already faint?\u2019 YuWon wondered.He didn\u2019t even hit him hard, so he shrugged it off as someone who was just weak.And with that, YuWon stopped paying attention to Wonil, who laid on the floor, knocked out and drooling.There were now nine players left.With Wonil\u2019s surprise attack, people\u2019s attention was already centered on YuWon.\u201cWhat did he just do?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t even see anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That guy must be Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cI heard the rumors. Black eyes and black hair. Dons the Pyromancy Robe. He matches the description.\u201d\u201cThen it must be him.\u201dAll the players in the same group were wary of YuWon.It was only natural, since only one player could make it to the main stage of the tournament. Without taking down YuWon, it was impossible to move further on in the tournament.\u201cIt seems like everyone knows now\u2026\u201d YuWon said.He had wanted to take it easy in the preliminaries, but he\u2019d changed his mind.YuWon slowly drew his sword while looking around at the other eight players, saying, \u201cYou can come at me one at a time, or you can fight me all at once.\u201dShhhnk\u2014A sharp sound rang out while he drew his blade.YuWon decided not to avoid the attention he had gathered.There was a high level of tension filling the stadium.\u201cLet\u2019s finish this quickly and not drag this out,\u201d YuWon announced.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He\u2019s already here!\u201d\u201cTo the right!\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s left!\u201d\u201cWhich fucking side is it?!\u201dAs if they had made a promise beforehand, the players tried to cooperate with each other, but the results weren\u2019t so stellar.Pshk\u2014!\u00a0\u00a0Read first at L i g h t n o v e l r e a d e r . o r g\u201cKugh\u2026!\u201dAlong with a sword slash to the chest, a strong impact flung a player many meters into the air.Whoosh\u2014The player came back down, slamming into the ground.Afterwards, the other players started to shout over one another.\u201cOver here!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a sword!\u201d\u201cThen what is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! But it felt more like a blunt object\u2026\u201d\u201cIs it maybe the flat part of the sword?\u201dIt was absolute chaos.Almost no one was capable of keeping up with YuWon\u2019s movements with their eyes, but SeoMoon Chang could at least see YuWon\u2019s faintly moving afterimages.\u2018Over there,\u2019 Chang thought.He could see the tip of the sword moving, but he couldn\u2019t react to it.Fwoosh\u2014!The sword reached him a beat, no, a few beats faster than he had anticipated.\u2018I\u2019m dead\u2026!\u2019 Chang braced himself.Tap\u2014The tip of the blade lightly tapped his nose.It was a light hit, like an adult scolding a child.Wham\u2014!\u201cKgh\u2026!\u201dA kick launched Chang into the air, and he tumbled across the ground.He barely managed to stop himself from throwing up all his insides.\u201cCough, kgh!\u201dChang vomited blood while hacking and coughing then grit his teeth to endure the pain in his chest.\u2018That\u2019s at least a few broken ribs,\u2019 Chang thought to himself.It was impossible for him to continue fighting in this state. Heavens knew if he was still capable of fighting, but he had lost his will.One had to at least be in the same ballpark for it to be a real fight, so with how large of a gap there was between him and YuWon, it was no wonder he didn\u2019t want to fight anymore.\u201cU-Ugh\u2026\u201d\u201cKgh\u2026\u201dPlayers that had been beaten up by YuWon were groaning and rolling on the ground. Half had fainted while the other half were lying down with injuries.There were no fatalities from what Chang could see.\u2018Everyone\u2019s alive?\u2019 he couldn\u2019t believe it.This was a tournament where people fought using weapons, so it was inevitable for some to end up dead.However, it wasn\u2019t by chance that in such a tournament not a single person died.\u2018Is he going easy on us?\u2019 Chang wondered, unable to believe it.People who decided to participate in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament had a certain level of confidence in their skills. In such a situation, Chang had a hard time believing that YuWon went easy on not just one or two opponents but while facing eight of them simultaneously.That\u2019s when he remembered\u2026\u2018Earlier\u2026\u2019 Chang thought back to how YuWon\u2019s sword had a clear shot at his head. He had braced himself for death, but instead of being cut down, he was only kicked.In the heat of the moment, he thought that the sword must have been a fakeout, and his kick was the real attack, but after thinking things through, those two movements connected too unnaturally.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026\u201d Chang was baffled.This might have just been the preliminaries, but in \u2018The Grand Martial Arts Tournament\u2019 YuWon was acting like an adult facing children.* * *After his match was over, YuWon waited for Hargaan\u2019s match. Hargaan\u2019s fight was the match after the next.\u201cWinner, Hargaan!\u201d\u201cWhooooa\u2014!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cHe took down everyone by himself\u2026\u201d\u201cThere was another guy like Kim YuWon?!\u201dVzzt, vzzt\u2014There were still remnants of the Hargaan\u2019s electric attack in the arena.From the AOE electric attack to physical abilities and mana, everything about Hargaan was on a level that was not of a low-floor player.\u2018He really did become stronger.\u2019Even YuWon was impressed, understanding how Hargaan was managing to rise in the rankings with each subsequent floor.It was an unbelievable growth speed.YuWon had heard that he had just cleared the 25th Floor, but his skills matched those of high-floor players.\u2018His potential might be even higher.\u2019Hargaan\u2019s mana resembled Zeus\u2019s the most. From his talent at manipulating electricity, along with his skills and appearance, he was a spitting image of Zeus.\u2018He\u2019s going to be a force to be reckoned with when he becomes a Ranker.\u2019YuWon found it worthwhile having waited to see his match, but with that, he got up from his seat. He saw no reason to watch the remaining matches and left.As he was leaving the first floor exit\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d shouted a faintly familiar voice.YuWon stared at a man pointing his finger at him.His face was also somewhat familiar\u2026\u201cRight,\u201d YuWon finally remembered. \u201cWhat was your name?\u201d\u2026 But he only remembered the face. He couldn\u2019t remember the name.The man\u2019s face turned red from feeling looked down upon.\u201cIt\u2019s Yang Wonil!\u201d the man shouted, approaching YuWon, huffing and puffing in anger.\u2026 Or at least he tried to approach YuWon.\u201cWait,\u201d a man standing behind Wonil grabbed him by his shoulder.YuWon got an uneasy feeling while looking at the man.\u2018Is he a Ranker?\u2019 YuWon wondered.\u00a0Read first at L i g h t n o v e l r e a d e r . o r gThe man\u2019s strength was on a completely different level than Wonil. He was almost two meters tall with a muscular build. It was clear that this man was strong.\u201cI apologize. A disciple of our school was too rude to you,\u201d the man said.\u201cWho are you?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cI am the head of the School of the Sapphire Sword. My name is Moon SoBaek.\u201dYuWon had an inkling that he would be no ordinary player. A head of a martial school meant that he should have at least been on the level of a Ranker.For such a person to come here in person\u2026 From YuWon\u2019s experience, they usually only had one business.\u201cI\u2019m not interested,\u201d YuWon declined.\u201cYou don\u2019t even want to hear what I have to say?\u201d SoBaek asked.\u201cAre you not here to recruit me into your school?\u201dSoBaek looked slightly shocked, but that was only for a split second. He immediately returned back to his composed self. It seemed that he had somewhat expected such a response.\u201cThat\u2019s right. I heard that you rejected all the recruitment offers from major guilds,\u201d SoBaek said.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cTo be clear, the School of the Sapphire Sword isn\u2019t a guild. We might be a part of the Martial Guild, but we are more of a martial school than a guild,\u201d SoBaek tried to persuade YuWon.YuWon thought his logic was hilarious. Telling someone to join their school without a test is no different than a guild recruitment offer. In essence, it was asking him to be affiliated with them.\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re aware, but our Sapphire Sword School has a long history. We might have weakened a bit in recent times, but our school can be said to be the first school to continue on the tradition of the Martial Realm,\u201d SoBaek went on a long, noisy sales pitch. \u201cIf you join us, we will be able to achieve everything for our school. I realized it the moment I saw you fighting in the arena. The future of our school is\u2026\u201d\u201cI wish you the best with your school, now goodbye,\u201d YuWon said while passing SoBaek, not interested in hearing him out any longer.SoBaek was taken aback. He didn\u2019t expect YuWon to just cleanly cut him off and walk away. He did think YuWon might reject him, but not so firmly and easily. He thought he\u2019d at least get a chance to chat over a cup of tea or something.\u201cPlease wait a moment,\u201d SoBaek said while grabbing YuWon\u2019s shoulder.YuWon stared at SoBaek.SoBaek was no longer smiling, and with the smile gone, it revealed his harsh face.\u2018He looks rough,\u2019 YuWon thought, thinking that his face looked like that of a menacing bandit. If he\u2019d had a beard, it would have been the cherry on top.Mana filled with fighting spirit shimmered around SoBaek.YuWon was able to read the anger hiding behind SoBaek\u2019s mana.\u201cIt seems you haven\u2019t fully understood me,\u201d SoBaek spoke.\u201cWhat did I not understand?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t an offer,\u201d SoBaek said while tightly gripping his shoulder. \u201cDo you understand now?\u201dYuWon looked at the hand on his shoulder.He had expected such a confrontation to occur at least once, and so he was prepared to have a go in such a case.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of what will happen to a Ranker that messes with a participant of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament,\u201d YuWon said, his tone shifting.SoBaek smiled slyly at the change in mood. \u201cOf course I do,\u201d he said.\u201cSo you\u2019re not afraid of the NamGung Clan?\u201dThe Grand Martial Arts Tournament was a tournament held by the NamGung Clan, the clan led by the head of the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance. Cleaning up any incidents that happened within it was the responsibility of the NamGung Clan. Thus, messing with a participant of the tournament was like a direct challenge against the NamGung Clan.Moon SoBaek, the head of the School of the Sapphire Sword, might have been a Ranker, but his school was still a weak, minor martial school compared to the great NamGung noble clan.The NamGung Clan had over ten Rankers, and they even had NamGung JinWoon, who was almost a High Ranker.\u201cIs that why you\u2019ve been acting so cocky? Because you trust the NamGung Clan?\u201d SoBaek let out a laugh. \u201cThe head of the JeGal Clan is my blood brother. Did you really think I\u2019d fear the NamGung Clan?\u201dYuWon was wondering why he was being so bold. It turned out that he had a pocket ace.\u201cDoes your blood brother know that his big brother is such a bastard?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cOf course,\u201d SoBaek said boastfully. \u201cNow don\u2019t be so prickly. I want to have a good relationship with you. If you take your time to hear me out, you\u2019ll learn that our Sapphire Sword School isn\u2019t such a bad place.\u201d\u201cI refuse,\u201d YuWon said while grabbing SoBaek\u2019s wrist.Using force, YuWon tried to push away the hand that was grabbing his shoulder.SoBaek\u2019s eyebrow twitched from the amount of strength exerted by YuWon.\u2018This guy\u2026\u2019 SoBaek thought.He knew that YuWon was incredibly skilled for a player on the lower floors, but to have so much strength\u2026\u2018This won\u2019t be easy,\u2019 SoBaek determined.Spark, crackle\u2014SoBaek strengthened his grip, but as he exerted more power, the penalty slowly started up.Despite that\u2026\u2018What the\u2014?\u2019 SoBaek couldn\u2019t believe it.Little by little, his hand was moving.YuWon was actually pushing away his hand.\u201cYou asked if I was cocky because I trust the Namgung Clan,\u201d YuWon said.Squeeze\u2014SoBaek started feeling a bit of pain from how tightly YuWon was holding his wrist.He couldn\u2019t believe it. He was being conscientious in how much strength he used due to the penalty, but for him to get pushed away\u2026\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon continued, \u201cI only trust myself.\u201d\u201cKgh\u2026\u201d SoBaek grunted in pain.Fwip\u2014SoBaek quickly broke away from YuWon\u2019s grip.He could have ignored the penalty and used more of his power, but he didn\u2019t even have time to weigh his options.Originally, SoBaek thought that he just had to crush YuWon with force since he didn\u2019t have to worry about the aftermath with the NamGung Clan too much.\u201cSo you\u2019re pretty skilled,\u201d SoBaek commented.It turned out that things wouldn\u2019t be so easy.Shing\u2014!SoBaek drew his sword.It was a blue sword befitting the name of the head of the School of the Sapphire Sword.SoBaek quickly started assessing the situation, checking if anyone was nearby.\u2018The tournament is going full force,\u2019 SoBaek thought. It\u2019d be at least a while before people started leaving the stadium.SoBaek was relieved, \u2018I\u2019m glad I ordered a guy to be on look out just in case.\u2019From the beginning, he had intended on using force if YuWon didn\u2019t listen to him, since as long as he could somehow take YuWon to his school, he\u2019d be able to get YuWon to listen to him one way or another.\u2018Let\u2019s not drag this out\u2026\u2019 SoBaek resolved himself.\u201cRight. Actually, there is one thing.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cSomething I trust,\u201d YuWon said.YuWon\u2019s gaze shifted to behind SoBaek.Step\u2014\u00a0Read first at L i g h t n o v e l r e a d e r . o r gOut of nowhere, a presence could be felt.There was nothing nearby, but in an instant, a presence grew close to them.SoBaek felt an odd sensation, as if a ferocious beast was approaching him from behind.\u201cI thought you were taking too long, sir,\u201d a man spoke.SoBaek turned his head to find a large man had approached them. His outfit and way of speech made him seem like someone from the Martial Realm, but SoBaek had never once seen this man before.The man looked back and forth between YuWon and SoBaek before asking, \u201cWhat are you doing here\u2026\u201dIt was the Heavenly Fist Lord, Pung BaekLim.The man who had fought with YuWon during the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test politely bowed and greeted YuWon, \u201c\u2026 Vice-Lord?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Chapter 83Pung BaekLim\u2019s words made Moon SoBaek doubt his ears.\u2018\u2018Vice-Lord\u2019?\u2019 SoBaek wondered.It was a title he was unfamiliar with, and for a moment he thought maybe somehow he misheard \u2018Vice-Head\u2019 as \u2018Vice-Lord.\u2019But before that\u2026\u2018I thought YuWon didn\u2019t have a martial school that he was affiliated with\u2026\u2019 SoBaek wondered.Then it hit him, \u2018Could it be?\u2019There was only a single place in the current Martial Realm that used the title of \u2018Vice-Lord.\u2019A faction that was closer to a religious group than a martial school. Based on Mt. Heaven, it was the faction that could truly claim to be the strongest martial organization.The Heavenly Demonic Cult.It was a widely spread rumor that the vice-lord of the Cult was participating in this tournament, and YuWon was the only player to have ever passed the Cult\u2019s test.\u2018Still, there\u2019s no way they gave him the role of vice-lord just from passing a lowly test\u2026\u2019 SoBaek felt confused.He wanted to doubt the situation, but he had seen it with his own eyes just now.Gulp\u2014SoBaek lowered his sword, and BaekLim glared him in the eyes while walking towards YuWon.Having gauged the situation, he smacked his palm with his fist.\u201cIs this a fight, sir?\u201d BaekLim asked.\u201cWe haven\u2019t started yet,\u201d YuWon answered.YuWon was naturally speaking less politely, while on the other hand, BaekLim was now speaking to YuWon with respect, unlike before. They were simply following the rules of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cWhat would you like me to do?\u201d BaekLim asked while looking back to SoBaek. \u201cShould I kill him?\u201dBaekLim seemed ready to fight, like he was waiting for YuWon\u2019s order to drop.An intense fighting spirit started flowing out from BaekLim\u2019s body, and in an instant, SoBaek felt miniscule compared to him.\u2018He\u2019s a Ranker,\u2019 SoBaek realized.And he realized that BaekLim wasn\u2019t just an ordinary Ranker but a cut above most Rankers in the Martial Realm.SoBaek tried to gauge what it would be like to fight BaekLim.\u2018I have a 90% chance of losing\u2026 And even if I did win, that would still be a problem,\u2019 SoBaek calculated the various scenarios in his head.His opponent was a Ranker of the Heavenly Demonic Cult, so even if he won, he\u2019d be making enemies out of them.In the end, there was only one decision he could make.\u201cAhem. I-I apologize,\u201d SoBaek let out a fake cough and composed himself while putting his sword back in his scabbard. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you were the vice-lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Had I known you were already a part of a martial school, I wouldn\u2019t have approached you.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not a martial school. Don\u2019t treat us like we\u2019re the same,\u201d said BaekLim.\u201cA-Anyway\u2026\u201d BaekLim wiped away the cold sweat on his forehead as he turned around and walked away. \u201cOnce again, I\u2019m sorry. Farewell then.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYuWon watched SoBaek walk away in a hurry.BaekLim glared at him in discontent.\u201cAre you going to just let him go?\u201d he asked Yuwon.\u201cI don\u2019t really know what his deal is, but he\u2019s not what\u2019s important.\u201d\u201cThen what is important?\u201d\u201cIt seems like the JeGal Clan is backing him.\u201d\u201cThe JeGal Clan, you say, sir\u2026\u201d BaekLim mulled over his words with a slight grin. \u201cWell, we have a dinner meeting with the NamGung Clan after the tournament. I\u2019ll bring it up with them then. If there is foul play going on, it needs to be properly punished.\u201d\u201cA dinner meeting? With the NamGung Clan?\u201d\u201cWould you like to join us, sir?\u201dThe NamGung Clan was the place that had become recognized as the greatest martial school while the Heavenly Demonic Cult was holed up in Mt. Heaven.YuWon didn\u2019t think that the Cult that was just now starting to make moves would meet with the NamGung clan so quickly.\u201cWas it you guys who spread the rumor?\u201d\u201cWhat rumor do you mean?\u201d\u201cThe one about the vice-lord participating in the tournament.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2026\u201d BaekLim started grinning, \u201cThe cult members must have blabbered because they\u2019re excited to be able to go out into the Martial Realm again. Those guys are pretty talkative.\u201d\u201cWas your personality always like this?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cI\u2019m always like this when I\u2019m not fighting, sir. Hahahah!\u201d That unabashed laughter was recognizably BaekLim\u2019s trademark.YuWon shook his head while letting out a sigh.\u2018The Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2026\u2019 he thought deeply.It was a title that was somewhat forced onto him, but in that process he ended up gaining a much greater authority than he had expected.YuWon contemplated the potential ripple the Cult\u2019s activities would cause.\u201cI\u2019ll pass on the dinner meeting.\u201dThe meeting was likely just for socialization, and YuWon was not fond of such gatherings.\u201cJust make sure you properly take care of the head of the School of the Sapphire Sword and his blood brother,\u201d YuWon instructed.BaekLim bowed after receiving YuWon\u2019s orders, \u201cAs you wish, sir.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dYuWon walked ahead while BaekLim followed behind.The greatest organization in the Martial Realm, the Heavenly Demonic Cult.YuWon had decided to freely wield their power to its full extent.* * *In a tall, five-story building located next to the stadium\u2026At the most expensive lodging in the area where you could see a view of the massive stadium outside the window, the Heavenly Demon Cheon MuJin was waiting for YuWon.\u201cGood job,\u201d MuJin told YuWon.\u201cWhat did I do to warrant a \u2018good job\u2019?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you on your way back from the preliminaries?\u201d\u201cDid you watch?\u201d\u201cNo. I knew you were going to win, so I didn\u2019t see the need,\u201d MuJin said while preparing tea. \u201cAm I wrong?\u201dYuWon picked up the teacup as MuJin poured him some tea.The weight of the tea felt like it was a thousand pounds. The flowing tea imbued with MuJin\u2019s mana was like a waterfall.\u2018Is this a test?\u2019 YuWon wondered.It was a simple but hard test.YuWon responded, \u201cPerhaps,\u201d while enduring it by imbuing the teacup with his own mana.Sweat started to run down YuWon\u2019s forehead with his lukewarm response.It was like a large waterfall was falling down into a single point.Crack\u2014A small fracture appeared on the teacup.As YuWon thought, \u2018I can\u2019t let it break\u2026\u2019Fss, fss\u2014Mana started to flow out from Kyne\u0113.There was a brief second of stability, before he felt like darkness was consuming his entire body.Plop\u2014The final drop of tea fell into the teacup, and the cup almost shattered.\u201cI see,\u201d MuJin said.To normal eyes, one would have just thought it was a scene of someone pouring tea, but for YuWon, enduring this moment was harder than any fight he had experienced so far in this life.MuJin continued, \u201cWhy are you participating in something like the Grand Martial Arts Tournament? Your skills don\u2019t belong in a children\u2019s fight.\u201d\u201cI need the prize.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the Great Scarlet Medicine Ball?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d YuWon explained while staring at the cracked teacup, \u201cI\u2019m a bit short.\u201dHe had reached 99 Arcane Power.How would things have been different if he had 100 Arcane Power?Not only would it not have been so hard for him to endure MuJin\u2019s tea pour, the teacup likely wouldn\u2019t have cracked.\u201cDon\u2019t get caught up by numbers\u2026 is the advice I wish I could give, but I know that\u2019s not possible.\u201d\u201cUnlike you, Lord, I\u2019m not a true martial artist. As long as I have the system, numbers are important.\u201d\u201cI understand. So that\u2019s why you need the Great Scarlet Medicine Ball?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not guaranteed that consuming it will push me over, but it is quite possible.\u201dYuWon had to overcome this hurdle as quickly as possible, as that was the \u2018first condition\u2019 that he had imposed on himself.\u201cThe Great Scarlet Medicine Ball is definitely a good elixir. It being the prize is a large reason as to how the Grand Martial Arts Tournament became such a big event,\u201d MuJin spoke while nodding his head, having now understood YuWon\u2019s motivations.MuJin took a sip of his tea.Parched from having used a good amount of power, YuWon drank from the cracked cup before asking, \u201cI\u2019d like to know what brings you here, Lord? I thought the Heavenly Demonic Cult didn\u2019t leave Mt. Heaven.\u201d\u201cI thought it was about time we started our activities.\u201d\u201cActivities? What kind of activities?\u201d\u201cAccepting new cultists, conducting tests, expanding our faction, firmly implanting our influence. Stuff like that.\u201d\u201cWhat about Mt. Heaven?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go back and forth a lot. Technology has advanced a lot in recent years, so it\u2019s quite easy to travel.\u201dMuJin had decided to be active in the Martial Realm, which was a resolution that would overturn the order and power dynamic of the Martial Realm in an instant since MuJin could be described as being the essence of the Cult itself.\u201cWill it be okay?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI said it before, but I\u2019m not suited for the role of vice-lord because I have no intention of being tied down to a single place.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t be fulfilling my responsibilities while taking advantage of my power. The cult members will probably voice strong opposition.\u201d\u201cI am the \u2018Heaven\u2019 of the Heavenly Demonic Cult. Since I\u2019ve acknowledged you, no one can oppose your will,\u201d MuJin said with a calm voice.He spoke nonchalantly as if he was talking about undeniable facts, like the sun rising in the morning. Because to MuJin, this was the natural order.\u201cI could potentially ruin the Heavenly Demonic Cult,\u201d YuWon warned.However, that wasn\u2019t the only thing YuWon was concerned about.YuWon said, \u201cI\u2019m an enemy of Olympus.\u201d\u201cOlympus?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYuWon explained his relationship with Olympus, from rescuing Hephaestus to fighting an Olympian Ranker.MuJin nodded along while listening to YuWon\u2019s story. \u201cI see. The \u2018Gigantomachy,\u2019 you say\u2026\u201dHaving been holed up in Mt. Heaven for a long time, MuJin had not experienced the Gigantomachy, but the tale was so famous, even he had heard of it.\u201cSo you\u2019re trying to stop that?\u201d MuJin asked.\u201cSomething like that.\u201d\u201cSo in the end, you\u2019re going to fight.\u201dMuJin\u2019s expression did not change. He was not phased by the potential threat of having to fight a giant enemy like Olympus.\u201cAre you okay with all this?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t avoid setting sail just because you\u2019re afraid of the tempest. There\u2019s no choice but to just face it.\u201dThis was good news for YuWon, but he couldn\u2019t understand. Technically speaking, he was an outsider to the Cult, yet MuJin was far too easily agreeing to a path that would be difficult for even blood relatives to face together. And he was going to take the Cult along with him.\u201cIf you can\u2019t understand, just remember this. Nothing else matters. There\u2019s only one thing you need to keep in mind as the Vice-Lord,\u201d MuJin spoke, explaining the reason why he had called YuWon here today. \u201cStarting now, you are the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201d* * *As the preliminaries of the tournament were ending, night had descended, and the ball began.\u201cThis year\u2019s Grand Martial Arts Tournament is another success. And it\u2019s booming more than it ever has!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because of all the promising people in the next generation. From an Olympian prince to a descendent of Asgard, an angel of Zion, and\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also Kim YuWon.\u201dEveryone was busy talking about the tournament while sharing drinks.At the ball, members of the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance chatted while congratulating themselves on successfully finishing the preliminaries without any problems.This was a gathering of the leading figures of the Martial Realm, so most of the Rankers of the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance were all in one spot.\u201cHe was really amazing. I finally get why everyone can\u2019t stop talking about Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cSame here. I heard he\u2019s not affiliated anywhere. If only I could have him join our Divine Martial School\u2026\u201d\u201cNow that I think about it, which martial school\u2019s test did he take?\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard? He\u2019s\u2014\u201d\u201cThe Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult,\u201d a man said in a sharp tone.People turned their heads in the direction of the voice to find a man drinking by himself off to the side.\u201cHead of the Sapphire Sword School?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while. But just now\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. What did you mean by the \u2018Vice-Lord\u2019?\u201dIt was already well known that YuWon had passed the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2019s test, but just passing the test and being the vice-lord of the Cult were two entirely different matters.Being the vice-lord would make one the successor of the Heavenly Demon. It was a position equal to a vice-head of a clan.It was hard for people to believe that he would have been given the role of vice-lord just from passing a test.\u201cI saw it with my own eyes, a Ranker of the Cult calling him the vice-lord,\u201d SoBaek said.\u201cDid something happen?\u201dThat was the question SoBaek had been waiting for.He paused to finish his drink, after which he said, \u201cWhile trying to greet a promising up-and-comer, he drew his sword on me, telling me to not approach their vice-lord.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could they do something like that\u2026?\u201d\u201cThey couldn\u2019t even let you say hi to him?\u201dPeople started to voice their dissatisfaction. The mood started to ripen, and SoBaek listened closely to what people started to say.\u201cThat\u2019s just how the Evil Cult is. It was like this long ago. The Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance and the Evil Cult are fated to never get along.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I mean, those cultists have such rotten personalities.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not familiar with it. What did the Heavenly Demonic Cult do?\u201d\u201cThis happened long ago, but since olden times, they\u2026\u201dThe public opinion of the Cult wasn\u2019t favorable.To people who had been wielding political power in the Martial Realm for ages now, the existence of the Cult posed a threat.On top of that, the older generations who had presided in the Martial Realm for a long time did not hesitate to call the Heavenly Demonic Cult the \u2018Evil Cult\u2019 instead.SoBaek had to hold back his smirk, speaking with as calm a voice as he could, \u201cAs you know, Kim YuWon is the strongest contender to win this tournament.\u201d\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t do\u2026\u201d\u201cHow dare a vice-lord of the Evil Cult\u2026\u201dOpposition broke out from everywhere. The resentment towards the Cult had not yet cooled in the Martial Realm.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we do this then?\u201d SoBaek spoke.\u201cWhat do you have in mind?\u201d\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201dA few of the Rankers of the Martial Realm leaned in to hear what he had to say.SoBaek composed himself despite his excitement, saying, \u201cIn the main stage\u2026\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Chapter 84After the preliminaries of the tournament ended, a two day break was given for the main stage of the tournament.During that time, players of the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance held their own meeting, similar to the ball held by the seniors of the Alliance.\u201cDid you hear the news?\u201d\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cOf course I have. How could you not? It was passed onto every player who made it to the main stage.\u201dOver a hundred players, the next generation of the Martial Realm, were gathered in a single place, eating food and socializing by a lake. They were all talented people who managed to get past the preliminaries.\u201cThe rules of the main stage suddenly changed. Has that ever happened before?\u201dA message was sent to players that passed the preliminaries relaying the new rules of the main stage and how the winner would be determined.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not common, but it was decided by vote among the elders, so I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a good reason.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cNo. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s it,\u201d one of the people in attendance said while shaking his head. \u201cI think this is related to the rumor that the vice-lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult is participating in the tournament.\u201d\u201cOh. That\u2026\u201d\u201cI also heard about that.\u201d\u201cSome were saying that the vice-lord of the Cult is Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cIs that true?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but he is the only one to ever pass the Cult\u2019s test, so it\u2019s possible\u2026\u201d\u201cBut still. Would they have given him a position as high as the vice-lord?\u201d\u201cIt adds up. It can\u2019t be a coincidence that they left Mt. Heaven as soon as they got the first person to ever pass the test.\u201d\u201cYou have a point\u2026\u201dThe people who were thirsting for gossip didn\u2019t pass up on the opportunity to talk about YuWon and the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cThen will the winner of this tournament end up being a member of the Cult?\u201d\u201cWhat a flashy comeback.\u201d\u201cI bet they were waiting for this.\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s why they gave him the role of vice-lord\u2026?\u201d\u201cHow shameless.\u201dThey were players of the Martial Realm, and the Grand Martial Arts Tournament was a major point of pride for these players. But the Heavenly Demonic Cult was the only organization on the 10th Floor who wasn\u2019t a part of the main society of the Martial Realm. There was not a single person there who would have been happy seeing a member of the Cult become the winner of the tournament.\u201cSo what about that?\u201d A sharp voice cut through the rowdy crowd.Everyone\u2019s sights shifted to the speaker.It was Hoon, who was enjoying drinks with his party.Hoon said while turning his head, \u201cDid the Heavenly Demonic Cult break the rules? Or did they use any underhanded tactics outside the arena?\u201dThere was not a single response, which was a given.What YuWon, the Vice-Lord of the Demonic Cult, had shown were indomitable skills, not some cowardly tactic.There was nothing to say in response.After looking around the crowd, waiting for a response, Hoon clicked his tongue and spoke again, \u201cUnless that is the case, you can\u2019t ostracize someone just for not being a part of the central Martial Realm. That is neither fair nor just.\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, then just stay out of it,\u201d said a voice familiar to Hoon.Hoon turned his head to see another rising star of the Martial Realm like him, a player of the Zhuge* Clan. He was also the one who first brought up the Demonic Cult at the party.*TL/N: JeGal has been changed to Zhuge to reflect the historical reference.\u201cZhuge JinCheon,\u201d Hoon said.\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? If you\u2019re scared, chicken out,\u201d JinCheon said.With a pretty face and snake-like slender eyes, JinCheon gave off a creepy vibe the longer you looked at him.Hoon did not avoid eye contact with JinCheon.They had never been on friendly terms ever since they were kids, but as they grew up, it only became worse, and now the two were nearly enemies.\u201cWhat, are you telling me to stay out?\u201dJinCheon looked around his surroundings rather than giving a verbal answer.There was already quite a large group of people gathered around JinCheon.\u2018So they\u2019ve already colluded,\u2019 Hoon thought to himself.It seemed that even before this preliminaries afterparty, there had been talks led by JinCheon, and this place was just a place for him to gather more people.\u2018His objective is probably Kim YuWon,\u2019 Hoon continued his train of thought.It was a longstanding, stubborn belief throughout the Martial Realm that there could not be a winner from the Heavenly Demonic Cult in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.This belief, of course, wasn\u2019t shared just among the younger generation.\u2018The adults changed the rules, and the kids will work together to stop the Vice-Lord of the Demonic Cult. Is that their plan?\u2019 Hoon hypothesized.And it was likely the center of this scheme was JinCheon.Hoon couldn\u2019t believe that they would go so far to defeat a single player. And the fact that the rules of the tournament changed meant that more than half of the guild was on the same page.Despite that\u2026\u201cDo whatever you want.\u201dRegardless of their schemes, Hoon wasn\u2019t really all that concerned. Before the tournament even started, the winner had already been determined.\u2018I don\u2019t really need to worry,\u2019 Hoon thought, resuming drinking, not seeing a need to waste his time on them anymore. \u2018They\u2019re going to get torn to pieces anyway.\u2019* * *The main stage of the tournament got delayed by a day, which naturally caused complaints.\u201cWhy the hell are they running a tournament like this?\u201d\u201cDo they think that the visitors have nothing better to do?\u201d\u201cThe Martial Realm is so washed up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201dBut on the other hand, there were also positive responses.\u201cI\u2019m okay with this.\u201d\u201cThe Martial Realm seems like they want to change, shaking up the tournament like this.\u201d\u201cI think this is going to be fun.\u201d\u201cA battle royale\u2026 That is certainly different.\u201dThe main stage of the tournament had been changed to a battle royale. It was a format where, rather than people fighting one on one, all the players would get in the arena all at once and fight simultaneously.The preliminaries were set up so ten players would fight at once, but ten wasn\u2019t that big of a number considering the size of the arena. In fact, their fights were underwhelming compared to how large the area really was.So the main stage of the tournament went from a traditional 1V1 format to a battle royale where a large number of players would fight at once.On the morning of the match, Hargaan had barged into YuWon\u2019s lodgings unannounced.YuWon was shocked to find Hargaan laying on the floor, snacking on some beef jerky.\u201cWhy are you here? What about your teammates?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cThey went out to have fun. Trying local cuisine. Seeing the sights. They decided to go nuts since today\u2019s the last day.\u201d\u201cAre they not competing in the main stage?\u201d\u201cYeah. They all decided to pass. They said there\u2019s no way they\u2019re going to win. It\u2019s pretty wise of them.\u201dUnlike most people, Hargaan\u2019s teammates knew about YuWon, and they had been closely watching Hargaan grow, so it wasn\u2019t a shock that they decided to give up now.On top of that, they didn\u2019t need to seek sponsorships since they were already a part of Olympus as Hargaan\u2019s teammates.\u201cIt\u2019s almost time.\u201d Hargaan got up after having checked the time on his player kit. \u201cLet\u2019s go already.\u201dHe looked excited.YuWon pretended not to notice, but he noticed that Hargaan had been glancing over at him for a while now. His eyes were filled with fighting spirit.\u2018I guess it\u2019s about time for a rematch,\u2019 YuWon thought while looking over at him as they left for the stadium.Despite not having seen most of the preliminaries, YuWon didn\u2019t rate the skills of the other players that high.There were some names of people he knew because they would become Rankers in the future, but most of them were only so-so. The only really notable name among them was NamGung Hoon.As for Hargaan, he was strong enough to be considered the true cream of the crop among them.Hargaan was silent the entire trip to the stadium, which was off considering his normally talkative personality.However, YuWon didn\u2019t think Hargaan\u2019s behavior was strange. He knew that Hargaan was slowly preparing himself.\u201cThere sure are a lot of people here,\u201d Hargaan remarked after seeing the massive crowd at the stadium.Not only were all the seats full, they even set up massive video screens outside, so people who weren\u2019t able to make it inside the stadium could still spectate.\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised by just this. On top of these screens, the main stage will also be broadcasted by the player station,\u201d Hoon said while approaching YuWon and Hargaan.Seeing YuWon for the first time in months, Hoon walked up for a handshake, \u201cIt\u2019s been a while. You remember me, right?\u201d\u201cYou have a face that\u2019s hard to forget,\u201d YuWon responded.Hargaan was shocked to see Hoon and YuWon greeting each other.\u201cWait, you know this guy?\u201d Hargaan asked YuWon.Hoon of the NamGung Clan was pretty famous among the players. That fame was bolstered by the fact that the Grand Martial Arts Tournament was hosted by the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance, which was led by the head of the NamGung Clan.YuWon nodded in response, \u201cWe took a test together.\u201d\u201cWe were enemies though.\u201dHargaan remarked with fascination after hearing Hoon\u2019s explanation, \u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re alive.\u201dTo some, being told that they should have died from meeting someone as enemies might have been insulting, but Hoon took no offense.Hargaan was right. Had YuWon fought him seriously, he would not be present today.\u201cName\u2019s Hargaan. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of me, but I\u2019m the great successor of Olympus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard quite a few people claim to be the successor,\u201d Hoon retorted.Hargaan\u2019s boasting was popped like a balloon, but instead of taking offense, Hargaan burst out into laughter. \u201cMy family is a bit of shitshow.\u201d Hargaan was only half-joking.Hoon knew he shouldn\u2019t laugh, but he couldn\u2019t contain it all.This friendly banter didn\u2019t last long.\u201c\u2014Attention all main stage participants. Please enter the arena now.\u201dThe announcement that could be heard even outside the stadium made Hoon\u2019s expression freeze.\u201cIt\u2019s nice seeing you again, but it seems like we won\u2019t have long to talk,\u201d Hoon told Yuwon.\u201cIs there something you need to tell me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not all that worried, but I thought you should still know.\u201d\u201cKnow what?\u201d\u201cBe careful just in case.\u201dWith his cryptic warning, Hoon turned around and went inside the stadium.\u201cHuh? What\u2019s he talking about?\u201d Hargaan asked YuWon, brimming with curiosity.But YuWon was also just as lost, though he decided not to dwell too much on it. He figured he would find out soon enough in the arena.\u201cLet\u2019s go in,\u201d Yuwon said while marching ahead.Step, step\u2014The two headed inside the stadium and saw the massive stage filled with countless participants.\u2018There sure are a lot,\u2019 YuWon thought.There had to be at least a few thousand people. The arena that looked bare when only ten people were standing on it now looked cramped.Everyone in the arena was a skilled player that had made it through the preliminaries where only one in ten people made it out. With over a thousand of such players, it was truly a sight to behold.Ssk, ssk\u2014YuWon noticed some discrepancies, but it was nothing major as it was just the \u2018gazes\u2019 of people.\u201cBe careful just in case.\u201dYuWon had a hunch of what Hoon\u2019s concern was.\u2018So that\u2019s what it is,\u2019 YuWon thought.He smirked a bit.If it weren\u2019t for Hoon\u2019s warning and the sudden change in the rules, YuWon would have just brushed the gazes off. But once he focused in on the gazes, it was easy to notice the fighting spirit in their eyes.A little over 100 players of the Martial Realm, or more specifically, players of the Martial Guild were showing hostility towards YuWon.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85Chapter 85\u201cIt\u2019s finally starting.\u201d\u201cWhat a spectacle. To gather all these players to fight at once.\u201d\u201cThis Grand Martial Arts Tournament is going to be remembered for a long time.\u201d\u201cThey should just take this chance to permanently change the rules.\u201d\u201cWhat a great idea!\u201dWithin the stadium, in a room that only special guests were invited to, the entire arena was easily visible.This was a place that only the Rankers of the Martial Realm who were holding the event could enter.\u201cYou did something great, sir,\u201d someone complimented the head of the Zhuge Clan.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We almost handed over the honor of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament to the Evil Cult,\u201d someone else chimed in.\u201cThat would have been especially bad considering how much interest there is this year\u2019s tournament.\u201d\u201cHaha! This is a great blessing for the Martial Realm!\u201dNamGung JinWoon wanted to cut his ears off from hearing all this bullshit, but he tried his best to hold himself back.Zhuge Jing was the head of the Zhuge Clan and the general of the Martial Guild.With snake-like slanted eyes and a face covered in wrinkles, he was smiling at the barrage of compliments.\u201cHaha. I didn\u2019t do anything. This is all thanks to the Head of the Sapphire Sword School,\u201d Jing said.\u201cThat\u2019s certainly true.\u201d\u201cHe did contribute greatly.\u201d\u201cWhen the match is over, I\u2019d love to visit the School of the Sapphire Sword.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome anytime. Hahah!\u201d SoBaek, the Head of the Sapphire Sword, said to everyone present.Knowing SoBaek had a close relationship with the Zhuge clan, JinWoon closed his eyes and thought, \u2018They\u2019re all rotten to the core.\u2019He knew that the Martial Realm had been slowly festering for a while now, and every time he acknowledged that fact, he felt like he lacked greatly.Zhuge was always at the center of the corruption, and despite being second-in-command in the Martial Guild, he had managed to amass greater influence than the NamGung Clan.That was when it finally came to JinWoon. The Martial Realm had become a place where one\u2019s way with words had become more important than one\u2019s skill with the sword.But\u2026\u2018The reason the Martial Realm became this way is because I am lacking,\u2019 JinWoon reprimanded himself.JinWoon then decided to use this tournament as a turning point for the Martial Realm.Slide\u2014The door opened.People were surprised, having thought that all the invited Rankers were already in attendance.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cAre we missing anyone?\u201d\u201cI thought everyone was here\u2026\u201dThe room with a premiere view of the arena was an exclusive space for the Martial Guild, the host of the tournament. So unless you were someone related to the Martial Guild, you could not enter.The Rankers in the room stared at the man that entered the room.The man was over 2.3 meters tall with a bulky upper physique and wore a red robe. He definitely didn\u2019t look like an ordinary person. And red robes weren\u2019t commonly worn by people due to how flashy they were.The man asked after looking around the room, \u201cAm I too late?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re just in time,\u201d one of the people in the room greeted him. It was JinWoon, who had been sitting in the corner sullenly.He got up from his spot to greet the latecomer.Jing stared at JinWoon thinking, \u2018What is he up to?\u2019JinWoon was the man that had made the NamGung Clan into what it was today. He was definitely not to be underestimated. And the guest that had just arrived was someone he had invited in secret.\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u201cYou look like you\u2019re from the Martial Realm, but\u2026\u201dThe Rankers of the Martial Guild inspected the man. He was clearly no ordinary fellow. He only looked 40 years old, but if he was indeed a Ranker, he couldn\u2019t be judged purely on appearance.If he was a somewhat well-known Ranker, at least one or two people in the room would have known his face or name. But not a single person there recognized him, which meant that he was a nobody.\u2018At best he\u2019s probably a martial arts expert from the boonies.\u2019\u2018What is he trying to do by inviting such a man?\u2019\u2018Wrong move, JinWoon.\u2019These were the thoughts running through the heads of the Rankers who felt unthreated. This was an inevitable reaction as the power dynamic within the Martial Guild had already shifted.Jing smiled slyly at JinWoon as if to say, \u2018We are at an age where words triumph over the sword.\u2019As the saying went, \u201cThe pen is mightier than the sword.\u201d And over half of the Martial Guild had now sided with Jing.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the late introductions,\u201d the late guest started introducing himself with a gentle smile. \u201cI came here because I was invited by the Head of the NamGung Clan. My name is Cheon MuJin.\u201d\u201cCheon MuJin\u2026?\u201d\u201cWait a second. Could it be?\u201d\u201cThe Heavenly Demon\u2026?\u201dEveryone\u2019s eyes widened, and the mood suddenly died off.A few Rankers went as far as to shift their hands towards the swords on their waists.\u201cYou will die if you draw that,\u201d MuJin spoke while staring at SoBaek.SoBaek had subconsciously grabbed the hilt of his sword.\u201cI can promise you that,\u201d MuJin threatened.Gulp\u2014SoBaek felt prickles in his throat while trying to swallow spit. His spine felt chilly, and the air was so tense, he felt like he was suffocating.SeBaek brought his hand back down.MuJin smiled. \u201cSmart choice.\u201dStep, step\u2014MuJin walked through the crowd, only speaking again after reaching the window from where the entire arena was visible.\u201cFrom what I heard, it seems that the Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult would have won. That would have been a real shame now,\u201d MuJin said, taking a jab at them.The gazes of the Rankers shifted away.They didn\u2019t know why JinWoon had called MuJin here, but they knew that MuJin wouldn\u2019t let things stand now that he knew what had happened.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d MuJin asked unexpectedly. \u201cDo I seem angry?\u201dRather than showing anger, MuJin had a gentle smile on his face.\u201cHahah! There must have been a misunderstanding. Not at all. Why would I be angry? Because\u2026\u201d MuJin said while looking down at the arena, spotting YuWon, \u201cyour hard-schemed plan is going to crumble.\u201d* * *The main stage of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.It was a battle royal where thousands of players fought on stage at once.As time went on, the tension in the arena thickened.YuWon glanced sideways and looked at Hargaan, who had been staying quiet with his eyes closed for a while now.Hargaan was preparing for the real fight.[Soon, the main stage of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament will commence.]A message appeared midair.A few players locked eyes with YuWon.They had been keeping their eye on YuWon as if they had some sort of arrangement.\u2018What a mess,\u2019 YuWon thought, noticing one of the faces. \u2018JinCheon. He must be the main perp.\u2019Zhuge JinCheon was one of the genius players of the Martial Realm, along with Hoon.YuWon remembered that he had become a Ranker in the future, but he also remembered him for having a rotten personality.[10]As the countdown started, Hargaan suddenly said to YuWon, \u201cI\u2019m telling you this now, but you\u2019re the only one who\u2019s a match for me, so don\u2019t you dare lose to someone else.\u201dYuWon could immediately recognize the sentiment in Hargaan\u2019s eyes.Rivalry.With his friend and goal in front of him, Hargaan was burning with motivation more than ever.\u2018I finally understand how he climbed so high so quickly,\u2019 YuWon thought.Hargaan\u2019s future had changed completely, and this change came from more than just the Tutorial\u2019s result. After having been the greatest all his life, he had been greatly stimulated by the appearance of a goal to surpass.[5][4][3][\u2026]YuWon felt obligated to respond.He drew a crude-looking sword on the ground and said to Hargaan, \u201cThat\u2019ll never happen.\u201dAnd he thought that Hargaan shouldn\u2019t lose to anyone else either.[1]The numbers finished counting down.[START.]Dash\u2014The tension that was at its peak snapped, and people started moving one by one.Klang, klang\u2014!Wham\u2014!Blast\u2014!Boom!\u201cDie!\u201d\u201cWhy the fuck are you going off on me?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how the main stage is supposed to be, man! You need to fight ASAP to get noticed as much as possible\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd that\u2019s how you get knocked out faster!\u201dThe first to move were the greedy players, the players that had already given up on winning and were focused on trying to appeal to the guilds within the audience.On the other hand, most of the players aiming for victory stood aside and assessed the situation.\u2018There\u2019s nothing to gain by wasting my stamina from the get-go,\u2019 one of them thought.But once the fighting picked up, it was only a matter of time until things devolved into pandemonium.Thousands of players became tangled up with one another.And amidst them all\u2026Whoosh\u2014!A knife flew towards the back of YuWon\u2019s head.Kkkrrr\u2014The knife was flung aside and scraped the floor.YuWon turned around to see a man wielding a sword shimmering with a faint color.[Arcane Sword,] or as they called it in the Martial Realm, [Ki Sword.]\u201cI know it\u2019s not just you,\u201d YuWon said while looking up.YuWon\u2019s blade drew an elegant curve and blocked the spear coming down at him from above.Klang\u2014!The attack had quite the force behind it, but the one that was shaking wasn\u2019t YuWon, who had blocked the attack. Rather, it was the spearman who had attacked him.Kling\u2014!After his ambush failed, the spearman quickly jumped back to create some distance.YuWon stood in his spot while looking around.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel too bad about this,\u201d JinCheon said, approaching YuWon while holding up his fan. \u201cThe Heavenly Demonic Cult and the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance are longstanding enemies.\u201dEven YuWon was aware of the bad blood between the Cult and the rest of the Martial Realm. Though it was now only remembered through records, it was both history and legend in the Martial Realm.Ssk\u2014Ssk\u2014One by one, players of the Martial Guild that were spread out across the arena slowly started shifting closer to YuWon.Because things had devolved into chaos so quickly, most wouldn\u2019t notice how unnatural of a sight this was.\u2018So this is why they changed the rules,\u2019 YuWon thought.He didn\u2019t know who came up with this idea, but it was a simple and effective plan. In a fight between thousands of people, there would naturally be fights where one person faced off against multiple people. And against a skilled opponent like YuWon, it was quite natural for people to team up.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to feel bad about,\u201d YuWon said while imbuing his sword with mana. \u201cYou guys are all small fry anyway.\u201dVwooom\u2014YuWon\u2019s sword was imbued with a much darker color than any of the Martial Realm players\u2019 swords in front of him.With an energy longer than a meter shooting out from the sword, JinCheon was shocked.\u2018So he\u2019s a bigshot for a reason, huh,\u2019 JinCheon thought.He wondered how high YuWon\u2019s Arcane Power was to have such a large Arcane Sword.\u2018It\u2019s got to be at least over 60,\u2019 JinCheon estimated.YuWon was clearly beyond the skills of a lower floor player.\u2018But\u2026 it\u2019s not as great as rumored,\u2019 JinCheon thought.The YuWon in the rumors was like an insurmountable wall. It was to the point that some were going as far as to say that YuWon might already be reaching the level of a Ranker. But now that he was going face-to-face against YuWon, JinCheon realized that YuWon was great, but not\u00a0that\u00a0great.\u2018This is doable,\u2019 JinCheon thought with a glimmer in his eyes.He finished calculating everything, and now that he was sure, it was time to enact his plan.Fwip\u2014JinCheon flicked his fan to open it, signaling the attack.The countless players that had been on standby rushed towards YuWon.\u201cNow!\u201d\u201cJump him\u2026!\u201dThat\u2019s when\u2026Crash\u2014!\u2026 A golden electric attack rippled through.The players of the Martial Guild that were charging at YuWon were knocked back and scorched black.In an instant, an empty circle was created around YuWon with YuWon being the only one unaffected by the attack.\u201cHey, weaklings!\u201d shouted Hargaan.He was the source of the electric attack, and he was baring his teeth at JinCheon and the other players around him.\u201cDo you guys have no shame?\u201d Hargaan asked.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Chapter 86The powerful impact of Hargaan\u2019s electric attack silenced the arena.\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\u201cHargaan?\u201d\u201cWhy\u2019s he acting like that?\u201dThe players around the arena continued to move while watching Hargaan growl at the players around him.They wanted to know what Hargaan was up to, but they were too busy crossing swords to be in any position to spectate him in peace.Klang, klang!Blast, boom\u2014!Swords and spears clashed around the arena amidst a flurry of skills exploding in chaos.JinCheon folded his fan back up, staring at Hargaan with a serious look on his face.\u201cCan I take it that you\u2019ll be assisting Kim YuWon?\u201d he asked.Hargaan raised an eyebrow and responded, \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cMy clan was thinking that we could form a good relationship with you.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s brain that came from, but that\u2019s a pretty stupid thought,\u201d Hargaan scoffed.JinCheon\u2019s face soured.This was an idea from the general of the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance, Zhuge Jing. And as a strategist, he was the one who had been leading the organization from the shadows.JinCheon couldn\u2019t stand for his father, who he believed to be great and intelligent, to be insulted like this.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, pussy?\u201d Hargaan asked.\u201cHow can you say something so tasteless\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because you guys act with no taste that I\u2019m speaking in terms you can understand,\u201d Hargaan said while looking around.He displayed clear hostility at the players that had been charging at YuWon just moments ago.\u201cWh-What\u2019s up with this?\u201d\u201cHow are we supposed to fight against someone like that?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a real monster\u2026\u201dThese players lost morale after seeing Hargaan\u2019s big attack.The mood had dampened, which was bad progression for JinCheon.\u201cW-Weren\u2019t we told that YuWon and Olympus were clearly enemies?\u201d someone quietly blurted out.But with his good hearing, Hargaan heard what the guy muttered.\u201cHow do you know about that?\u201d Hargaan asked.YuWon also heard it. He thought, \u2018So the Zhuge Clan even has ties with Olympus.\u2019This was new information for YuWon.He was aware that there was a power struggle in the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance between the NamGung Clan and the Zhuge Clan, but he didn\u2019t know that Olympus had a hand in it as well.It became apparent to YuWon that one of the reasons they decided to go forward with this plan was because they thought Hargaan would also fight against YuWon.\u201c\u2026 There\u2019s so much rot,\u201d Hargaan said bitterly. However, this wasn\u2019t a comment directed towards the Zhuge Clan but towards Olympus.\u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to unimportant details. Rather, decide now. Will you stand with or against YuWon?\u201d JinCheon said.JinCheon\u2019s words made YuWon glance over at Hargaan\u2019s back.They were currently in the middle of not just any public space but participating in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament. There were eyes of countless audiences directed at them, and on top of that, the tournament was viewable from anywhere anytime through the player kits. So whatever action Hargaan took right now, Olympus would find out.With YuWon being an enemy of Olympus, helping YuWon would be opposing Olympus\u2019s will.\u201cYou members of the Zhuge Clan always talk too much,\u201d Hargaan said while slamming his fists together. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you cut the useless chit-chat and fight me instead? Because I already made my decision long ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I see,\u201d JinCheon said while reopening his fan. \u201cI shall now face him. Quickly take down YuWon and come help me,\u201d he said to the others.Wind started to blow around JinCheon.\u201cWill you be okay?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to be going against Hargaan\u2026\u201dJinCheon\u2019s comrades voiced their concern.\u201cI know that. I\u2019ve also heard a lot about him,\u201d JinCheon said.He could tell from the attack just now how strong Hargaan was. He was stronger than any other player he had seen up until now.YuWon was called the greatest player, but having seen Hargaan in the flesh, he deemed Hargaan to be a step above YuWon. Despite that\u2026\u201cBut I am Zhuge JinCheon,\u201d he said confidently, assuring his comrades.That\u2019s right. He was one of the genius players who was set to lead the Martial Realm along with Hoon.And JinCheon\u2019s confidence rallied the rest of his men.But then\u2026Flash\u2014Vzzt\u2014In an instant, Hargaan was in front of JinCheon.\u201cWho did you say you are?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dBoom\u2014!Vzzzzzt\u2014!A punch flew at JinCheon, and he was knocked dozens of meters back. He couldn\u2019t even let out a proper scream as he flew through the air.\u201cKgh\u2014ah\u2026\u201d JinCheon grunted.\u201dSpark, crackle\u2014His body was electrified and scorched.It all happened in an instant.JinCheon tried his best to hold up his unsteady body. He gave his all to not lose consciousness.\u2018What\u2026 in the world\u2026\u2019 JinCheon thought.His mind and vision were hazy as he looked at Hargaan.He knew that a direct Pure-Blood of Olympus would be powerful, especially considering how Hargaan was the son of Zeus, the King of Olympus. It was only natural for Hargaan to be amazing.\u2018Still\u2026!\u2019 JinCheon thought while gritting his teeth. \u2018There\u2019s no way there can be this great of a difference.\u2019His pride had been hurt. At first, JinCheon thought it wasn\u2019t possible, but then his subconscious shouted at him, \u2018There\u2019s no way to win against this guy.\u2019\u201cYou should know your place, you nobody,\u201d Hargaan spoke while hitting his fists together.He had called JinCheon a nobody despite being from the Zhuge clan.\u201cDon\u2019t you dare try anything cunning,\u201d Hargaan threatened JinCheon while walking closer to him.Hargaan glanced over at YuWon to signal him.Step\u2014\u201cWe should continue where we left off,\u201d YuWon said while approaching the players of the Martial Realm that were circling him.YuWon had decided to take care of the annoying small fry before the real fight.* * *\u201cI-I give up!\u201d\u201cM-Me to!\u201d\u201cI give up as well!\u201d\u201cWell I\u2019m not giving\u2014ahhhhh!\u201dThe main stage event was starting to reach its climax.As time went on, their staminas wore out, and more players were forfeiting from injury. There were also players who refused to give up until the end, losing their lives.And in the midst of this chaos, JinCheon shouted while raising both his hands, \u201cI lost!\u201dFwoosh\u2014Hargaan\u2019s fist, which had been traveling rapidly towards JinCheon\u2019s face, halted. He wasn\u2019t the type who would continue attacking an opponent that lost the will to fight.Relieved at seeing Hargaan stop his attack, JinCheon said while letting out a sigh of relief, \u201cIt\u2019s my loss. I give up.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re forfeiting?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe fight hadn\u2019t gone on for that long. With his skills, all he could do was stop a few of Hargaan\u2019s punches. And even then, had Hargaan been serious, he probably wouldn\u2019t have managed to block a single one.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you tried to pull some funny business with your skills,\u201d Hargaan said.\u201c\u2026 If you hadn\u2019t stepped in, we would have been successful.\u201d\u201cDo you really believe that?\u201d Hargaan asked, looking at YuWon flying around amidst the Martial Realm players. \u201cDo you really think that you would be the difference in being able to defeat him?\u201dJinCheon remained silent. His silence was louder than words.\u201cAlthough\u2026\u201d Hargaan muttered while staring at YuWon.He was confused by YuWon taking them down one at a time by swinging his sword around.\u2018I don\u2019t think his skills should have gotten worse. Is he maybe conserving his strength?\u2019 Hargaan wondered.It had been a while since the two had seen each other.After the Tutorial and the events of the 1st Floor, Hargaan went through explosive growth. And he assumed the same would have happened to YuWon, considering he was now even rumored to be the strongest player ever.\u2018In that case\u2026\u2019 Hargaan thought while stepping towards YuWon, \u2018I\u2019m going to draw it out of him.\u2019Most of the Martial Realm players that were being a nuisance had been taken care of.Seeing how climactic the mood of the main stage had become, Hargaan thought this should be good enough of a stage.Stomp\u2014With each step Hargaan took, the ground caved in under his feet.YuWon, who was swinging his sword, put his sword down after noticing Hargaan approaching him.\u201cAre you going to start now?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cI\u2019ve waited long enough,\u201d Hargaan answered.His face was ecstatic.Vzzt\u2014A powerful current of electricity started enveloping Hargaan, as if he was ready to explode.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing sweeter than picking a fruit that\u2019s perfectly ripe,\u201d Hargaan said.YuWon could tell how much Hargaan had been looking forward to fighting him again. And now, no longer able to wait, Hargaan was getting closer to him.YuWon thought, \u2018There are still quite a lot of them left, but\u2026\u2019It didn\u2019t matter to him whether the true final fight happened now or later.Before getting in formation, YuWon decided to say, \u201cLet me ask you two questions first.\u201d\u201cTwo whole questions?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve waited a long time, so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s gonna kill you to wait a bit longer.\u201dHargaan nodded, \u201cWhat are they?\u201d\u201cFirst off, are you not going to regret your decision just now?\u201dHargaan had helped YuWon, an enemy of Olympus, and fought the Zhuge Clan, a clan allied with Olympus. That was showing blatant opposition against Olympus.\u201cI\u2019m not stupid,\u201d Hargaan said without hesitation. \u201cI know what results my actions will bring. I acted before thinking.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course I don\u2019t regret it.\u201dYuWon got the answer to his first question.\u201cAnd what\u2019s your second question?\u201dHargaan started getting more pumped up, knowing that they would be going at it at any moment now.YuWon was also getting just as pumped up.\u201cMy second question is\u2026\u201dVwoom, vwoom\u2014A beautiful-colored mana started enveloping the ash-colored sword.\u201cDid you already forget how I flung you away with a single punch?\u201dRemembering that incident made a vein pop up on Hargaan\u2019s forehead.\u201cOf course I remember.\u201dThere was no way Hargaan could forget it. It was the first time had ever lost to someone who wasn\u2019t a Ranker, and the shock of that moment was still as clear as day in his mind.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you something now,\u201d Hargaan said, now at a spitting distance from YuWon. \u201cDo I seem like I\u2019m the same as I was back then?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon answered.YuWon\u2019s answer eased the tension on Hargaan\u2019s face, but that didn\u2019t last long.\u201cYou seem even smaller,\u201d YuWon continued.\u201c\u2026 Fine.\u201d Hargaan\u2019s electricity shot up into the sky. \u201cLet\u2019s go then.\u201dFwip\u2014Hargaan got ready to swing his fist.YuWon\u2019s sword and Hargaan\u2019s fist were in reach of each other.YuWon didn\u2019t try to create distance, nor did he try to evade Hargaan\u2019s attack. He planned to take Hargaan\u2019s full electric punch head on.Vwoom, vwoom\u2014!YuWon prepared his [Arcane Sword,] which let out small vibrations.Crash\u2014!The sword and fist clashed together, sending out a loud ring across the arena.Crack\u2014From the impact, a tiny fracture appeared on YuWon\u2019s sword.\u2018This thing must be at its limit,\u2019 he thought.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Chapter 87There\u2019s an expression that goes, \u201cThere is always a higher sky.\u201dRumble\u2014Crash\u2014!That was what was going through the minds of the players participating in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.\u201cWh-What in the world?\u201d\u201cAre both of them really players?\u201d\u201cAre we sure they\u2019re not Rankers?\u201d\u201cG-Get out of the way! Or you might get caught up\u2014\u201d\u201cH-Huh?\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dCrash\u2014!Vzzzt\u2014The lightning unleashed from Hargaan\u2019s fists spread out across the arena, hitting the players nearby.The range of his attacks was so big, it was hard to gauge. Even people who thought they were a good distance away ended up getting caught in Hargaan\u2019s attacks.\u201cI give up!\u201d\u201cMe too! Damn it, I can\u2019t be here anymore!\u201d\u201cI forfeit as well!\u201d\u201cHow in the world do they expect us to fight and win against monsters like them?\u201dThe stage was no longer a place for other players.All eyes focused on the fight between YuWon and Hargaan, many seeing what happened to the people who got caught up in their fight, which caused more players to start forfeiting.\u2018So it\u2019s finally the real finals,\u2019 Hoon thought.Even Hoon felt miniscule compared to those two.He was bewildered, \u2018Hargaan\u2026 I\u2019ve heard his name a lot, but to think he\u2019d be at this level\u2026\u2019The best Hoon could do was muster up his ki to shield himself from the stray sparks of lightning.Hargaan was a genius that Hoon was frequently compared to. Because of that, he\u2019d heard of him time and time again, and before he knew it, he had developed a rivalry against Hargaan.But Hargaan\u2019s skills in person were far greater than what he had heard.\u2018Even if I had multiple clones of me, we wouldn\u2019t be able to win against him.\u2019With YuWon around, Hoon thought he\u2019d just have to aim for second place, but it appeared that he overestimated himself.\u2018But\u2026\u2019Hoon\u2019s gaze shifted from Hargaan to YuWon, who was barely stopping Hargaan\u2019s attacks.\u2018\u2026 Did he really defeat a Ranker with those skills?\u201d* * *Boom\u2014!Hargaan\u2019s punch made YuWon slide a ways back.YuWon\u2019s sword was ringing in agony, unable to absorb the entire attack. Scorch marks started to cover the blade.Bang\u2014!Hargaan didn\u2019t stop his movements.Spark\u2014Hargaan moved like golden lightning, instantly appearing next to YuWon.His Dexterity stat had to be incredibly high because his movements were so fast, it was hard to believe he was still a player who was far from becoming a Ranker.Vwoom\u2014Crash\u2014!Another loud ring rang through the stadium.Hargaan narrowed his eyes. YuWon did not get pushed back this time.\u201cYou\u2019re pretty strong,\u201d Hargaan said.\u201cYou\u2019re so nice with your compliments.\u201d\u201cBut it looks like your sword is about to break.\u201dIt was now plainly visible that YuWon\u2019s sword was on its last legs. There were fractures running across the entire blade of the sword, looking like a piece of glass that would shatter upon touch.Spark, crackle\u2014\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What have you been doing all this time?\u201d Hargaan asked.Vzzzzzzt\u2014!Golden lightning enveloped all of Hargaan\u2019s body.At the same time, the tip of YuWon\u2019s sword moved.Pshk\u2014Flash\u2014!Light exploded from the two.Crash\u2014!The sound of thunder echoed.Hargaan stepped back, feeling a warmth on his shoulder.Drip, drop\u2014Blood flowed down from his shoulder, hitting the ground. It looked like a pretty deep wound.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Hargaan muttered.He grabbed his wound with his hand and saw his palm get drenched in blood.Hargaan tilted his head up to look at YuWon, who was now flowing with electricity.The one who took more of the hit in the clash just now wasn\u2019t Hargaan.Vzzt, vzzzzzt\u2014A current was running through all of YuWon\u2019s body. There weren\u2019t a lot of people in the world who could survive taking an electric attack of this caliber head on.\u201cAre you alive?\u201d Hargaan asked.With a nonchalant look on his face, YuWon raised his head and answered calmly, \u201c\u2026 Of course.\u201d\u201cI thought that\u2019d be the case.\u201dHargaan raised his fist again.He was wounded, but YuWon should have been the one who took greater damage.\u2018His physical abilities are above mine,\u2019 Hargaan thought.Hargaan himself possessed excellent physical abilities. Because his Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution stats were high, he was confident in combat even without the use of mana.But if you looked at only physical abilities, YuWon\u2019s were far greater than Hargaan\u2019s.\u2018On the other hand, my Arcane Power is much greater,\u2019 Hargaan thought.That was the core of his strategy.\u2018Also\u2026\u2019 Hargaan glanced at the sword that looked like it was on the brink of shattering. \u2018Let\u2019s start by first breaking his weapon.\u2019Once he\u2019d decided on his objective, his movements became more decisive.Hargaan quickly closed the gap between him and YuWon again.His fists weren\u2019t aimed at YuWon\u2019s body. It was clear what he was going for as he pummeled YuWon\u2019s sword.Bam, blam\u2014!Crack\u2014!As if he was boxing, Hargaan threw a flurry of punches, cracking the sword more and more.\u2018Almost\u2026\u2019Clench\u2014Hargaan started putting more force behind his punches.\u2018Now.\u2019His eyes flashed while he stretched out his right arm.With a flash of blinding light, lightning exploded out from Hargaan\u2019s fist.Flash\u2014CRASH\u2014!It was such a loud and blinding attack, even the audience members who were sitting far away couldn\u2019t see what happened.But Hargaan was having an electrifying time fighting YuWon.Shatter\u2014!The sword broke apart like glass shards, scattering all over the place.Hargaan was sure of his victory.\u201cI did it\u2026\u201d he breathed out.With a calm voice, YuWon complimented him, \u201cThat was great.\u201dThe sweetness of victory quickly faded as Hargaan sensed that something was wrong. He should have been the one with the clear upperhand, yet YuWon thought he did great?Hargaan stared at him as YuWon threw aside the hilt of the broken sword without a second thought.And in that moment\u2026Vwoooom\u2014YuWon\u2019s mana started to push away Hargaan\u2019s electricity.\u201cWh-What the\u2026?\u201d Hargaan was bewildered.He wondered if this was what the Giants might have looked like. YuWon suddenly looked enormous in front of him.\u201cDo you remember,\u201d YuWon asked, clenching his fist, \u201chow I sent you flying with a single punch before?\u201dHis fist contained much greater strength than before.Whoosh\u2014As Hargaan perceived the punch flying towards him\u2026Wham\u2014!\u2026 He felt an impact against his face, and his consciousness started to fade away.\u2018Fucking\u2026 hell\u2026\u2019 Hargaan thought.Whoosh\u2014Boom\u2014!Hargaan\u2019s body flew into the air, and he shot across the arena.Thud, thump\u2014Hargaan rolled and tumbled across the stage, eventually flopping onto the ground.One was only able to see that Hargaan was still alive because he was trembling and twitching slightly.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\u201cWhat just happened\u2026?\u201dThe players still in the arena were confused.\u201cThe match isn\u2019t over,\u201d YuWon said while motioning his hand at them. \u201cI ain\u2019t got all day, so let\u2019s get going.\u201d* * *YuWon picked up the sword hilt off the ground.[Broken Nameless Sword]\u15cc Classification: Weapon\u15cc It\u2019s a sword made from various materials. Its mana conductivity is terrible, but the blade is well-sharpened. It could be useful for butchering.\u15cc Currently broken.It was the sword he had commissioned from Hephaestus. Not only did it not have a name, it was useless in almost every manner.There was only one positive thing about it.\u2018It really has the worst mana conductivity,\u2019 YuWon thought.This was the first time he had used it because the \u300cNameless Sword\u300d wasn\u2019t an item that was usable in combat.He originally intended on using it only until it broke.The reason he had it made was because there was no better item to use to practice controlling Arcane Power.Also\u2026\u2018That should have been good enough to fool them.\u2019Due to its effect of repressing Arcane Power, to the audience, YuWon and Hargaan\u2019s skills should have looked like they were on par with each other.There were quite a lot of players and Rankers from Olympus in the audience, and a few of them were Rankers that YuWon might have to fight one day.Considering how many eyes had gathered to watch the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, simple acting wasn\u2019t enough to fool Rankers.\u2018Though I am a bit concerned about that last punch\u2026\u2019It was an attack YuWon had launched because he thought he shouldn\u2019t drag out the fight any longer with a broken sword.YuWon raised his head to the screen above the arena.He could see that he was being shown on the screen, standing in the center of the arena. And on that screen, text popped up.[WINNER]YuWon then looked over at the players passed out across the floor of the arena.[KIM YUWON]Because he had fought using the minimal amount of mana possible, he was drenched with sweat.Hoon, rather than fighting YuWon, chose to forfeit. He said that it was because they had already faced off before, but YuWon guessed that it had more to do with how ashamed he was of the actions of JinCheon and the players of the Martial Guild.\u201c> The winner of the 834th Grand Martial Arts Tournament is player Kim YuWon!\u201dThe MC of the tournament was the 10th Floor\u2019s Lackey.They appeared while dancing in midair.The Lackey was a wooden doll wearing a tuxedo, which didn\u2019t really fit the Martial Realm. And on top of the Lackey\u2019s head was a small wooden box.The Lackey floated over to YuWon and asked him a question.\u201c> How does it feel to be the winner?\u201d\u201cIt was fun,\u201d YuWon answered.\u201c> Is that all?\u201d\u201cYep.\u201dA short and sweet answer.The Lackey had experience emceeing the Grand Martial Arts Tournament multiple times now, but even they had a hard time proceeding with such a lackluster response.\u201c> Ah, yes. Thank you for your answer. Well then, shall we present you with the prize?\u201dIt was the long-awaited moment.YuWon nodded his head and held out his hand. It was as if he was motioning the Lackey to give him his prize already and scram.Click\u2014The tiny wooden box opened, and despite being a good distance away from the box, a strong, bitter scent pierced YuWon\u2019s nose.It was a familiar scent to him.\u2018The Great Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u2019Inside the wooden box was a tiny, red medicine ball.As one of the items that represented the Martial Realm, this elixir was said to cost an astronomical amount of money and take a long time to produce. It was a heavenly treasure that every player and Ranker desired.\u201c> Yes. As you all are aware, the prize is the Great Scarlet Medicine Ball. The makers of the Medicine Ball, the Shaolin Temple, said that this one came out especially well\u2026\u201d\u201cThanks. I\u2019ll make sure to put it to good use.\u201dClick\u2014YuWon closed the wooden box and put it in his inventory. After this short exchange, YuWon turned away. He had no intention of listening to the chatterbox of a Lackey anymore.\u2018It\u2019ll take some time to digest it.\u2019The \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d was slightly bigger than he remembered, and to absorb all the Arcane Power held inside it, it would take at least a few days.\u2018As for over there\u2026\u2019YuWon\u2019s eyes turned to a section of the audience.\u2018I can probably leave them be.\u2019Cheon MuJin was on his way to settle things with the Martial Guild.NamGung JinWoon had reached out to the Heavenly Demonic Cult first, and the Cult had accepted his hand.As these were the two highest Rankers in the Martial Realm, YuWon had nothing to worry about. MuJin alone was strong enough to wipe out all the Rankers of the Martial Guild by himself.\u2018If the Heavenly Demonic Cult joins them, the Martial Guild\u2019s strength will basically double.\u2019The Martial Guild would become a guild that controlled an entire world as well as possessed a High Ranker. With the Heavenly Demonic Cult on their side, they would no longer be a mid-sized guild. They would then have the size and resources to push them into the territory of the large guilds.\u2018That\u2019s not bad.\u2019YuWon had only thrown a small stone, but the ripples it caused were about to bring great change to the world of the 10th Floor.The Martial Guild and the Heavenly Demonic Cult were two groups that had fought on the forefront of the war against the Outers. So their group becoming larger and more powerful was highly beneficial.Step, step\u2014YuWon hurriedly walked faster.It was now time for the 20th Floor. It was a world that rivaled the Martial Realm in size inside the Tower, and it was a floor where the tests started getting significantly harder.YuWon had a lot of things he had to prepare for everything he wanted to do in that world.\u2018To start with\u2026\u2019YuWon looked at the small wooden box in this hand.\u2018I\u2019m going to achieve my stat goal.\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Chapter 88The winner of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament had been decided.The room was so silent, it was suffocating. Everyone was busy gauging Cheon MuJin\u2019s mood.Zhuge Jing was racking his head harder than everyone else present.\u2018Why did Hargaan do that?\u2019 Jing wondered.Hargaan was most definitely a member of Olympus. As Zeus\u2019s son, there was no clearer indication of his affiliation and status.And YuWon was labeled internally by Olympus as an enemy.The only crossing point they should have had was that they were part of the same round of the Tutorial, but that wasn\u2019t enough to explain the relationship between the two.\u201cAnd with that, that\u2019s one big task finished,\u201d JinWoon\u2019s voice cut through the thick air.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards him, and few people let out an awkward laughter.\u201cHa\u2026 Haha\u2026 Y-You\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cThis tournament was also very successful.\u201d\u201cIt was a feast for the eyes.\u201d\u201cWhat great prosperity for the Martial Guild. Hahaha!\u201dIt was a much more exaggerated reaction than usual.The people who were worried about the Vice-Lord of the Heavenly Demonic Cult just moments ago were now saying that YuWon\u2019s victory was good for the Martial Realm.It was such blatant hypocrisy, it was funny.MuJin was expressionless as he watched this unfold.\u201cNow, that leaves the next big task\u2026\u201d JinWoon said while shifting his gaze towards Jing and SoBaek.SoBaek averted his eyes, while Jing stood even more upright.\u201cWhat do you intend to do by roping in the Evil Cult?\u201d Jing asked.The atmosphere in the room that was starting to relax a bit tensed back up.Jing and JinWoon stared each other down.The Rankers around them became uneasy. They knew the two didn\u2019t get along, but never had they had a direct confrontation like this.\u201c\u2018Roping in the Evil Cult\u2019\u2026 That\u2019s not a very nice way to put it, General.\u201d JinWoon berated Jing.\u201cAm I wrong?\u201d Jing retorted.JinWoon responded, \u201cThey\u2019re not the \u2018Evil Cult\u2019 but the \u2018Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2019 And I\u2019m not roping them in. I requested an alliance with them.\u201d\u201cDo you mean to say\u2014\u201d Jing tried to speak.But JinWoon cut him off, \u201cIt\u2019s better than roping in Olympus, isn\u2019t it?\u201dJinWoon\u2019s accusation made the people in the room clamor.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cOlympus?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, Guildmaster?\u201dThe air in the room had turned heavy and cold, and the room was now filled with mana exerted by JinWoon.\u201cMatters of the Martial Realm should be resolved by us, the people of the Martial Realm. Or do you intend to hand this world over to Olympus?\u201d JinWoon said in a sharp tone.His respectful mannerisms had all but disappeared, and he was now being verbally aggressive.JinWoon shouted, \u201cYou should be ashamed, Zhuge Jing!\u201dFwoooo\u2014!JinWoon\u2019s energy filled up the entire room.The lion that was pretending to be docile since becoming the head of the Martial Artists\u2019 Alliance had reawoken and was now roaring.Jing was one of the top five most skilled people in the Martial Guild. So he wasn\u2019t someone that could be intimidated just by pressure exuded by another.What Jing was truly afraid of right now wasn\u2019t JinWoon.\u2018He\u2019s been a bystander all this time. So for him to make a move now\u2026\u2019 Jing thought.JinWoon\u2019s behavior changed with the arrival of the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u2018Does that mean he knew all along?\u2019 Jing speculated.Jing thought it might have been possible that JinWoon might not only have known how he and Olympus were connected, but JinWoon might even have evidence to back it all up.There was only one reason why JinWoon had been biding his time, and that was because over half of the Martial Guild had been siding with Jing, so he wasn\u2019t confident that he could win a full-on frontal confrontation. But now\u2026\u2018With the Heavenly Demonic Cult and the Heavenly Demon on his side, the power dynamic has crumbled,\u2019 Jing thought.Not to mention, JinWoon held the moral high ground.Jing\u2019s shoulders slumped. \u2018It\u2019s over,\u2019 he thought.Seeing Jing not put up a fight, the Rankers that came with him also lowered their heads. They instinctively felt that now that the NamGung Clan and Demonic Cult were cooperating with each other, the Zhuge Clan no longer had a place to stand.It was now the age of the NamGung Noble Clan and the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cSorry to butt in while you\u2019re cleaning house, but I need to ask a question,\u201d MuJin said after looking around the room full of Rankers. \u201cWho is Moon SoBaek?\u201d* * *With Hoon\u2019s help, YuWon rented the NamGung Clan\u2019s training chamber.Just like the training chamber at Mt. Heaven, this was a facility that couldn\u2019t be opened from the outside.YuWon rented this place for ten days.This training chamber required a large amount of money to rent for even one day, but YuWon didn\u2019t have to pay any points.Hoon told YuWon, \u201cDon\u2019t look down on the NamGung Clan. Such a benefit should obviously be provided to the winner of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament.\u201d Great pride for his clan could be heard in his voice.Returning to the large manor of the NamGung Clan, YuWon had a flashback of his old memories.\u2018It looked so big back then,\u2019 YuWon thought.It was the first place he had seen that looked like a palace after he entered the Tower. Back then, YuWon\u2019s dream was even to become a Ranker of the NamGung Clan.\u2018But now\u2026 it looks so small.\u2019In the enormous Tower, there were many castles far greater than the manor of the NamGung Clan. Olympus, Asgard, and the Heavenly Realm each had a palace that was the size of a small nation.YuWon entered the training chamber and closed the steel door that was about 50cm thick.The space inside the chamber wasn\u2019t that large. It was about half the size of the training chamber at Mt. Heaven.Step, step\u2014YuWons footsteps echoed inside the chamber.All sounds were cut off from the outside thanks to the training chamber having been created with a mix of onyx steel.Click\u2014YuWon opened the wooden box right away, and a bitter scent hit his nose right away.It was the scent of the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball.\u300d[Great Scarlet Medicine Ball]\u15cc An elixir that is created once every three years at the Shaolin Temple. It is created using hundreds of ingredients and a special recipe known only to the Shaolin Temple.\u15cc When consumed, the user will gain a large amount of Arcane Power.The description wasn\u2019t all that special. In fact it was similar to most elixirs.The important detail was that it was made with \u2018hundreds of ingredients.\u2019\u2018As time goes on, the production method improves, and the value of the Great Scarlet Medicine Ball increases.\u2019Only one was made every three years, but this wasn\u2019t a tactic to artificially increase the value of the medicine ball. It was because the entirety of the Martial Guild and the Shaolin Temple had to work together just to barely create one.In fact, sometimes they were unable to procure the necessary ingredients, so the prize of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament would be substituted for something else.YuWon picked up the medicine ball with no hesitation.\u2018It\u2019s a 50/50 chance.\u2019His Arcane Power was almost at 100, so it was unsure if even the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d could raise his stat at this point.It might only have been 1 point, but going from 99 to 100 was no easy task.\u201cWell, I have nothing to lose.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t too attached to it since it wasn\u2019t difficult for him to get this item.YuWon put the medicine ball inside his mouth.Gulp\u2014The \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d had a strange feel to it. Even though it was hard like a rock, as soon as it entered his mouth, it melted like a soft jelly. And after fully melting into a liquid, the medicine ball had a refreshing coolness to it as it went down his throat.Fssss, fss\u2014A highly dense, clear mana started to enter YuWon\u2019s body.This was the first time YuWon was able to get the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d because in his previous life, he had only managed to get second place in the tournament.\u201cThe Great Scarlet Medicine Ball has a completely different effect depending on who consumes it.\u201d\u201cThe people of the Martial Realm say that how you control ki and your breathing and cultivation technique are important, but what really matters is your focus.\u201d\u201cLike how you can contain more mana?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dYuWon recollected what his friends who had taken the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d told him.The core part of their message was the same\u2014to \u2018contain\u2019 it.YuWon sat down on the floor in a comfortable position, and he started to contain the energy of the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d that had entered his body.But as soon as he did that, the energy of the medicine ball started to revolt inside his body.* * *Drip\u2014Sweat glistened on YuWon\u2019s forehead, and his blood felt like it was reversing in flow like turbulent waves.It felt like the energy would immediately leave his body if he lost focus for even a second.\u2018Calm down,\u2019 he told himself.The more will YuWon exerted, the more the energy fought back.At first, he struggled to manage it. With each little bit of energy he felt leaking from his body, he almost wanted to cry from how wasteful he thought it was. But as time passed, YuWon began to get a handle on containing the energy.Fshhh, fshh\u2014The waves that were rampaging inside his body started to die down a little.The medicine ball turned into Arcane Power and flowed through his body, but despite it becoming calmer, YuWon could not say the power was his yet.\u2018The first step is finished.\u2019The first challenge was to endure the power of the melting medicine ball and make sure as little of it leaked out as possible.The second challenge was to make the contained mana into your own.\u2018It\u2019ll take a while\u2026\u2019 YuWon thought while his brows furrowed, \u2018for me to absorb all of this.\u2019That was when\u2026Fsss\u2014\u2026 The medicine ball started to change within his body. The now liquid medicine ball unleashed pure mana at a rapid rate, and the mana flowed slowly like water and was absorbed into YuWon\u2019s body.Twitch\u2014It was the start of the second step.Fss, fsss\u2014YuWon\u2019s body started to quickly absorb the energy of the medicine ball.\u2018What\u2019s going on?\u2019Until just a moment ago, he was having trouble and barely containing the energy of the medicine ball so it wouldn\u2019t escape. But now that the medicine ball had fully melted into mana, he didn\u2019t need to exert any more force.It was as if the mana was obeying YuWon and becoming his of its own volition.\u2018Is this thanks to the Master of Mana skill?\u201dIt was something he felt everytime he consumed an elixir, but the [Master of Mana] skill had the ability to increase the effect of an elixir to the max. Thanks to that, it accelerated the process which would normally have taken much longer.\u2018If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u2019YuWon braced himself as he pushed mana through his blood vessels.Fsss\u2014\u2018I have no reason to do this slowly.\u2019The mana was waiting for him to make it his, and YuWon wanted exactly that. Not a single drop of mana was wasted anymore.YuWon sat still and enjoyed the pure, high-density mana filling up his body.Around the time the majority of the mana had been absorbed, YuWon thought, \u2018So was it just not possible?\u2019He had obtained a larger amount of mana through the \u300cGreat Scarlet Medicine Ball\u300d than he expected, but there was still no notification of his stat increasing.\u2018Did I fall short?\u2019While having only 99 Arcane Power, he now had more mana, but this meant that he ultimately failed to reach 100 Arcane Power.\u2018If even the Great Scarlet Medicine Ball can\u2019t do it, then next\u2026\u2019As YuWon planned his next course of action\u2026[Your Arcane Power increased by 1.][Your Arcane Power reached 100.][An innate skill has been awakened through this achievement.]A new level of senses opened up for YuWon\u2019s body.His eyes flashed and his senses expanded.\u2018I did it.\u2019There was no guarantee that two players would obtain the same power even if they reached the same level of stats. But the awakening of an ability through stats was a player\u2019s innate skill.Even if power was lost by returning to the past, the power didn\u2019t disappear completely. And the innate skill that YuWon had before returning to the past was a skill that was compared to OhGong\u2019s [Golden Cinder Eyes.][You obtained Sensory Field.]YuWon\u2019s eyes opened.His eyes had turned red. It was the [Cinder Eyes.]And along with it, an ultimate sensory skill that represented YuWon, [Sensory Field,] had been activated.With that, YuWon\u2019s broken wings had mended and began to grow again.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89Chapter 89The world of the 20th Floor was massive. Ironically, it was also a cramped place.The world itself was large, but there wasn\u2019t much space that people could live in. With 90% of the world being ocean, unless you were an aquatic race, you couldn\u2019t live on the 20th Floor.Of course, that didn\u2019t mean that the remaining 10% of the land was abandoned. In fact, it was the exact opposite.Despite it being only 10% of the world, the land was still expansive and bountiful, so the world progressed greatly.The Marine Kingdom, Portugia.In that kingdom, there was a legend\u2026\u201cHe who finds the \u2018Stone of the Sea\u2019 will become the god of the sea\u2026\u201dOn Neptu, one of the twelve islands of Portugia and the smallest of the islands, there was neverending fighting.\u201c\u2026 What an attractive legend. To be able to become a god just by getting your hands on it,\u201d the person continued.A dozen players were threatening a large boy and girl. The two were over two meters tall, and they were trembling while walking back into a wall.\u201cP-Please don\u2019t hurt us\u2026\u201d\u201cWh-What did we do wrong? Why are you doing this to us?\u201d\u201cHah! \u2018P-Please don\u2019t hurt us\u2026 W-We didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2026\u2019 Hehehe.\u201d\u201cYou should be ashamed of how cowardly you guys are for your size.\u201d\u201cAre all Giants li\u2019l chickens like them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hide yourselves now that you\u2019ve grown quite big, isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cThese li\u2019l assholes probably aren\u2019t even ten years old if we go by human age.\u201d\u201cReally? But they\u2019re this tall?\u201d\u201cThese creepy buggers grow to be at least four meters tall. Blegh.\u201d\u201cYou guys should have been good while Asgard was still helping you guys out. So why did you guys go and pick a fight with them\u2026\u201dAsgard and the Giants were originally on friendly terms. But after some Giants started working together with the Demons, Asgard cut ties with them. And ever since, these situations had become common.All sorts of crass comments were showered upon the two Giants.The two players walked further back into the corner, cowering in fear.\u201cYou know the legend I was talking about earlier?\u201d a red-haired man that was leading the group asked while walking closer to the Giants.\u201cWh-What legend?\u201d one of the Giants asked in response.\u201cThe one about the Stone of the Sea,\u201d the red-haired man spoke. \u201cWhere is it?\u201dThe Giants looked at the emblems on the players\u2019 chests. They were drawings of a red-maned wolf.They were members of the Crimson Wolf Guild, a guild infamous in the lower and middle floors.\u201cI heard that the Giants are hiding the Stone of the Sea,\u201d said the red-haired man.\u201cDo you really believe such a childish rumor?\u201d the Giant boy asked.The red-haired man scoffed in response, \u201cOf course I don\u2019t, but it\u2019s still the most plausible rumor.\u201d\u201cAnd do you know who the source of that rumor is?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it Olympus? They\u2019re as reliable of a source as it gets.\u201d\u201cThen I\u2019m sure you also know the relationship between us and Olympus?\u201d\u201cWe know. And that\u2019s exactly why we\u2019re doing this,\u201d the red-haired man said while reaching for his knife. \u201cOlympus will give zero fucks about us killing Giants.\u201dThe 20th Floor was a world under the jurisdiction of Olympus. Over half of the Bureau were Rankers and players of Olympus, and whenever incidents involving the Giants occured, they covered up most of them.This could only happen because Olympus wanted to eradicate the Giants.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then tell me already. Where is the Stone of the Sea?\u201d the red-haired man threatened the Giants.\u201cI told you, we don\u2019t have anything like that!\u201d one of them shouted.The other Giant followed up with, \u201cThat\u2019s a fake rumor spread by Olympus to get rid of our people!\u201dDespite the Giants\u2019 strong objections, nothing was going to change.Displeased from not getting the answer he wanted, the red-haired man picked his ear, saying, \u201cOh, really?\u201dHe then turned his head back towards his comrades.They were fellow guildmates that had been with him for a long time now, and each could tell what the others were thinking just by the look in their eyes.\u201cWell, let\u2019s see if you guys can still keep saying that later on.\u201dShing\u2014Shnnk, shank\u2014The players started to prepare their weapons and skills.The surrounded Giants grit their teeth. They knew that these guys wouldn\u2019t listen to them no matter what they said.The red-haired man instructed his men, \u201cDon\u2019t kill them. Just cut off their limbs one at a time. Then they might change their minds and\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat are villains doing, roaming around such peaceful times?\u201d a voice interrupted him.* * *The red-haired man was named Horang, an executive of the Crimson Wolf Guild. He turned his head, glaring, and saw that a man was walking into the alley.\u201c\u2018Villains\u2019?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s this asshole?\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t seem to know where he shouldn\u2019t stick his nose.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know who we are?\u201dThe Crimson Wolf Guild was composed of players from the 20th to the 50th Floors. And because the guildmaster was a decently high-ranking Ranker, they were well-known on the lower floors.\u201cHey, man! Don\u2019t try to play hero and scram unless you want to get hurt!\u201d\u201cAre you going to just let him go?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll get annoying if we kill someone that\u2019s not a Giant, especially with how vigilant Asgard has been lately.\u201d\u201cThose motherfuckers are always acting like they\u2019re goodie two-shoes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying.\u201dThe group had decided to ignore him, knowing that it was just one guy, but then the voice got even closer.\u201cI\u2019m not playing. I\u2019m the real deal.\u201dSsk\u2014YuWon cut through the group, saying, \u201cand I have business with them too.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIs this son of a bitch also after the Stone of the Sea?\u201d\u201cHey, be careful.\u201dThe members of Crimson Wolf became more alert watching YuWon walk through them. Even an idiot would realize that someone so bold had to have good reason to be so confident.\u201cWhich guild are you from?\u201d\u201cTell us. But whichever guild you\u2019re from, this isn\u2019t right, man.\u201d\u201cThere are rules even among us\u2026\u201d\u201cWait,\u201d Horang stopped his guildmates and just watched YuWon approach the two Giants.\u2018This guy. He looks familiar\u2026\u2019 Horang thought. He\u2019d definitely seen this face somewhere before.That\u2019s when it hit him.\u201cHey, is he\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you thinking the same thing I am?\u201dA few of the guild members started whispering. They seemed to be on the same page as Horang.\u201cKim YuWon,\u201d Horang said to YuWon. He spoke in his deepest voice and with the scariest glare he could muster. \u201cAm I right?\u201dYuWon nodded his head.After the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, the number of people who recognized his face greatly increased.Horang was one of them.\u201cDoes that mean we can just talk this out?\u201d YuWon asked.\u201cYou may be pretty skilled for the 20th Floor, but that ain\u2019t nothin\u2019. I get that you\u2019re amazing and all, but we cleared the 20th Floor long ago,\u201d said Horang.The majority of the players in the Crimson Wolf Guild were players of the 25th Floor and above.And Horang, being an executive, was a player of a floor much higher than 20. So to him, even if YuWon was the winner of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, he only saw YuWon as a player of the 20th Floor.\u201cAre you acting like this because you believe in the Heavenly Demonic Cult?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon said, turning to face the Crimson Wolf Guild while standing in front of the Giants, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in anyone.\u201dHorang furrowed his brow as he locked eyes with YuWon.It was just one guy. A player who only just arrived on the 20th Floor.Despite that, Horang couldn\u2019t look down on him. That\u2019s how much weight the name \u201cKim YuWon\u201d carried lately.Horang thought, \u2018There has to be a reason why he\u2019s acting so cocky.\u2019With YuWon\u2019s skills, he should have been able to join any large guild at any time he wanted.Horang continued thinking, \u2018We shouldn\u2019t lose to the skills he showed at the tournament. But what if he has comrades nearby? Or what if he\u2019s being escorted by someone from the Heavenly Demonic Clan?\u2019It was well-known that YuWon was the Vice-Lord of the Demonic Cult.So even though it seemed like there was no one else nearby, it was still a risk to fight him with only this many people on their side.\u2018It\u2019s a shame that we have to let go of some Giants, but\u2026\u2019 Horang thought it was risky with only twelve people, so he took his hand off his hilt and turned around.\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d Horang said.\u201cBut, sir!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s completely alone!\u201dHorang shook his head. \u201cWe\u2019re turning back, and that\u2019s final.\u201dAs a leader, Horang did not change his mind after making a decision. So his companions, after a bit of hesitation, left as ordered.\u201cYou\u2019re lucky,\u201d Horang growled, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for the Heavenly Demonic Cult, I would have torn you to pieces right here.YuWon looked at him who was looking back with bloodlust. Horang\u2019s eyes had turned yellow. His glare was fierce and sharp, like that of a wild beast.\u2018He\u2019s not a normal guy,\u2019 YuWon sensed from the intense mana Horang was radiating.It was strange to YuWon. He thought, \u2018Why isn\u2019t a guy like this better known?\u2019YuWon was familiar with most Rankers, and Horang was no ordinary player. With a fairly high position within his guild, he should have had the skills to become a Ranker.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d a loud voice spoke from behind YuWon.He turned his head.It was the girl Giant. It seemed that she had tried to speak quietly, but a Giant\u2019s voice was much louder than a human\u2019s voice.The Giant girl said, \u201cThanks for saving u\u2014\u201d\u201cWhat if I hadn\u2019t saved you?\u201d YuWon cut her off. \u201cWere you just going to take it?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re two Giants. You shouldn\u2019t be afraid of guys like these.\u201dThe Giants were a strong race. Born with dominant strength, they were on par with Demons and Draconians.\u201cSo why didn\u2019t you fight?\u201d YuWon asked.The Giant girl mumbled, unable to give a proper answer.The Giant boy cut in, \u201cYou must know Giants pretty well.\u201dHe was now much more alert, having realized that YuWon knew Giants better than the average person.YuWon nodded his head. \u201cA little bit.\u201d\u201cWho are you with? Olympus? Or Asgard?\u201d\u201cBig brother, I don\u2019t think we should be so rude to someone that helped us.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s still a human. There\u2019s no way he helped us without expecting something in return,\u201d the boy defended his actions to his little sister.\u201cBut still\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s right,\u201d YuWon nodded.YuWon looked straight into the eyes of the Giant boy who was a good two or three feet taller than him.\u201cI didn\u2019t help you guys for no reason,\u201d YuWon continued.\u201cSo are you after the Stone of the Sea as well?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThe \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300d It was an item that all players that visited the 20th Floor dreamed of.As an item known to turn one into a god, despite its existence being unproven, countless players and Rankers searched for it.YuWon was no different, except for one thing.\u2018The Stone of the Sea is real,\u2019 YuWon knew.Unlike the others who were on a wild goose chase, YuWon knew the truth and how to find it.\u201cDamn it, why don\u2019t you believe us?! We don\u2019t know where it is!\u201d The cries of the frustrated boy rumbled in the alleyway.The towering boy\u2019s muscles twitched as he told YuWon, \u201cListen to me. We really don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t even know if the Stone of the Sea is real, and even if it does exist, we don\u2019t know where it is!\u201d\u201cI know that,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cWhat?\u201d The boy was confused.\u201cYou guys don\u2019t know where it is, so of course you guys don\u2019t have it,\u201d YuWon explained.The boy furrowed his brow as he asked, \u201cThen what business do you have with us?\u201d\u201cI have business with a Giant that you guys know.\u201d\u201cA different Giant?\u201d\u201cUrpha.\u201dThe two made surprised faces at the name YuWon brought up.The Giants in front of him were only a few decades old. In human terms, they were only elementary schoolers. YuWon had no business with these kids.\u201cI\u2019d like to meet your elder.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Chapter 90The names of the Giant siblings were Buar and Nwiar. Buar was the older brother of Nwiar and had a rougher personality than his little sister. Nwiar was more docile in comparison, but she still had her guard up as well.Their answer to YuWon\u2019s request was a firm \u2018No.\u2019\u201cHow long are you going to follow us?\u201dStep, step\u2014YuWon followed the two circling around the back alley.This game had been going on for hours.\u201cI\u2019m sure eventually you\u2019ll go back to your people,\u201d YuWon answered.\u201cWe\u2019re going to lose you before that,\u201d Buar told him.\u201cI thought you weren\u2019t going to fight me?\u201dBuar was ticked. How could someone be so annoying?\u201cOr are you unable to fight?\u201d YuWon followed up.\u201cI can fight,\u201d Buar said bitterly.\u201cBig brother,\u201d Nwiar stopped Buar. She was worried that Buar might end up snapping and throwing a punch.Buar huffed a bit, staring down at YuWon, before he turned his head and continued to walk.\u2018He\u2019s holding back,\u2019 YuWon observed.Giants were naturally strong, but unfortunately they had a lot of enemies.With Olympus and Asgard, two of the top guilds in the Tower, as their enemies, Giants always had to watch their actions. If they caused any trouble, it would give Olympus an easy excuse to exterminate them by claiming Giants were dangerous.\u2018He\u2019s young but quite mature,\u2019The two siblings were big for their age.They were at an age where they might have had trouble controlling their emotions, yet Buar only growled while Nwiar tried to pretend like she didn\u2019t care about YuWon.\u201cWhat do I have to do for you guys to help me out?\u201d\u201cThe Elder doesn\u2019t just meet anyone. Go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not just anyone.\u201d\u201cAll humans are the same. That\u2019s what we were taught.\u201dThey had a deep distrust of humans.This was a unified belief among Giants due to the long pain they had suffered at the hands of humans.\u201cSo fuck off before you get hurt. Like you said, if we wanted to, we could easily crush a hoard of guys like you,\u201d Buar threatened.He was one of the Giants that not only didn\u2019t trust humans but despised them.YuWon wasn\u2019t going to get anywhere with just words.\u201cIs that right? Well then\u2026\u201d YuWon spoke, deciding he had to be more assertive. \u201cDo I just have to beat you?\u201d\u201cYou? Beat me? I doubt a scrawny bastard like you has the strength to do so.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome to test that theory out,\u201d YuWon taunted, extending his hand.Buar started to hold out his hand as well, as the two stared each other down.Nwiar quietly observed because she could tell that the two weren\u2019t going to fight just yet.Grab\u2014Squeeze\u2014Despite having a hand that was many times bigger, Buar was surprised when he grabbed YuWon\u2019s hand.\u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 Buar thought to himself.YuWon\u2019s grip strength was impressive, able to hold up against a Giant.They had only just grabbed each other by the hand, but Buar now understood why YuWon was acting so cocky.\u2018I\u2019ve heard his name quite a few times\u2026 but what is his strength stat?\u2019 Buar wondered.Buar himself was a player, so he was familiar with YuWon.He started to feel competitive. His pride wouldn\u2019t let him lose against a player that had just reached the 20th Floor.\u201cThen let\u2019s start\u2014\u201d\u201cWait, big brother!\u201d Nwiar stepped in.Buar looked over at his sister, annoyed at the interruption.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We\u2019re not fighting. We\u2019re just going to do some friendly arm wrestling,\u201d Buar explained.\u201cI can see that, but this is urgent.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a message from Elder Urpha.\u201dNwiar\u2019s words made Buar immediately let go of YuWon\u2019s hand.YuWon\u2019s interest also piqued at the mention of the person he\u2019d been searching for.\u201cYou messaged him?\u201d asked Buar.\u201cYeah. I thought I should at least let him know what\u2019s going on,\u201d said Nwiar.\u201cAnd what did he say?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Nwiar said timidly, turning her head to YuWon. \u201cThe Elder\u2019s looking for you.\u201d* * *YuWon followed Buar and Nwiar.The entire walk, Buar looked unhappy.\u201cWhat does the Elder want with a guy like him?\u201d\u201cHe is pretty famous.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s still a human. Not to mention, he\u2019s not even a Ranker or anything,\u201d Buar said while glancing back at YuWon. \u201cBut more than anything, isn\u2019t it weird that he knows the Elder?\u201dUrpha was one of the oldest Giants. He was not old nor ill, but he had been alive long before the days of the Gigantomachy, though he did not directly take part in it. And nothing was known about his whereabouts.\u201cI\u2019m sure the Elder has his reasons.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026\u201dBecause it was Urpha himself who called for YuWon, the two had no choice but to lead him through the forest.It was the only forest on the 20th Floor, a place known as the \u2018Giant Forest.\u2019Fweet\u2014!Buar whistled hard with his fingers as soon as they arrived at the forest.After a moment, the ground rumbled and a pack of beasts appeared.\u201cWoof, woof\u2014!\u201d\u201cWoof!\u201dIt was a pack of five wolves, but they were no ordinary wolves.\u2018Big Wolves.\u2019Big Wolves were humongous beasts that were more than two meters tall and ten meters long, and their presence was how this forest earned its moniker.The animals that resided in the Giant Forest were anywhere from a few times to dozens of times bigger than their normal counterparts.The wolves were growling and barking.\u201cThanks in advance.\u201d Buar signaled with his hand and some of the wolves became docile and lowered themselves.Buar and Nwiar got on top of two of the wolves, but the other wolves were still on alert against YuWon.\u201cGrrrrrr\u2014\u201dThey glared at YuWon, their guards up.Buar told the wolves who were baring their fangs, \u201cHe\u2019s not food, stop\u2014\u201d\u201cDown,\u201d YuWon signaled the wolves looking at him.In an instant, the wolves who were looking at YuWon lowered their bodies.\u201cArf, arf\u2014\u201dThe Big Wolves lowered their tails, and they even stopped baring their fangs and claws. They seemed to have lost their will to fight, afraid of YuWon.\u2018What the\u2026?\u2019 Buar thought, feeling whiplashed.YuWon\u2019s eyes had turned red, so Buar could tell that he was using some sort of special skill. But he still couldn\u2019t believe that YuWon was able to dominate the Big Wolves with just his gaze.\u2018Is it some hallucination skill? Or perhaps a druid\u2019s taming skill?\u2019Whatever the case was, it was clear the Big Wolves had surrendered to YuWon.The Giant Forest of the 20th Floor was an area that was off limits. It had a hunting ground that was dangerous for a player of the 20th Floor to challenge. In fact, that was the case even for players of much higher floors.Even Buar, a Giant, had a hard time taming his Big Wolf.\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d Buar asked.YuWon replied while petting a Big Wolf with one hand, \u201cThese guys are pretty smart.\u201d He turned his head to look at Buar and continued, \u201cUnlike someone.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Buar was stunned.\u201cLet\u2019s go already. We even found a ride,\u201d YuWon said while hopping onto the back of a Big Wolf.Buar was ticked, but he held back and commanded his wolf by patting it on the back, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWoof, woof\u2014!\u201dThe Big Wolf started to sprint forward.Buar turned his head back and saw that the Big Wolf Yuwon was riding was keeping up well.YuWon and Buar locked eyes, not avoiding each other\u2019s gazes.Buar felt his blood boil.\u2018I want to fight him,\u2019 he thought.Having been born a Giant, he was full of memories of players picking fights with him, but not once did he consider any of them a real opponent. It was like watching a small chihuahua bark. You let them yap and even bite you sometimes because they were harmless.Buar lived his entire life holding back, telling himself that he shouldn\u2019t fight. Yet for some reason, he couldn\u2019t do that with YuWon.He hadn\u2019t felt this great a desire to win in a while.\u201cBig brother,\u201d Nwiar said, having noticed what Buar was thinking, \u201cYou can\u2019t.\u201dHer firm tone made Buar turn his head forward again.\u201c\u2026 I know.\u201dDuring the rest of their trip, Buar used that time to calm himself down.In the end, they arrived at a large tree.\u201cThis is the place,\u201d Buar said while getting off the Big Wolf.Nwiar followed his lead and also dismounted her wolf.YuWon looked up at the massive tree that sprouted all the way into the clouds.\u2018Adam,\u2019 YuWon thought.\u201cWhat do you think? Isn\u2019t it amazing?\u201d Buar said with pride. \u201cIt\u2019s a tree that never burns or falls. The old folks call it a branch of the World Tree, but I don\u2019t really know much about that.\u201dThis was something that YuWon already knew because Adam was famous among Rankers. As the tree where the first Giant was said to have been born, Adam was a treasure of the Giants.\u2018A tree that never burns\u2026\u2019 YuWon mulled over that statement..He could clearly remember Adam burning down during the second Gigantomachy. It wasn\u2019t just the tree, but the entire Giant Forest had been reduced to nothing.\u201cWhat are you doing? Get down already,\u201d Buar hurried YuWon.After taking in the scenery, YuWon got off and followed Buar to a large tunnel near the roots of the tree.\u201cYou better start watching how you act from this point forward,\u201d Buar warned Yuwon.Stomp\u2014Loud footsteps echoed out of the tunnel.\u201cIf you\u2019re not careful, you might get stomped to death.\u201dYuWon nodded his head at Buar\u2019s warning.After the Gigantomachy, the Giants\u2019 opinion of humans hit rock bottom. They were taught to avoid trouble and fights for the safety of their kind, but exceptions existed, and not all Giants were well-behaved like Buar and Nwiar.\u201cFollow me.\u201dStomp, stomp\u2014There was no natural light under the tree, but there were shining crystals embedded all over the place, lighting up the inside as bright as day.This was the home of the Giants.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cA human?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re with Buar and Nwiar.\u201d\u201cIs it a guest?\u201d\u201cNo way. A human guest?\u201dThe Giants they walked past all whispered as they looked at YuWon.Most of them had powers close to that of a Ranker. And every single one of them was on guard against YuWon.\u201cIgnore them,\u201d Nwiar quietly whispered to Yuwon. \u201cYou\u2019re a guest of the Elder, so you have nothing to be afraid of.\u201dIt would be natural for anyone to be afraid in this situation. He had entered a Giants\u2019 den, and there was no Giant that would welcome a human with the current circumstances.\u201cHey, Buar,\u201d a Giant that appeared to be around the two siblings\u2019 age approached them.He had wide shoulders and sharp eyes.\u201cWhen did you get back?\u201d the Giant asked Buar.\u201cJust now,\u201d he answered while stepping in front of YuWon.It was as if he was trying to hide YuWon with his size.He asked with a smiling face, \u201cHow\u2019s climbing the Tower? I heard you climbed quite high.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on the 49th Floor now.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty fast. Did you come back to rest?\u201d\u201cYeah, and to say hi to the Elders.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dThe conversation up until now felt like just formalities.The Giant then peeked his head around Buar and glared at YuWon, \u201cNow\u2026 What\u2019s with this ant?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This is not a notice saying that we are dropping the novel, so you can rest easy.I wanted to give an update on the status of the project, as I think it is the least that the community that\u2019s supported us on the project deserves.Not to bore you all with the details, but I\u2019ve been experiencing both physical and mental health problems, which have been the primary cause of the delay in updates.As the sole translator from chapter 1 to almost now chapter 100, I am incredibly attached to this project, pouring a great among of love, care, and attention to every word to bring you guys the best possible translation of the novel, but that level of dedication has also been poisonous to the mind.I\u2019ve spent the past few months working on self-care so that I don\u2019t experience the same kind of burnout that\u2019s been stalling the project, while also try and maintain a level of quality that I am proud of.I realize that this update is greatly delayed, but it is terrifying and nerve-wrecking to speak publicly about my personal problems to the countless people who read the novel, especially a problem that\u2019s as heavily judged as mental illness.I will be trying to get back to at least 3 ch/week and work myself up to try and translate 5 ch/week if possible. I\u2019m currently working on building up a backlog, so even if I do have a bad week or month, the series won\u2019t completely dry up with updates.Once again, thank you for being patient with me and for supporting this project greatly,NumbaWonPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a degrading nickname used by Giants to refer to humans.It was a word that anyone would find unpleasant being called, even if they didn\u2019t know the meaning, but one would have to be an idiot to not comprehend that it meant something negative.\u201cKwant,\u201d Buar glared at the Giant standing in front of him. \u201cWatch your tongue.

Sorry, sorry,\u201d Kwant spoke with a joking tone as he walked past Buar.As Kwant walked by, he locked eyes with YuWon. Towering more than a meter over him, Kwant looked down at YuWon with distaste but left without doing anything.Buar glared at Kwant\u2019s back, grumbling with a frustrated tone, \u201cYou fucking bastard\u2026\u201d\u201cBig brother, calm down.

He then looked over at YuWon, who was laughing, and asked irritably, \u201cWhy are you laughing?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s funny.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you scared? No one here likes that you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cSo? It\u2019s not like you guys like me either,\u201d YuWon said nonchalantly.\u201cI guess you have a point,\u201d Buar nodded his head as he started walking again. \u201cWhatever. Just follow me. Also, you\u2019re frustratingly slow, so pick up the pace.\u201dBuar had been walking slower to match YuWon\u2019s walking speed.YuWon followed Buar while being in the spotlight of the Giants\u2019 gazes.\u2018I guess I\u2019m not very welcome,\u2019 YuWon thought.Currently, the Giants were in a crisis, like a candle facing a gust of wind. That\u2019s why everyone was so on edge.\u2018It\u2019ll be annoying if a lot of them are like the guy just now.\u2019The Giant named Kwant openly picked a fight against YuWon. If it weren\u2019t for Buar and Nwiar, and if not for the fact that he was a guest of the Elder, a fight would have broken out.\u201cHere,\u201d Buar pointed to the giant wooden door they had arrived at.The door was about ten meters in height, and they felt like the doors of a dungeon boss room.Of course, in reality, it was just a normal door.\u201cElder, are you there?\u201d Buar asked in a careful, soft tone, starkly in contrast to his behavior up to this point.A reply came after a moment, \u201c\u2026 Come on in.\u201dCreak\u2014The door opened on its own, pushed by the wind that flowed out from inside.Buar stepped aside for a moment because, regardless of the circumstances, YuWon was Urpha\u2019s guest.Step, step\u2014It was a tall, wide room. In fact, from YuWon\u2019s perspective, it felt more like a large cave rather than a room.YuWon\u2019s footsteps sounded tiny inside this space.It had finally sunk in that he was in the land of the Giants.There was a bed, rocking chair, table, nightstand, and other furniture that were multiple times bigger than YuWon\u2019s height\u2026 Some objects were dozens of times larger than their human-sized counterparts.These objects made Nwiar and Buar not even seem like Giants, but just slightly tall humans.Creak\u2014\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dYuWon looked over at the Giant sitting on a rocking chair with a baby Big Wolf on his lap.He spoke in a soft voice, but his voice still echoed around the room, \u201cWhat was your name again? I\u2019m getting up there in age, so my memory isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201dThe Giant had wrinkles all over his face. He was a very old-looking Giant.It was said that when you became a Ranker, you no longer aged. Despite that, this Giant appareard ancient.The reason for this was because Urpha entered the tower at an already old age. He was the living, breathing history of the Giants.\u201cMy name is Kim YuWon,\u201d YuWon greeted politely, a rare action for him.All things aside, Urpha was a being that deserved respect, considering his achievements while leading the Giants.\u201cAlright, YuWon. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you.\u201d\u201cWhere did you hear about me?\u201d\u201cFrom Hephaestus. That brat can\u2019t stop talking about you.\u201dYuWon nodded his head at Urpha\u2019s answer.He\u2019d had an inkling from the moment Nwiar said that Urpha was looking for him. Hephaestus was the only route through which Urpha, the Elder of the Giants, would know about him.\u201cSo, you\u2019re fighting against Olympus?\u201d Urpha asked.\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\u201cFor a kid that\u2019s not even a Ranker yet and who\u2019s just arrived on the 20th Floor to do so. That\u2019s quite amazing.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s not bravery. It\u2019s recklessness and nothing more.\u201dYuWon, who had his head lowered, looked up at Urpha.Urpha\u2019s narrow eyes were open. And his eyes were incredibly clear for an old man that was ill and aging away on a rocking chair.\u201cIf you value your life, give up. Even a light sneeze from them can send you flying away.\u201dUrpha was right. YuWon wasn\u2019t that strong yet. YuWon was a single drop of water, but Olympus was a forest fire. He was no match for them\u2026 at least for now.\u201cI had heard that you were a pacifist\u2026\u201d YuWon said in disappointment, \u201cBut is it that you\u2019re actually just a coward?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRumble, rumble\u2014The room shook.The mana in the air trembled, pressing down on YuWon\u2019s shoulders.It was a considerable weight. The density and pressure of the mana was abnormal.Even at his age, he was still a High Ranker.\u201cYou\u2019re yapping without thinking things through,\u201d said Urpha.\u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already heard, but Olympus is once again preparing for the Gigantomachy,\u201d YuWon spoke, disregarding Urpha\u2019s anger. \u201cAre you just going to sit by and wait for the annihilation of your race?\u201dThud\u2014!The weight of the mana increased manyfold. YuWon\u2019s feet dug more than ten centimeters into the ground.Urpha silently looked down at YuWon. He was in awe. Despite using a tremendous amount of that mana, YuWon was still resisting.And that wasn\u2019t the only thing happening.\u2018The mana is rejecting my command,\u2019 Urpha noticed.The mana that should have been moving according to his will was trying to resist harming YuWon.It was unknown to Urpha if YuWon was aware of this or not, but YuWon continued to stare up at him, looking him in the eyes.There was no fear or wavering.Fwooo\u2014Fss, fss\u2014The threatening flow of mana that was filling the room slowly calmed.YuWon dusted off his shoulders. Because of the effect of the heavy gravity, a lot of dust had fallen down.\u201cIt\u2019s as I heard. You\u2019re fearless,\u201d Urpha spoke in a different tone.The oppressive tone from before was gone, and there was a warm look now in his clear eyes.This was Urpha\u2019s face without any masks.\u201cYou\u2019re right. At this rate, we\u2019ll be annihilated.\u201dUrpha had already received the news from Hephaestus.Hephaestus had long maintained a secret relationship with the Giants, so of course Urpha was notified of Olympus\u2019s actions.It was already fairly well-known that Olympus was preparing the next Gigantomachy.\u201cI wonder how much time there is left. 100 years? 10 years?\u201d Urpha said with sadness in his eyes. \u201cIt could even be tomorrow.\u201dHe had chosen peace to protect his people, but he was also aware that peace didn\u2019t always lead to talks.\u201cI really have heard a lot about you. Not just from Hephaestus, but also from the children climbing up.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cAlso, Hephaestus, that kid, strongly recommended you.\u201dYuWon\u2019s eyes lit up. He thought maybe this would go easier than he expected.In fact, Urpha ended up bringing it up first. \u201cSo you\u2019re searching for the Stone of the Sea?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt does indeed exist, but unlike the rumors, we do not possess it.\u201dThis was a surprise for YuWon. He had expected that he was called here because Urpha had heard he was searching for it, but to think Urpha would so easily share their secrets.\u201cBut we do know where it is.\u201d\u201cWhy are you telling me this?\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t doubt the credibility of Urpha\u2019s words. He came here knowing that Urpha knew about the \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300dHe was curious why Urpha was so willingly telling him everything.\u201cI have two reasons.\u201dUrpha wasn\u2019t sharing this information just for the hell of it.\u201cFirst, it\u2019s because you are without a doubt not affiliated with Olympus.\u201dHephaestus vouching for YuWon played a big role here. Hephaestus told Urpha that YuWon fought and rescued him from Olympus, severely delaying the second Gigantomachy.There was no better way to prove that YuWon was not a part of Olympus.\u201cAs for the second reason\u2026\u201d Urpha looked over at \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d in YuWon\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s because you\u2019re the strongest player of this era.\u201d* * *YuWon was provided a room that was way too big for his size.He might have been a human, but Urpha was an Elder of the Giants. Under his orders, Yuwon was able to at least receive treatment as a guest.Creak, creak\u2014Urpha continued rocking on his chair with the Big Wolf on his lap.Darkness set in the forest as the night grew deeper, and Urpha\u2019s eyes slowly closed.He had a hazy dream. A nightmare.\u201cRun!\u201d\u201cThis way. Hurry!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stop them, so\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn Olympus bastards!\u201d\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dAngry roars and screams echoed into the sky.The sharp scent of blood filled the air, and the ground became tainted red.Urpha stood at the center of all this, staring at the dead corpses of Giants.Whoosh\u2014The sea rose up into the sky.Giants screamed watching the sea rise like it was alive.\u201cIt\u2019s a tsunami!\u201d\u201cThe God of the Sea is here!\u201dThe God of the Sea. He was one of the Big Three gods of Olympus and a top High Ranker.A massive tsunami swept up the Giants.The force of the tsunami crushed their bodies and dragged their corpses deep into the sea.On top of the tsunami that had consumed countless Giants, a man with blue hair appeared.\u2018Poseidon.\u2019 Urpha thought, locking eyes with the god far in the distance.Urpha remembered this moment vividly.He was afraid.It was shameful, but he wasn\u2019t able do anything because of his fear.Ssk\u2014Urpha opened his eyes.He couldn\u2019t remember how many times he\u2019d had that dream now.The nightmare of the past would make him jolt awake in cold sweat.Arf, arf\u2014The Big Wolf whimpered, worried about its owner\u2019s condition.\u201cI\u2019m alright. I\u2019m alright\u2026\u201d Urpha said while petting the Big Wolf\u2019s back. He then turned his head to the window.He remembered the events of that day more than usual.The Giants that died to the huge monster called the sea. The eternal enemy of Giants, capable of wiping out an entire battlefield alone.\u201cThings won\u2019t go the way you want\u2026\u201d Urpha said, standing up in the early morning while recalling the events of that day, \u201c\u2026 Poseidon.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Besides, we should be thankful that it\u2019s a permanent, full-time position,\u201d the coworker sitting opposite him said while moving a chess piece.Tak\u2014If they didn\u2019t have at least this, time felt like it would never move.Howl scanned over the chessboard.\u201cHmm\u2026 Let\u2019s see\u2026\u201d he thought out loud for a brief moment. \u201cI\u2019ll\u2014\u201dBang, bang\u2014!Right before he was about to move a piece, someone started banging on the door.\u201cWho is it?\u201dCreak\u2014\u201cExcuse me,\u201d the guest that banged on the door barged in.It was a mean-looking man with red hair.Howl squinted while looking over at the man. \u201cHorang?\u201d he said.It was one of the faces he saw a lot after being appointed on the 20th Floor.The regulars fell into one of two groups. They were either serious criminals, or they had such a reliable sponsor that they could walk in and out of the Bureau like it was their house.Horang was someone that fell within both groups.\u201cWhy are you here? Did you cause trouble again?\u201d asked Howl.\u201cNo, that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cThen why did you come here? Everyone\u2019s acting carefully because things are serious right now.\u201dHorang walked over to the sofa set the two were sitting at, and he sat down without asking before answering, \u201cI found two rabbits.\u201d\u201cRabbits? Which ones are we talking about?\u201d\u201cGiants and Kim YuWon.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Howl\u2019s eyes widened.He had been observing the Giants\u2019 movements. And now YuWon was with them.\u201cWell, actually there are two Giants, so I guess I should say there are three rabbits. Anyway, some pretty dangerous guys have met up,\u201d Horang said.He then said with a creepy smile, \u201cAnd we at Olympus happened to discover them.\u201dHorang was technically not part of Olympus. Instead, he was an executive of the Crimson Wolf Guild, a somewhat famous guild on the middle floors. But there were rumors that a bigshot in Olympus was backing him.\u201cBecause of that, I\u2019ll need some assistance,\u201d Horang said.This wasn\u2019t a request one would normally ask the Bureau, asking for support to get some players.The problem here, though, was that Howl and the other Rankers in the Bureau didn\u2019t have a problem with him making a request to hunt players.\u201cBut he only just arrived on the 20th Floor.\u201d\u201cNo. You shouldn\u2019t judge YuWon by what floor he\u2019s on. I saw him fight in the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, and he was no joke.\u201d\u201cYou think?\u201d\u201cI think Hargaan did lower his guard at the end, but the guy still knocked him out with a single punch.\u201d\u201cI guess you have a point.\u201d\u201cAlso, it\u2019ll be hard with two Giants accompanying him. Not to mention, he might have the backing of the Heavenly Demonic Cult\u2026\u201dThey two had a short debate about combat strength, calculating the variables that were YuWon and the Heavenly Demonic Cult.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI guess as long as we can get him\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d be promoted at least one rank.\u201dThe Rankers spoke with smiles on their faces.And thus, a secret talk started in the tiny room at the Bureau.* * ** * *Adam was basically a small city.The trunk and branches that rose into the sky were the homes of Giants.An indestructible tree.With the exception of High Rankers on the level of the \u201cBig Three\u201d gods of Olympus or the Ruyi Jingu of Son OhGong, one couldn\u2019t even scratch Adam.Naturally, that meant YuWon couldn\u2019t harm the tree with his current abilities.\u2018I can go buck wild.\u2019Step\u2014YWon got on top of a branch of Adam.The floor was hard, and there was far more than sufficient space for him to go wild.Fwoosh\u2014Flicker, flicker\u2014Above YuWon\u2019s head, hundreds of fist-sized flames of [Holy Fire] appeared.Whoosh\u2014!The [Holy Fire] burned violently, having now escaped YuWon\u2019s control. They\u2019d soon start falling randomly towards the ground.Phew\u2014YuWon let out a deep breath as his eyes changed.[Cinder Eyes reads the path.]Among the many abilities of [Cinder Eyes,] one of the main ones was reading \u2018paths.\u2019There were many kinds of paths, but a major one was \u2018evasion.\u2019 By using this ability, YuWon could see where the fire would fall, read the path, and move a few beats faster.\u2018This is making me dizzy.\u2019It had been quite some time since he had started using [Cinder Eyes,] but whenever he used it, he still felt the overload. Especially at times like this when he was reading an especially difficult path to evade.Beeeeep\u2014His brain started to overload, but this still wasn\u2019t enough for him to read the paths of a hundred flames.[Activating Sensory Field.][Checking the data of all objects and life forms within a 50m radius.][Perception increases by 50%.][Sensory Field.] Among the new skills YuWon obtained, it was the skill he was most familiar with. It was similar to [Cinder Eyes,] but it was much more effective. This wasn\u2019t because [Sensory Field] was a better skill, it was simply because he was much more familiar with it.YuWon closed his eyes.Fwoosh\u2014YuWon could feel the fires that had escaped his control burning ferociously. The sensation of which direction they were going to fall towards and how powerful they were tingled over his skin.That was the power of [Sensory Field.]Within the field, YuWon\u2019s senses multiplied manyfold.He opened his eyes, and his vision through [Cinder Eyes] became imbued with the power of [Sensory Field.]Fwoosh\u2014!YuWon\u2019s red eyes opened wide.There was only a single thought running through YuWon\u2019s mind.\u2018So, the world can look this clear.\u2019He saw where each flame was going to move and how he should move himself. Everything was visibly clear.Whoosh\u2014The balls of fire finally started to fall.One by one, the flames of [Holy Fire] began to rain down. In just a few seconds, they all started descending together.Boom, kaboom\u2014!Fwoosh\u2014!The fires fell on a branch of Adam, and the flames rose up. That branch became tinged in the purple light of the flames.But among that inferno, a small space no bigger than one meter wide opened up.In the sole space where there was no fire, YuWon landed.Phew\u2014He managed to evade everything he saw. In fact, YuWon thought it might have been possible to dodge everything even with his eyes closed.He had started practicing with [Sensory Field] consistently as soon as he got it, and he observed that the proficiency was growing faster than normal.\u2018The two skills synergize well like I thought they would.\u2019The combined effects of the two skills were multiple times greater than their sole effects, but the downside was that, as effective as it was, it was also that much more taxing.\u2018My brain can\u2019t keep up with the sensory information.\u2019Expanded vision as well as other senses overloaded the brain greatly.He had a lot of experience using [Sensory Field,] but [Cinder Eyes] was a relatively newer skill for him, even though in this life, he had been substituting [Sensory Field] with [Cinder Eyes.]Now he had both skills and the ability to use them in tandem, but that meant an even greater load on his brain.\u2018I\u2019ll need some practice.\u2019He decided he\u2019d likely be busy with this for a while.\u201cWhoa. What\u2019s this? You were here?\u201d an exaggerated voice suddenly cut in.YuWon turned his head and noticed a familiar face.\u201cHuh? It\u2019s a human?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s a human doing here?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? Elder Urpha gave him permission to stay.\u201d\u201cThe Elder did that?\u201d\u201cStill, to let a human\u2026\u201dKwant and four other Giants spoke to each other.They were around the size of Buar and Nwiar, meaning they were young Giants.\u201cIs Kim YuWon really that amazing?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I only ever heard the humors.\u201d\u201cSo what? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s a Ranker. He\u2019s only a guy that just got to the 20th Floor.\u201d\u201cHe was still very impressive in the latest Grand Martial Arts Tournament.\u201dThe Giants whispered amongst themselves as they followed Kwant and approached Yuwon.Stomp, stomp\u2014They might have been young, but they were still Giants. And five of them at that.It was an intimidating sight, seeing them all approach someone at once.Kwant led the pack.\u201cSo we meet again,\u201d he said with a sinister smile. \u201cAnd would you look at that? That son of a bitch Buar isn\u2019t here,\u201dWith an intimidating face and stature, Kwant was seriously picking a fight against YuWon.It might have been because he had met Urpha yesterday, but Kwant now looked cute to YuWon by comparison.Kwant\u2019s gang tried to stop him.\u201cHey. I think you\u2019re going too far with the Elder\u2019s guest\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he had a reason for calling him here\u2026\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d Kwant growled. \u201cAll humans are enemies. Every single one of them.\u201dYuWon let out a laugh. It was like seeing kids that wouldn\u2019t listen to their teacher. Though Urpha was more like a principle in this metaphor.\u201cHe\u2019s laughing?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up with him?\u201d\u201cIs he trying to hurt our pride?\u201dYuWon realized that they really were just big kids, seeing how easily they were provoked by some simple laughter.\u201cI don\u2019t think you understand the situation you\u2019re in right now\u2026\u201d Kwant threatened YuWon while reaching his hand out to him.The size of Kwant\u2019s palm was bigger than YuWon\u2019s head.YuWon also reached his hand out to Kwant.Clench\u2014The two grabbed each others\u2019 hands.Squeeze\u2014\u2018No way. Is this guy\u2026\u2019 Kwant couldn\u2019t believe that YuWon had grabbed his hand. \u2018\u2026 Trying to challenge a Giant in strength when he\u2019s only a human?\u2019Kwant had heard plenty about YuWon\u2019s skills. He was also well aware that he had been going around topping all the test rankings and that he was the winner of the Grand Martial Arts Tournament, which proved that he was the strongest among the players in the lower floors.But setting all that aside, Giants were the greatest when it came to physical strength. That was the power of genetics.\u2018I\u2019m going to crush you,\u2019 Kwant thought as he squeezed YuWon\u2019s hand.But\u2026\u201cKgh\u2026\u201dThe one that ended up feeling pain was Kwant.Crack, crack\u2014\u201cKugh!\u201dHis fingers started to twist, and bones started to break.\u2018What\u2019s going on\u2026?\u2019 He wondered.Kwant tried to strengthen his grip through the pain, but nothing changed.Crack, crack\u2014\u201cKuaaaagh!!\u201dThud\u2014With his hand crushed and broken, Kwant fell to his knees in pain. He tried to pull back his hand, but it wouldn\u2019t budge.\u201cM-My hand! My hand!\u201dKwant tried to smack YuWon with his other hand while screaming in pain. It was unsightly compared to how prideful he was acting just a moment ago.\u201cW-What the\u2026?\u201d\u201cDid Kwant just lose in strength?\u201d\u201cAgainst a human?\u201dIn terms of strength, there was no race that could beat the Giants in the Tower.Of course, there were plenty of humans that were as strong as Giants with enough stats and levels, but most of them were Rankers.Kwant was a player that had reached a much higher floor than YuWon.\u201cThere\u2019s more than just five of you guys, right?\u201d YuWon asked.Adam was one of the central residences of the Giants. There were likely tens of thousands of Giants living inside this tree.With more than enough time left until the start of the test, YuWon smirked, having come up with a good idea.\u201cGo call all your friends,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll play as much as you guys want.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you trying to fight him?\u201d Nwiar asked.\u201cNo, I was, uh, going to stop them. He might be able to handle one or two, but look how many people are flocking to him. It\u2019s dangerous.\u201dBuar pulled the excuse out of his ass, but he wasn\u2019t wrong. Nwiar was able to count at least ten Giants running towards the commotion.\u201c\u2026 You\u2019re not wrong,\u201d Nwiar said in defeat.\u201cSee? Now let\u2019s go. Hurry up.\u201dBuar pressured Nwiar to move faster, running through the trunk of the tree and up twenty branches.Bam\u2014!He heard a loud noise in the distance.As someone who had spent his entire life fighting daily, Buar recognized this sound. It was the sound of fists colliding with each other.\u201cWow\u2014!\u201d Buar gasped while finding the group of Giants gathered on one of the branches of Adam.They were all young Giants like him.\u201cWhat a nice sight. Now this is youth,\u201d he remarked.They were gathered in a circle, creating a stage of sorts.Buar broke through the group and made his way through.Once the other young Giants noticed Buar, they moved aside for him.As he made his way in\u2026\u201cKgh\u2026 Ugh\u2026\u201dBuar found a Giant laying on the floor cradling his fist and YuWon standing in front of the Giant moaning in pain.\u201cSo that\u2019s it for Tulkar.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go next!\u201dAs one Giant fell, another opponent stepped up to the plate.Stomp, stomp\u2014It was one of the bigger Giants that were gathered there.His name was Vulkan, and he was about ten years older than Buar.\u201cOh. Finally\u2026\u201d\u201cThis fight should be more fun to watch.\u201d\u201cBut is he actually a human?\u201dThere were about a hundred Giants gathered around YuWon.They were all young Giants like Buar, and they were multiple times bigger than YuWon.But the main character that had set this stage was YuWon. More than a dozen Giants had already lost to him.YuWon let out a sigh while looking at the Giant named Vulkan who had stepped forward. \u201cCould you guys just gang up on me instead of coming one at a time?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Vulkan, who held a giant hammer, said with a red face, \u201cAre you underestimating me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not that, but\u2026\u201d YuWon said while scratching his head. \u201cActually, you\u2019re right.\u201dYuWon grabbed Vulkan\u2019s shoulder.\u201cHuh?\u201dVulkan was confused. He wondered what YuWon, a guy much skinnier and shorter than him, was trying to do by reaching his hand up and grabbing his shoulder\u2026Whoosh\u2014Thud\u2014But in an instant, Vulkan was brought to his knees.His eyes widened in shock from having suddenly lost his balance.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201dAnd it didn\u2019t end at him being brought to his knees.Push\u2014Wobble\u2014As YuWon pressed down on his shoulder, Vulkan\u2019s upper body was smashed to the ground.He couldn\u2019t move an inch. There was far too great of a difference in strength.[Your arm has been imbued with the power of a Giant.][Partial Gigantification will occur.]Power was overflowing in YuWon\u2019s arm.Vulkan tried his best to push away YuWon\u2019s hand, but he failed.After bringing Vulkan down in a flash with pure strength, YuWon looked around.A hundred Giants had gathered before he realized it.\u201cStill no change of heart?\u201d YuWon asked.He was taunting them, telling them to stop trickling in because he was more than strong enough.\u201c\u2026 I knew it,\u201d Buar said.He felt electrified. YuWon was strong, as he expected. In fact, he seemed stronger than his original estimation.Buar\u2019s blood boiled intensly.As he was about to step up, Nwiar joined him.\u201cYou want to go as well?\u201d he asked his little sister.\u201cThis is what he wants. Might as well consider it as a bit of unique guest treatment.\u201dYuWon watched the siblings, having spotted them.Buar and Nwiar locked eyes.\u201cHe did indeed.\u201dBuar and Nwiar stepped into the circle.The Giants started to whisper.\u201cIt\u2019s Buar and his little sister.\u201d\u201cHot damn\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to get to watch the descendents of the Giant Gods fight?\u201dThe Giant Gods. They were the leaders of the Giants, and each of them possessed the strength of a High Ranker.Only a few of them were still alive, and it appeared that Buar and Nwiar were descendants of one of those gods.\u2018So they\u2019re more important than I originally thought,\u2019 YuWon thought.That explained why he thought most of the other Giants here seemed weaker in comparison to the sibling duo.Kwant\u2019s hand strength, for example, was not even close to Buar\u2019s.\u2018But I\u2019ve never heard of either of them.\u2019Buar and Nwiar were names he was not familiar with.There was also that red-haired player, Horang. There were quite a few skilled people he had never heard of on this floor.YuWon grinned a little. It seemed that they might be a bit helpful, unlike the others.\u201cMy body\u2019s been itching since yesterday,\u201d Buar said while his body expanded. \u201cNow let\u2019s see how amazing your skills really are.\u201d\u201cYou can see as much as you want,\u201d YuWon bantered.Fwoosh\u2014Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksYuWon\u2019s eyes became flaming red.[Cinder Eyes reads the path.]\u201cIf you can last that is,\u201d he taunted.* * *Through the use of [Cinder Eyes,] he could clearly see the muscle movements of Buar and Nwiar. He could see how their bodies were moving and where they were headed.YuWon\u2019s mind started to work faster using said visual information, and his senses started to twitch.[Activating Sensory Field.]Fwoosh\u2014!YuWon\u2019s ability to perceive everything expanded, and the space around him felt like it was all in the palm of his hand.Thinking that YuWon had finished preparing, Buar made the first move.Boom\u2014!Shortening the long distance between them, Buar\u2019s fist created a sonic boom as it just grazed over the top of YuWon\u2019s head.YuWon tried to get up close to Buar, but his move was greeted by Buar\u2019s knee flying at his chin.The knee strike was stopped by YuWon\u2019s non-dominant hand.Bang\u2014!Wince\u2014YuWon felt numbing pain in the hand he blocked the attack with.He decided to give up on getting up close and personal as he noticed Nwiar\u2019s punch coming from behind him.\u2018I\u2019ll strike back,\u2019 YuWon decided.Klang\u2014!Nwiar\u2019s fist and YuWon\u2019s sword clashed.Nwiar\u2019s fist was unscathed. In fact, YuWon\u2019s sword was the one that got pushed back.\u2018Her strength\u2019s no joke,\u2019 YuWon thought, his eyes wavering.They were much stronger than expected, meaning that it wasn\u2019t going to be possible for YuWon to take the sibling duo with no mana and only physical strength.YuWon heard Buar\u2019s voice behind him.\u201cDo you know why I can\u2019t talk back to my little sister?\u201dClench\u2014Buar tightened his fist, getting into position to swing as hard as he could.\u201cIt\u2019s because she\u2019s stronger than me,\u201d Buar explained.Whoosh\u2014!YuWon was cornered front and back with nowhere to escape.Buar became sure of their victory, thinking, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019Klang\u2014!He felt a satisfying thud under his punch, but he quickly came to a realization.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201dBuar and Nwiar locked eyes with each other in confusion.YuWon had disappeared.Bump\u2014A noise came from above them.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up there?\u201dYuWon had jumped up into the sky by leaping off air.This wasn\u2019t just him jumping high.Bump\u2014His feet were pushing off of thin air. It was like there was something invisible under his feet.[Hermes\u2019s Treads]\u15cc Shoes that Hermes lost long ago. They are imbued with his powers.\u15cc +50% jumping ability.\u15cc Able to double-jump midair.\u15cc Able to use Skill \u2013 Sky Step once a day.This was the item YuWon bought using the CP he had earned on the 11th Floor.If he couldn\u2019t go forwards or backwards, then going up was the natural answer.\u2018He jumped higher than our height at such a fast speed?\u2019 Nwiar was taken aback.Swish\u2014!YuWon swung his sword down, adding to it the power of gravity.Slit\u2014A long cut was inflicted on Nwiar\u2019s arm.Buar became enraged at the sight of blood spurting out of his sister\u2019s arm.\u201cHow dare you!\u201d He shouted.Whoosh\u2014Buar\u2019s punch once again split the air.His punch missed again, but Buar wasn\u2019t alone.\u201cNow! Corner him!\u201d Buar instructed.\u201cGot it!\u201dFwoosh\u2014!Disregarding the wound on her arm, Nwiar moved in harmony with her brother.Fwoop, crash\u2014!Whoosh\u2014Buar glared at YuWon, who was dodging all his punches like a slippery eel. Even with the duo fighting together, they couldn\u2019t land a single hit.\u2018This is tricky,\u2019 Buar thought.YuWon wasn\u2019t just fast. Not only could he duck or slide to either side, but he could jump up to dodge their attacks.Buar didn\u2019t know what kind of skill it was, but it was clear that YuWon could jump again in midair.At first it might not have seemed that impressive of a skill, but facing it was incredibly tricky.Normally, one would have no additional escape route if they jumped up, but this guy could double-jump and change directions. \u2018He essentially has another layer of movement,\u2019 Buar analyzed.With additional possible directions for evasion, attacking YuWon was a dizzying task.And more than that\u2026\u2018I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever be able to catch him,\u2019 Buar thought.Despite the two trying to corner him, YuWon wasn\u2019t even attacking them back. He simply dodged all attacks.At first they thought it might have been because he had no room to attack, but that wasn\u2019t the case.\u2018I\u2019m only punching dead air.\u2019 Buar felt defeated.No matter how much he swung his fists, he swung at nothing, and he didn\u2019t think his punches would reach YuWon anytime soon.YuWon watched Buar and Nwiar with eyes that made him seem like he knew everything.Buar grit his teeth, \u201cYou think I can\u2019t catch you?!\u201dVwoom, vwooooom\u2014Mana gathered around Buar\u2019s fist. The condensed mana vibrated as if it was ready to explode any second.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Nwiar shouted in surprise, seeing her brother enraged.Buar\u2019s flow of mana wasn\u2019t normal.Vzzt\u2014It was to the point that Buar\u2019s body started showing signs of penalty, demonstrating how much power Buar was exerting.Unfortunately, it was too late to stop him.\u201cEat this!\u201d Buar shouted while swinging his fist.Read latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt didn\u2019t matter to him if YuWon could or couldn\u2019t dodge this because this attack was about to wipe out everything in front of him.YuWon watched the fist flying at him.The punch moved ever so slowly, and he could clearly see the flow of mana contained within.\u2018This attack\u2026\u2019 YuWon decided that instead of dodging, he had to strike it away.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because the moment he broke that rule, this would devolve from training into just a children\u2019s fight.Fwoosh\u2014!With Buar\u2019s fist, the mana ripple became a huge wave, ready to crash into him.YuWon had to read a path to break through it before getting caught up in it.[Cinder Eyes reads the path.]With the expanded senses, time felt like it was flowing slower.It came with an additional overload on the brain, but YuWon had that much more time to make decisions, and everything he saw felt clearer.The flow of mana could be felt clearly on the skin, and he could precisely see the point where he could break through in the mana wave that was heading towards him.\u2018There,\u2019 YuWon thought while raising his sword.The point was miniscule, and it moved with the flow of the wave. But he still had to do it in order to pierce through.And so YuWon didn\u2019t dodge the wave, but instead thrusted with all he had.* * *Whoosh\u2014Buar saw the tip of the sword coming at him.At that moment, he wondered, \u2018He\u2019s going to counterattack?\u2019He sensed nothing from YuWon. YuWon wasn\u2019t using even the slightest bit of mana. He was using purely physical strength to counter his punch.\u2018He\u2019s even more reckless than a Giant.\u2019That was the only thought in Buar\u2019s mind. It was already proven that he was ahead of YuWon in terms of strength. Buar was overexerting power in order to try to stop YuWon from dodging around. And now, instead of evading, YuWon was coming in for a direct confrontation.It was obvious who would be the winner before they even clashed.\u201cBig brother!\u201d Nwiar shouted in surprise.This was a situation where YuWon could get seriously hurt, and if that were to happen, they\u2019d feel ashamed in front of Urpha.\u2018Sorry, but\u2026\u2019 Buar thought while swinging his fist, \u2018It\u2019s too late.\u2019In that moment\u2026Slice\u2014Through the mana wave, a thin line pierced through.Fwooo\u2014The massive collection of mana that looked like it was going to wipe out the entire vicinity split apart. And the thin line that pierced the wave quickly approached Buar.\u201cWhat the\u2026?\u201d Buar was shocked by what had just happened.He wondered how in the world YuWon managed to break through the humongous flow of mana.Fss\u2014The \u2018line\u2019 that Buar saw was YuWon\u2019s sword.YuWon dodged Buar\u2019s fist and broke through the huge mana wave, and now the tip of his sword was pointed close to Buar\u2019s neck.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWow\u2026\u201dThe surrounding Giants reacted with silence or muted awe.That included Nwiar, who was worried that YuWon was going to get injured. In fact, she was the one who was the most shocked because she had been engaged in combat with him.\u2018What just happened\u2026?\u2019 She wondered.Buar had made an attack while taking on the penalty, and YuWon had thrust his sword in response.It was certainly a much weaker attack, akin to throwing an egg against a boulder. But in the end, the egg had smashed the boulder into pieces.Shing\u2014With Buar remaining still, YuWon pulled back the sword that was against his throat.The fight was now over.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dYuWon\u2019s eyes returned to their original color.He felt a headache, and his vision was a bit shaky, but the results weren\u2019t half bad.\u201cIt worked,\u201d YuWon said to himself.He won against Buar, a Giant, without using any mana. It was a victory against a player of a significantly higher floor.He did acknowledge that a bit of luck played a part in his win, but defeating Buar without using mana or other skills was monumental.\u201cI-I lost,\u201d Buar declared his defeat, albeit a little late.Since he had been unable to respond to a sword at his neck, it was his complete defeat.\u201cYou guys were at least better than the rest,\u201d YuWon said.Thanks to the siblings, he was able to use [Cinder Eyes] and [Sensory Field] until he felt a bit worn out. And he had gotten a bit used to using \u300cHermes\u2019s Treads,\u300d but this was the first time he had used them this much in one day.The Giant siblings were the perfect opponents for YuWon to hone his dulled senses against.\u201cI hope we can do more of this,\u201d YuWon said, extending his hand.There was a limit to training alone, so having someone to help him train was good news. If possible, he wanted to continue getting Buar and Nwiar\u2019s help.Buar looked intensely at YuWon\u2019s hand before reaching for it.\u201cIt\u2019ll be my pleasure.\u201dSqueeze\u2014YuWon could sense Buar\u2019s fighting spirit from his strong handshake.\u201cI look forward to it.\u201d* * *Ten days had gone by.Fighting, more fighting, and today as well, he was fighting.Fwoop\u2014Swoosh, fwoosh\u2014\u201cNwiar!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dNwiar leaped into the air and crashed down.Thump\u2014!Her size and weight shook the branch of Adam upon impact. The force was much greater than what should have been possible for Nwiar\u2019s size.\u201cIs it a Weight Amplification Technique?\u201d YuWon wondered.Every player in the Tower learned martial arts on the 10th Floor, and the technique Nwiar just displayed looked like a practical application of martial arts from the Martial Realm.\u201cSo you guys haven\u2019t shown me all your cards yet,\u201d YuWon said.YuWon\u2019s sword grazed past Nwiar\u2019s torso.\u201cI got you!\u201d Kwant shouted while swinging his mace down.Whoosh\u2014Slam\u2014!The mace missed, but it was obvious in which direction YuWon would dodge.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cVulcan! Dariwul!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201dVulkan and Dariwul, who had been anticipating YuWon\u2019s evasion, moved together.Their timing was perfectly matched to YuWon\u2019s moves. Vulkan headed in the direction that YuWon jumped in, and Dariwul waited while watching where YuWon would double jump towards.And of course, Buar didn\u2019t stay still while this was happening. He leaped in the direction that YuWon had jumped towards.Even though YuWon was capable of jumping again while in the air, there were far too many Giants heading for him.\u201cGot ya!\u201d Vulkan shouted while reaching his hands out for YuWon.Vulkan, who was the biggest among the five, tried to grab YuWon around the waist.However\u2026Fss, fss\u2014YuWon disappeared from his spot.\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2014?\u201d\u201cWhere did he go?\u201dThe five began to look around to find the now missing YuWon.That was when Vulkan, who was still midair after jumping after YuWon, was caught by the ankle.Grasp\u2014Fwoosh\u2014Vulkan\u2019s body was swung higher up into the air.In an instant, YuWon had jumped below Vulkan and had flung him by the ankle.Vulkan\u2019s massive body became a deadly blunt weapon.Wham, blam\u2014!\u201cKgh!\u201d\u201cKugh!\u201dVulkan was forced to collide with Buar and Dariwul.Nwiar just barely managed to dodge this attack.Tak\u2014YuWon finally landed back down on the ground.Nwiar and Kwant, who had been waiting for him from below, made their move.Mana started wrapping around Nwiar\u2019s fist.The fist, imbued with a ridiculous amount of power, flew at YuWon, causing the air to shake.Rumble, rumble\u2014It was the same technique that Buar had used before. The mana that formed the wave was densely packed together. There was no point of evasion nor a nullification point visible to YuWon.Behind him, Kwant was coming at him swinging his mace.YuWon turned around and headed for Kwant.Ssk\u2014With the tip of his sword, YuWon slightly changed the trajectory of Kwant\u2019s mace.Crash\u2014!YuWon\u2019s sword and Kwant\u2019s mace blocked Nwiar\u2019s punch together.\u2018He used my strength to his advantage\u2026?\u2019 Kwant was shocked.He found himself standing beside YuWon, but he was too late to notice.Crack\u2014\u201cAhhhhhh!\u201dYuWon struck Kwant\u2019s wrist with his elbow, making him crumple in pain.He then started charging Nwiar.Fwoosh, fwoosh\u2014Nwiar was the most skilled among the five.She swung her fists at YuWon, who was coming at her head on.YuWon dodged a myriad of punches in a matter of seconds, but in the end, he got grabbed by the collar of this shirt.\u201cHiyah!\u201d Nwiar shouted, trying to lift YuWon up to slam him into the ground.However, strangely enough, she could not lift him.He was heavy.YuWon, who looked like a child next to her, should have been as light as a feather, but she couldn\u2019t even budge him.\u201cI decided to use it too,\u201d YuWon said, bringing the edge of his blade to Nwiar\u2019s neck. \u201cThe Weight Amplification Technique.\u201dThe [Weight Amplification Technique] was not a special skill. It was a simple technique of the Martial Realm where you increased your weight by shifting your power in a single direction.\u201c\u2026\u201dFeeling dejected, Nwiar eased up and lowered her fist.The fight was over.The others also felt dejected. They were either sighing in frustration or moaning in pain, like Kwant.Nwiar said with disbelief, \u201cYou can now defeat five of us like it\u2019s nothing.\u201dShe didn\u2019t think they were going to win, but she also didn\u2019t think the fight would end up being settled so soon.However, the reality was that in a matter of minutes they had all been thrown to the ground, and she even ended up with a sword to her neck.\u201cYou\u2019re completely different from just ten days ago.\u201dIt was the damnedest thing. At first, it felt like the two of them could almost take him on. Like there was just a slight difference between the sibling duo and YuWon and that she could reach him. But as time went on, the gap only widened.And then, YuWon made a proposal.\u201cLet\u2019s add one more person to the mix.\u201dThe first volunteer was Kwant.Knowing that he himself wasn\u2019t good enough, he decided to fight YuWon by helping the siblings.But the results were the same.The only difference was how long the fight took. In the end, YuWon was always the victor.And, of course, this time was no different.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t particularly feel like he\u2019s gotten stronger\u2026\u201d one of them commented.YuWon was always like this.It felt like he was just barely too short of their grasp, that they could also almost get him.At first, they thought two would suffice against him, but the results of the fight demonstrated otherwise. And it was the same with three and four.\u201cAre you getting adapted to something?\u201d Nwiar asked.\u201cYeah. There\u2019s a skill I have to get used to using,\u201d YuWon didn\u2019t deny it.His answer only made Nwiar feel more dejected. She knew for a fact that YuWon was barely using any mana. She knew he should have other skills, but Yuwon was purposely not using them.Nwiar wanted to make him use his skills by any means necessary, but she wasn\u2019t able to make that happen.\u2018How much stronger would he be if he fought seriously?\u2019 Nwiar thought.It was something she had wondered multiple times now, and she wanted desperately to force him to do it, no matter what.\u201cLet\u2019s rest a little bit before we continue. Actually, should we add another person to our side? Make it six,\u201d Nwiar asked, thinking once again that they were only falling slightly short of him.But the answer she got was unexpected.\u201cNo,\u201d Yuwon turned around, having sweated enough. \u201cLet\u2019s stop here.\u201d\u201cWhat? Why?\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s almost time for the test.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIt was an acceptable answer for Nwiar. YuWon was a player who had only recently arrived on the 20th Floor. It was just that his skills made her forget that fact.\u201cGet some good rest, guys,\u201d YuWon said while looking at Kwant, who got majorly injured. \u201cA big fight\u2019s coming.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The test,\u201d Buar asked in disappointment.Not only was he disappointed that he couldn\u2019t beat Yuwon once, it seemed that he had grown close to YuWon.\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cAre you going to come back after the test?\u201dYuWon thought for a moment before nodding. \u201cI will if I remember.\u201dYuWon wasn\u2019t the type to make empty promises. He was being serious about possibly visiting if he ever came back to the 20th Floor.\u201cSo you\u2019re not totally heartless, even if you do talk like a jackass.\u201d\u201cEat your food.\u201dBonk\u2014Nwiar hit Buar in the head with a slab of meat.Buar was an obedient big brother, so he did as she said.Nwiar let out a sigh while looking over to YuWon.\u201cI\u2019m sorry that my big brother is still so childish\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay.

For example, Vulkan was tearing apart meat off the bone from a chunk that was bigger than YuWon\u2019s entire body.Around the time the meal was ending, Buar asked a question as it popped into his head, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you were searching for the Stone of the Sea?\u201dIt was something he had forgotten about because he had been so focused on fighting YuWon.The \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300d It was an item that was passed down as part of a legend in the world of the 20th Floor.YuWon had approached the Giants in search of an item that people weren\u2019t even certain actually existed or not.\u201cYeah,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cWhat happened to that? Are you going to come back down after passing the test and moving onto the next floor?\u201dYuWon shook his head.Buar squinted because it didn\u2019t add up. He asked, \u201cThen what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to find the Stone of the Sea before I go to the next floor.\u201dOne would have to be really stupid to not understand the meaning behind what YuWon just said.\u201cIs it at the test site?\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t answer since they would know the truth soon enough.\u201cDoes the Elder know?\u201d\u201cMore or less.\u201d\u201cHahh\u2026\u201d Buar exhaled. \u201cSo that thing really was connected to us\u2026\u201dThe Giants possessing the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d was a rumor that had been floating around for a long time, and due to that rumor, Giants had suffered at the hands of countless players and Rankers. They would demand the stone, asking where it was, to tell them everything they knew.\u201cIf your father is one of the Giant Gods, then it\u2019s highly likely he knew. He just didn\u2019t tell you guys,\u201d YuWon said.\u201cIs that item really that important?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s very important.\u201d\u201cThen why can\u2019t we just take possession of it? Why\u2014\u201d Buar\u2019s question got cut short.\u201cAre you dumb?\u201d Nwiar asked while letting out a sigh of disappointment. \u201cWhy do you think he\u2019s taking the test tomorrow? It obviously means the Stone and taking the test are connected.\u201d\u201cIs that what that means?\u201d Buar asked.YuWon nodded his head.The \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300d Its other name was the \u300cDivine Sea Crystal,\u300d and it was also known as the \u300cTrident\u2019s Fragment.\u300dAnd that item was connected to the test of the 20th Floor.\u201cSo why did the Elder ask for you?\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m the strongest.\u201dYuWon\u2019s blunt answer made Buar, Kwant, and Vulkan make a sour face. But none of them could say anything in response.If you only looked at the 20th Floor, then YuWon was without a doubt the strongest player. On top of that\u2026\u2018There\u2019s a chance he might be close to having the power of a Ranker\u2026\u2019 Buar thought while looking at YuWon.The legend of the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d has been tormenting the Giants for a thousand years now, since the end of the Gigantomachy.And now, the guy standing in front of Buar might be the person to bring an end to that legend.\u201cHow could the Elder do this?\u201d Kwant said while throwing the meat he was eating back onto his plate. \u201cHe knew the truth, yet he purposely stayed silent all along? He knows how much we\u2019ve been tormented because of this stupid legend.\u201d\u201cKwant.\u201d\u201cAm I wrong? Do you know how many times people have picked a fight with me because of it? I almost died a few of those times, damn it.\u201d Kwant progressively raised his voice, \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t we have just given them that stupid stone?! Is that treasure more valuable than the safety of our children?! Huh?!\u201dGiants ended up in altercations large and small as they climbed the Tower. While some were intimidated by their size and stayed away, others intentionally picked fights with them, knowing the Giants\u2019 situation.And more than half of those fights were with people who were after the \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300dBuar and Nwiar couldn\u2019t say anything to rebut Kwant. Normally, they would be stoutly defending Urpha, but this was a situation where they had nothing they could say because Kwant was right. Even their meeting with YuWon was because of a gang of players picking a fight with them.\u201cWhat could a stupid stone be worth that the Elder\u2014\u201dHe had finished his meal and was getting up. Kwant\u2019s sitting height was taller than YuWon\u2019s standing height.He stared at YuWon with eyes bloodshot from rage.\u201cHe made the smart decision?\u201d Kwant asked.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not even a part of our race. Don\u2019t talk like you know everything\u2026\u201d\u201cIf that stone fell into the wrong hands, you guys would all be dead by now,\u201d YuWon said while turning around. \u201cAnything\u2019s better than complete genocide.\u201d\u201cI said, don\u2019t talk like you know everything!\u201d Kwant shouted, jumping into the air and swinging his fist.Unfortunately, his opponent was someone that they couldn\u2019t beat even while ganging up five on one.Grab\u2014Yank, slam\u2014!\u201cKugh!\u201dYuWon grabbed Kwant by the collar and drove him into the ground.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksHe then asked Kwant, who was lying limp on the floor, \u201cWhat about you? What do you know about Elder Urpha?\u201dYuWon looked at Kwant and the other young Giants with disappointment before turning around and saying, \u201cBeing ignorant isn\u2019t a crime, but if you don\u2019t know anything, you should at least keep your mouth shut.\u201dStep, step\u2014YuWon then walked away from the commotion.Buar watched YuWon walk away for a moment before turning his focus to Kwant, who was lying on the ground.\u201cYou okay?\u201d Buar asked.\u201cJeez\u2026 What\u2019s up with that stupid amount of strength\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just strength. If we only looked at strength, I\u2019m stronger than him.\u201d\u201cWhatever. Help me up already. I feel like I pulled my back or something. I can\u2019t get up.\u201d\u201cYou idiot,\u201d Buar remarked while he helped Kwant get up.Kwant groaned as he got up with Buar\u2019s help. He then looked in the direction YuWon disappeared, saying, \u201cThat guy knows something, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get up to your weird ideas again. No matter what you try, it\u2019s not going to work.\u201d Buar warned him.\u201cDo I look like a kid?\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019re even worse than a kid.\u201d\u201cNgh\u2026\u201d Kwant couldn\u2019t say anything.\u201cBut I do agree that he knows something. I can tell by how he sought out Elder Urpha and what he just said.\u201dBuar was talking about how if the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d fell into the wrong hands, the Giants would be annihilated.What YuWon told them stuck in their minds, and Elder Urpha would have been the type of person who probably would have kept the Stone a secret, knowing such a thing.* * *YuWon returned back to his room.The only things inside the room were a 10-meter-long bed, a pole to use as a clothes rack, and a nightstand.This was the place that YuWon had been staying in for the last ten days.Flop\u2014YuWon jumped up onto the bed and laid down.The bed was so big, it was taller than YuWon\u2019s height.Wince\u2014His head still hurt.It was the side effect of using [Cinder Eyes] and [Sensory Field] nonstop for the last ten days.\u2018I should restrain myself until the start of the test.\u2019Maintaining your condition before a test was a must, so he decided to ban himself from using [Cinder Eyes] and [Sensory Field] together until the start of the test.Vwoom\u2014His right hand, which was equipped with \u300cKyne\u0113,\u300d vibrated.YuWon stretched out his hand towards the ceiling.Kyne\u0113 was letting out a sound.Vzzt, vzzt\u2014It then started to release mana on its own.This was a phenomenon that happened when YuWon let down his guard even the slightest bit.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s going crazy again.\u201dYuWon made mana flow into his right hand to forcefully suppress the mana coming out of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dSpark, crackle\u2014There wasn\u2019t much of a resistance.Fortunately, \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d could be suppressed quickly. But it still felt like holding onto a bomb that could explode at any moment.\u2018Is it because of the Trident\u2019s Fragment?\u2019The Trident was a weapon that symbolized Posiedon, the God of the Sea.The \u300cTrident\u2019s Fragment\u300d was an item similar to Kyne\u0113\u2019s crafting material, the \u300cDivine Dark Crystal.\u300d And it was potentially a different part of the \u2018eye\u2019 that YuWon saw not too long ago.\u2018Kyne\u0113\u2019s been responding to it since I got to the 20th Floor.\u2019At first, it only reacted once every few days, but that time frame had begun to progressively get shorter and shorter.\u201c\u2026 Are they really reacting to each other?\u201dThere was no way to be certain, but he started to think it was very plausible.When he first thought they might be reacting to each other, YuWon had a silly thought: \u2018Can I maybe use Kyne\u0113 like a Dragon Ball radar?\u2019It was a silly thought, but it wasn\u2019t impossible either. If the three fragments were originally one, then it wouldn\u2019t be so strange if the fragments responded to each other.Because of this hypothesis, YuWon started practicing handling \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d after coming back to his room.The room was so large, it was more than sufficient to use as a training space.YuWon extended his arm and clenched his hand.Thinking back on it, YuWon didn\u2019t have a chance to properly use \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d after it was completed. But that was because he didn\u2019t have a worthy opponent for it yet.He did try and practice using it little by little, but he had yet to use it to its maximum effect yet.\u2018If this is the key to this floor\u2019s test\u2026\u2019For YuWon, the test on the 20th Floor was a test to obtain the \u300cTrident\u2019s Fragment.\u300d So if \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d could be a clue for it, he needed a way to know for certain.YuWon closed his eyes and focused on \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300d\u2018Open your eyes.\u2019Fss, fssss\u2014A black-tinted mana started to flow out of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dThis time, it wasn\u2019t \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d acting independently. It was acting in response to YuWon\u2019s will.\u2018Open\u2026 your eyes.\u2019YuWon thought back to the black wall that surrounded him and the mysterious yellow eye.That thing was \u300cKyne\u0113\u300d itself and a part of something. A being that wanted to recover a part of itself, the \u300cTrident\u2019s Fragment.\u300dYuWon continued to search for it, but the problem was that it was now the day before the test, and there was still no response.YuWon\u2019s patience started to wear thin.Fwoosh\u2014YuWon showered [Holy Fire] down on \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300d\u201cStop sleeping\u2026\u201dRead latest chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat was when\u2026Fssss\u2014\u2026 A black wall started to surround YuWon, just like when he first got ahold of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dYuWon continued, speaking to the yellow eye that appeared in front of him, \u201c\u2026 And wake up.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Don\u2019t be spotted by other players. Be careful of the penalty.\u2019\u201dThey were all troublesome conditions.\u201cOlympus has gotten quite timid. They must have quite a number of skeletons in the closet,\u201d Theseus commented.\u201cThere were incidents on the 1st and 11th Floors, so it can\u2019t be helped, sir.\u201dTheseus looked over at Sipholiose, a fellow Olympian Ranker who had brought him the order.Theseus was aware of the situation. \u201cA lot sure has happened. After failing to capture Hephaestus on the 1st Floor, Hypnos got caught interfering with a test on the 11th Floor by the Administrator.\u201dThanks to all that, Olympus was currently under special watch by the Administrators.\u201cFor me to be tasked with cleaning up after the mess created by those idiots\u2026\u201d\u201cLady Hera believes you\u2019ll do an excellent job.\u201dTheseus let out a deep sigh.It wasn\u2019t that difficult of a task, but the problem was that it was something that violated the rules of the Tower, and if the Administrator were to find out, this could be the final nail in the coffin.Something that shouldn\u2019t be done had already happened twice.\u201cIt isn\u2019t all that difficult of a task, but\u2026\u201d Theseus stopped and shook his head after a thought came to him. \u201cNo, if it wasn\u2019t difficult, people wouldn\u2019t have failed twice now.\u201dThis was a guy who had started fighting a Ranker on the 1st Floor. He then won against a Ranker test examiner on the 11th Floor, and it was unknown how much stronger he might have become by now.Theseus decided that he would no longer view Kim YuWon as a \u2018player.\u2019\u201cSo, who are the players that will be helping me? I don\u2019t think we should be using Rankers for this.\u201d\u201cThe Crimson Wolf Guild offered to cooperate with us.\u201d\u201cCrimson Wolf?\u201d Theseus nodded his head while trying to remember who they were. \u201cOh, those psychos.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re infamous for being bad guys in the lower floors, even though they\u2019re just a small guild with only two Rankers.\u201d\u201cI heard that Horang is quite the guy.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s currently on this floor, sir.\u201d\u201cOh really?\u201d\u201cHe was the first one to bring us news that YuWon is on this floor. I believe he\u2019ll be a great help.\u201dThis was good news.The Crimson Wolf Guild was a relatively useful guild, and Horang was a player who had started to prove his worth lately, enough that even Olympus offered to recruit him.\u201cLet\u2019s leave that to the Crimson Wolf Guild then. Tell them to make a move before or after the test. As for the test itself\u2026\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be planting players from our side, but I think it\u2019ll be best if you don\u2019t have any expectations, sir.\u201d\u201cGo figure.\u201d\u201cWill you personally make a move, sir?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a chance that the Crimson Wolf Guild might fail, so I\u2019m thinking of bringing along a few guys from the Bureau.\u201dAnyone with the Bureau was going to be at least a Ranker. Theseus alone was worth at least three or four average Rankers, but now there were going to be a few more Rankers added to the mix.\u2018For certain this time.\u2019Sipholiose bowed down, \u201cI shall leave this in your care, sir.\u201d\u201cScram already.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dSipholiose disappeared like melting snow. But Theseus was not surprised as he knew it was just an illusion all along.Flop\u2014Theseus dug himself deep into his sofa.He was given such a headache-inducing problem to take care of.\u201cKim YuWon\u2026\u201dHe had heard a lot about him. From how he was the strongest player ever to how he has been nothing but a sore spot for Olympus recently.There was no mistake that he would become even more of a headache in the future. He was a pest they had to crush before he got a chance to grow bigger.But at least for now, or even quite a bit into the future, there was no way he could actually rival Olympus, so Theseus didn\u2019t really care about YuWon that much.There was only one thing he really cared about.\u201cSo he disappeared with the Giants, huh.\u201dThe thing that his father, Poseidon, was desperately searching for. The \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300d* * *The test of the 20th Floor was held on a tiny island.The island named Triton was about 10km wide, and it was covered in seagrass.Atop the island, various sea monsters resided.\u201cThis place always gives me the heebie-jeebies,\u201d Buar commented.\u201cYeah, you almost died to a chimera back then,\u201d Nwiar responded.\u201cI never saw something that creepy before.\u201d\u201cThis place is really similar to the Tutorial island. I wonder if maybe they modeled it after this place?\u201dBuar and Nwiar chatted as they arrived on Triton.As ordered by Urpha, the two acted as a guide for YuWon. Their job was to show YuWon to the test site and shield YuWon from anyone who might try and pick a fight with him.\u201cThe Elder\u2019s worried about nothing. Like, what could possibly be a threat to this guy?\u201d Buar said in disbelief.The 20th Floor\u2019s test was much harder in comparison to previous floors, but it was a test that Buar and Nwiar had managed to pass. He saw no reason why YuWon wouldn\u2019t pass it.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s not a normal test,\u201d Nwiar hypothesized.\u201cMaybe.\u201d\u201cRankers from our side are keeping an eye on this test, but only a few have managed to come so that it doesn\u2019t break out into a war.\u201d\u201cSo it really is a big deal,\u201d Buar said while turning his head back to YuWon.YuWon hadn\u2019t said a word since they arrived on Triton. He wasn\u2019t much of a chatter, but it was also strange for him to be completely silent.Buar tried to demand, \u201cHey, tell us if you know something\u2014\u201dBut Nwiar cut him off short by pulling on his arm, \u201cBig brother.\u201dYuWon didn\u2019t say anything even though he should have heard Buar. He looked incredibly focused on something.[The test will commence in 10 minutes.]The test start message popped up.The lower part of Triton was the entrance to the testing site, and Buar and Nwiar were not allowed to walk up higher than this.\u201cI\u2019ll be back,\u201d YuWon told them.\u201cAh, okay,\u201d Buar said while waving his hand, \u201cSee ya later.\u201d\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about things over here too much,\u201d Nwiar told YuWon.Their faces were full of confidence.They were the most skilled among the young Giants. They weren\u2019t the children of the Giant Gods just for show. As long as they weren\u2019t up against Rankers, there was no need to worry about them.Step, step\u2014YuWon started to climb up the island, and Buar and Nwiar watched him walk away into the distance.When YuWon was no longer visible, Buar said out loud, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys come out?\u201d\u201cPlease stop hiding like rats and let me see your faces.\u201dBuar and Nwiar looked around and spotted the people hiding in the seagrass.One by one, they revealed themselves. There were quite a few of them.\u2018The Elder was right,\u2019 Buar thought, thinking back to how Urpha told them that Olympus would be aiming for YuWon.\u201cWould you look at this,\u201d one of the guys that was hiding said to the siblings.\u201cLook at them standing proud and mighty.\u201d\u201cDid they just call us rats?\u201dThere were about forty people, and mixed among them were familiar faces.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while,\u201d Buar said to Horang, the red-haired fellow.\u201cYou\u2019re acting very different from the last time we met. What happened to the guy that was cowering in fear?\u201d\u201cThings have changed,\u201d Buar said, smashing his two fists together.A hard sound rang throughout the air, as if he just hit two pieces of metal together.\u201cThis time, I plan on fighting,\u201d Buar declared.Until now, Buar had lived by keeping himself out of fights because he didn\u2019t want to ruin the poor reputation of the Giants even more.That was also the will of Urpha, the Grand Elder of the Giants.However\u2026\u201cThis time, you must fight. No,\u201d Urpha told them, \u201cFrom now on\u2026 you must always fight.\u201dSmirk\u2014That was the best news Buar had ever received in his life.\u201cYou sound like you think you can win as long as you get to fight,\u201d Horang spoke.\u201cYou heard me right.\u201dStomp\u2014A loud step rumbled the ground.Horang and his gang looked to the side and spotted three Giants approaching them.\u201cAre you the one that\u2019s been bullying our friend?\u201d Kwant said, walking up with two other Giants.A total of five Giants, including Buar and Nwiar, had gathered together. They were greatly outnumbered, but their presence rivaled the 40 players.\u201cWell, ain\u2019t this a big haul.\u201d Horang smiled at the arrival of three more Giants.Because Olympus was greatly interested in the capture of Giants, to Horang, the five in front of him seemed like some big catch.\u201cKeep at least one or two of them alive. We might be able to use them as hostages later,\u201d Horang ordered his men.There were many ways to use the Giants, but the primary objective of this mission was eliminating Kim YuWon. Since Horang had confirmed that he and the Giants were together, the Giants could serve as potential hostages against them.\u201cGroup 2,\u201d Horang said.\u201cYes, sir!\u201d\u201cFollow YuWon up. Take him out before he reaches the test site.\u201d\u201cYes, si\u2014\u201dWhoosh\u2014Grip\u2014!\u201cKgh!\u201dIn a flash, Buar had grabbed one of them by the neck. He was now standing in front of the hill that YuWon had climbed.\u201cWhere do you guys think you\u2019re going?\u201d Buar asked.Squeeze\u2014\u201cK-Kgh\u2026\u201dBuar smiled while crushing the breath out of the man in his grasp and lifting him up. \u201cYou guys need to play with me.\u201d* * *Slam\u2014!A loud noise occurred at the base of the island.It was the sound of something heavy falling.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is there a fight somewhere?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s coming from down there.\u201d\u201cOutside the test site?\u201d\u201cJust leave it. It\u2019s better for us if other competitors fight amongst themselves.\u201d\u201cI guess.\u201dFights between players were nothing special. And once you reached around the 20th Floor, fights on a big scale were pretty common occurrences, especially right before a test.The participants of the test ignored the fight below, not really caring about it.\u2018They\u2019re being loud,\u2019 Theseus thought, his face twitching ever so slightly.He had specifically ordered them to take care of it quietly.\u2018Luckily, none of them seem to care.\u2019It was now time to start the test.Seeing as how YuWon was not here yet, it meant that the Crimson Wolf Guild had successfully managed to hold back Kim YuWon.They had successfully achieved their first objective.\u2018At least they\u2019re somewhat useful.\u2019Theseus didn\u2019t think that the Crimson Wolf Guild was capable of taking out YuWon. It would have been great if they could, but it was hard to expect them to win against someone who had managed to win against a Ranker on the 11th Floor.Their job was merely to buy time. If they could just stop YuWon from participating in this test, they would have served their purpose.\u2018Turn the Lackeys\u2019 focus towards the test site and take out YuWon.\u2019Theseus checked the time with his player kit.There were less than three minutes left until midnight, the start time for the test.Tik-tok\u2014And so, it was almost time for the test to start.That was when\u2026[We\u2019re sorry, sir.]A message came to Theseus\u2019s player kit.It was from Horang, an executive of the Crimson Wolf Guild that should have been fighting below.[YuWon managed to escape from us.]\u2018They let him escape\u2026?\u2019Theseus quickly looked through the faces of the participants.He tried to find YuWon\u2019s face among the hundred or so of them. It was a large number, but not too large for him to quickly look through them. But\u2026\u2018He\u2019s not here.\u2019YuWon, who should have arrived, was nowhere to be seen.\u2018Where did he go?\u2019Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Leveling with the GodsCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 97Chapter 97Shwaaa\u2014Small waves crashed into the cliff, scattering into countless water drops.YuWon was sitting atop the cliff at the edge of the island, looking down.\u2018It\u2019s almost time.\u2019YuWon got up after checking the time.It wasn\u2019t the official starting location of the test, but it didn\u2019t matter since YuWon was still technically within the range of the test site.He wouldn\u2019t be able to listen to the explanation of the test, but it was fine since he remembered the contents of the 20th Floor\u2019s test.[Commencing the 20th Floor\u2019s test.][There are various sea monsters living on the small island of Triton.][For the next 12 hours, kill the monsters and obtain \u2018Hearts of the Sea.\u2019][Depending on the number of \u2018Hearts of the Sea\u2019 you collect, you will be awarded additional contribution points.]The basic premise of the 20th Floor\u2019s test was similar to the 11th Floor\u2019s test, just that instead of flags, you had to get \u300cHearts of the Sea.\u300dThe major differences were that the stage was an island, the difficulty of the monsters was greater, and you were evaluated as an individual.But with those small differences, the test was like something entirely different.The 20th Floor was one of the major crossroads for players.\u2018This is where tests start becoming team-oriented,\u2019 YuWon thought.The monsters on the island were far too strong for players on the 20th Floors to kill alone. You needed at least a group of four or five people to defeat a single one, which meant that players had to team up, whether they liked it or not.In addition, unlike the 11th Floor\u2019s test, there was no restriction on how many people could pass. On the 20th Floor\u2019s test, there was no reason for people to divide into opposing factions.And thus players, realizing that it was more convenient to be a part of a group, started forming proper teams.That was why the 20th Floor was known as a crossroad for players.The team formation was also why players gathered up at the same location for the beginning of the test.However\u2026\u201cI feel a bit bad for them,\u201d YuWon said.He had no intention of just peacefully participating in the test.He slowly tilted his body downwards.Crash\u2014Turbulent waves were colliding against the cliff.YuWon closed his eyes as his body plunged into the water and slowly sank.\u2018Because everyone except me is going to fail.\u2019* * *\u201cYou over there!\u201d\u201cFall back! Send in the next group!\u201d\u201cLast just a little bit longer!\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019re ready! You guys, fall back!\u201dThe hunting had started all across the island. Players were grouped up into teams of eight to fifteen people.Theseus watched them hunt Sea Serpents through the screen on his player kit.\u201cWhat about Kim YuWon? Have you found him yet?\u201d Theseus asked.\u201cWe\u2019re still searching for him.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s a no.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, sir.\u201d\u201cIf you have time to be sorry, you have time to search. Assign more men to the task.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dThe test assistants moved according to Theseus\u2019s orders.Even the mighty Olympus didn\u2019t have the authority to let random Rankers come in and out of the testing site. Fortunately for Theseus, among the Rankers he managed, there were quite a few people with search skills.There was one thing that bothered him.\u2018How are they unable to find one person on this tiny island?\u2019 Theseus wondered.It had been hours since the start of the test, yet they still hadn\u2019t found YuWon.There was nothing he could do during the test, but it still bothered him that his plans were crumbling to pieces.\u201cDid he run away?\u201dTheseus couldn\u2019t rule that possibility out.YuWon should have been aware that he was an enemy of Olympus. It wouldn\u2019t have been the strangest thing if he\u2019d decided to bolt after he was threatened by the Crimson Wolf Guild before the test event started.\u2018But is he the type to do that?\u2019There wasn\u2019t much Theseus knew about YuWon, but there were a few things that made him hesitant to think that YuWon might have run away.\u2018He joined hands with the Giants.\u2019He had heard from the Crimson Wolf Guild that YuWon and the Giants met up, which allowed Olympus to prepare a trap, knowing ahead of time that YuWon was planning on participating in this test.But Theseus was greatly puzzled. Things didn\u2019t add up, even if he did help a few Giant kids.\u2018Why? No, more like how?\u2019Giants had a deep-seated hatred against humans thanks to what humans did during the Gigantomachy. Due to the war, more than half of the Giants were killed, making them still hostile to humans after all this time. But, worried about a second Gigantomachy breaking out, Giants typically kept that hatred to themselves\u2026So it was definitely strange that YuWon had managed to join forces with the Giants because the relationship between humans and Giants should have been irreparable after the Gigantomachy.\u2018Could it be?\u2019A thought came to him.\u201cThe Giants are hiding the Stone of the Sea,\u201d Theseus\u2019s father, Poseidon, had told him. \u201cZeus said to avoid getting into another war with the Giants until the next Gigantomachy, but that doesn\u2019t mean we should sit around and do nothing.\u201dPoseidon had a great obsession for the Stone of the Sea. It was to a point that he was willing to go against the orders from Zeus, the King of Olympus.\u201cWhile you\u2019re acting as the test examiner, find the Stone. If you manage to do that, I shall acknowledge you as my son.\u201dBeing an illegitimate son, that was an offer Theseus could not resist.Poseidon was one of the \u201cBig Three\u201d gods of Olympus, and being acknowledged as his son meant that he would become the official successor of the Sea God.\u2018There\u2019s no way Father would have false information. I\u2019m certain that the Giants do have the Stone.\u2019That was why Theseus cared more about capturing the Giants alive than about Yuwon. He honestly didn\u2019t care about YuWon as long as he could find the \u300cStone of the Sea.\u300dOr at least that\u2019s what he had originally thought\u2026A thought crept up on Theseus. \u2018Is Kim YuWon related somehow?\u2019A human had managed to move with Giants, and Giants had started to come out of the forest.The picture he had first had in mind was wiped away, and a new picture started to come into place. But as of yet, he couldn\u2019t see the full picture.That was when\u2026Rumble, rumble\u2014The ground below him started to shake, as if an earthquake was happening.In that moment, Theseus recollected countless pieces of information.\u201c\u2026 Was that what it was?\u201d Theseus said while smirking.It was an enigma as to why after so much searching, they couldn\u2019t find the stone.He wondered where it could be and if the Giants even really possessed the Stone. And if the Giants did have the Stone, why didn\u2019t they use it during the Gigantomachy?The answer to all of it lied here.Beep\u2014Theseus pulled out his player kit and made a call.As an old habit, he politely put his hands together as he waited for the call to go through.After a moment, Theseus bowed in the direction of the player kit.He spoke, \u201cGreetings. I know it\u2019s been a while, but\u2026\u201dVwoom\u2014A screen popped up.Theseus\u2019s voice trembled as it was a face he hadn\u2019t seen in a long time.\u201cI think I\u2019ve finally found it,\u201d Theseus said while raising his head, \u201cFather.\u201d* * *The 20th Floor test was progressing smoothly.Like every test before, players diligently hunted the sea monsters, collecting \u300cHearts of the Sea.\u300d Almost half the players had managed to obtain a \u300cHeart of the Sea\u300d for themselves.Thud\u2014Another Sea Serpent fell.One of the teammates who was rummaging through the corpse of the Sea Serpent shouted, \u201cI found it!\u201dHe raised a clear blue crystal up in the air. It was a \u300cHeart of the Sea,\u300d which was required to pass the test.\u201cThat\u2019s one more for the books.\u201d\u201cThis is pretty easy.\u201d\u201cHow many is that?\u201d\u201c15.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all we need. What do we do now?\u201dTheir team had 15 people, and they had managed to get a \u300cHeart of the Sea\u300d for each person.Akail, the leader of the team, checked the remaining time.[06 : 18 : 21]There was still more than half the amount of time left. At this rate, it might even be possible to get an extra heart for each person.\u2018Not bad,\u2019 Akail thought to himself.They were teammates that he had been working with since the 10th Floor. Their synergy was good, and each person had solid skills. But that wasn\u2019t really all that much of a surprise since they were all players being sponsored by Olympus.\u2018Passing the test is now confirmed, so\u2026\u2019Akail looked around.Vwoom\u2014From the beginning of the test, he had placed a floating \u2018eye\u2019 above the island, looking with his search skill for a single person\u2014Kim YuWon.\u2018Where did he go?\u2019 he wondered.Olympus had given a direct order to find and take out YuWon.This was, of course, an impossible task.They might have been players that were fairly well-known on the 20th Floor, but it was ridiculous to ask them to try and defeat YuWon with just a team of 15 people.\u2018It\u2019ll be better for us if he doesn\u2019t appear.\u2019They\u2019d still be scolded afterwards, but as long as they made an attempt to find YuWon, it was better for them if YuWon didn\u2019t appear.Taking a breather after defeating a Sea Serpent, the teammates started chatting, feeling bored.Akail got up from his spot while watching them.\u201cDid you guys all get enough rest?\u201d he asked his team.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re all rested and ready!\u201d\u201cShould we get going?\u201dWith no one injured and their passing being basically confirmed, they were all feeling strongly motivated.Akail nodded his head, and his teammates started getting up.\u201cWe\u2019ll now split up into two groups, and\u2014\u201dThat was when\u2026Boom\u2014!Shwaaaa\u2014\u2026 Water burst up from below the cliffs.The team responded nimbly.\u201cSomething\u2019s coming!\u201d\u201cGet ready!\u201d\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d\u201cAnother Sea Serpent?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s too small for that!\u201dThe \u2018something\u2019 that shot up with the seawater was too small to be any monster that appeared on the island. Even the smallest monsters were at least three to four meters in size, and Sea Serpents were dozens of meters long.It looked like it might have been a man at best.\u201cWait\u2026 It\u2019s a person!\u201dThe person landed safely on the ground.The man had wet black hair that looked similar to seaweed, and he wore red clothes.\u2018Who is this guy?\u2019 Akail wondered.It was hard to recognize the man because he looked like a wet dog with his wet hair partially obscuring his face.\u2018He looks like a player and not a monster. So why did he come up from the sea\u2026?\u2019 Akail wondered.Then it hit him.It was odd. The water under the island was a danger zone crawling with monsters like the Sea Serpents which took his team of 15 people to take down. And because it was underwater, it was extra difficult for players to hunt there.So naturally, Akail\u2019s mind went to a single person.\u201cCould it be\u2026?\u201d Akail blurted.The face hidden by the hair started to slowly reveal itself.The man looked a bit different due to his hair being wet, but the face was the same.\u201cKim YuWon?\u201d Akail said in disbelief.\u201cIs that really YuWon?\u201d\u201cWhy did he pop out from the sea\u2026?\u201dAkail\u2019s teammates were all stunned by YuWon\u2019s sudden appearance.YuWon said, \u201cAre you guys from Olympus?\u201dAkail shivered as a chill went down his spine. How did YuWon know their affiliation?YuWon was right, but neither Akail nor his teammates could say yes. They instead all remained silent, worried that the moment they said yes, they might all lose their heads.The Olympian players were all frozen stiff.YuWon turned around and spoke with his back to the players, \u201cI don\u2019t want to fight you guys, so you don\u2019t have to be so scared.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d Akail was confused.He wondered if YuWon was going to just let them go.He had heard that YuWon and Olympus were not on good terms. But seeing as how YuWon was facing away from them, he must really have no intention of fighting them.He was a bit relieved that YuWon was going to let them go, but that wasn\u2019t all good news for Akail.\u2018If we run from here\u2026\u2019 Akail weighed his options, \u2018we\u2019ll probably be punished by Theseus.\u2019There was also a chance that they might lose all support from Olympus.YuWon interrupted his thinking, saying, \u201cBecause even if you don\u2019t want to fight, you\u2019ll have to fight soon.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Akail exclaimed.\u201cWhat do you mean by tha\u2014?\u201d one of his teammates tried to ask before being interrupted by the ground trembling.Akail sensed that something was off.That was when\u2026Shwaaaa\u2014Something burst up from the sea near the island.It was a creature he was familiar with.\u2018A Sea Serpent?\u2019 Akail scrutinized.It was a monster that lived in the sea with a body length of over ten meters and the most common monster one could encounter on the 20th Floor.But then\u2026\u201cHow many\u2026\u201d Akail slowly spoke.Whoosh, whoosh\u2014His voice trembled seeing what was unfolding in front of his very eyes, \u201c\u2026 Are there?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were also Sea Grizzlies, Ichthyosaurs, and other monsters headed towards the island.How many was that? Hundreds? Thousands? Tens of thousands?\u2018Kim YuWon is no longer the problem,\u2019 Akail thought.This test was doomed.Even YuWon wouldn\u2019t be able to handle all these monsters. It shouldn\u2019t even be possible for a Ranker. It may have been possible for a High Ranker, but for now, running was the best option.\u201cE-Everyone, run away from the island!\u201d Akail ordered.If you left the testing site before the time limit, you were automatically disqualified from the test, but that was the least of their problems right now. Surviving was the utmost priority, and other players on the island agreed.\u201cGet off the island!\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the examiner?\u201d\u201cShouldn\u2019t he appear at moments like this?!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with this test!\u201dThe test was broken, and the participants no longer saw a meaning in taking it.Players on the island started running for their lives while looking for the examiner. They thought that the Rankers in charge of overseeing the test might have been able to protect them somehow. However\u2026\u201cNo,\u201d YuWon said in a bold tone, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong here.\u201dAkail, after making sure his teammates had gotten out first, was also about to take his leave when he heard YuWon.\u201c\u2026 What?\u201d Akail said in confusion.\u201cThings are just finally going the way it was meant to be,\u201d YuWon continued.Rumble, rumble\u2014The whole island shook again.YuWon looked down at the island, continuing his monologue, \u201cGoing back to its original form.\u201dAkail didn\u2019t know what YuWon was saying, but he could instinctively feel that YuWon was at the center of this commotion.And after hearing YuWon, Akail noticed the system\u2019s message.[The test is being reorganized.]Reorganized?Akail had never heard of such a thing before.\u2018It\u2019s not that the test is broken\u2026\u2019 Akail realized.Instead, the test itself was changing, which was why the test examiner wasn\u2019t interfering.Unless there was a special error or there was interference by someone who was not a player in the test, a test examiner would not butt in.\u2018What about this\u2026?\u2019 Akail wondered while pulling out the blue gem in his pocket.The gem that glowed blue was the token necessary to pass this test, but there was a chance that if the test changed, the gem would be no better than just a pretty rock.\u2018No, that\u2019s not what\u2019s important right now,\u2019 Akail changed his line of thought.Thinking could come later. What mattered right now was surviving.Akail turned around and quickly got out of there.YuWon mumbled while looking at Akail run down to the bottom of the island, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to do that though.\u201dThe test had been completely flipped, meaning he\u2019d completed step one.\u201cNow then\u2026\u201d YuWon said.Vzzzzt\u2014A black light started flowing out of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300d\u201cNow the problem is how long I can last against these guys.\u201d* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 Yu x YuProofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn* * *\u201cOw, ow, ow, ow\u2026\u201d Kwant winced while having medicine applied to his shoulder.Annoyed by Kwant\u2019s reaction, Buar stopped rubbing the ointment and smacked Kwant\u2019s arm instead.\u201cThen why did you come here? Your arm\u2019s not even fully healed!\u201d Buar berated Kwant.\u201cThat\u2019s rich coming from a guy that would have died if not for us,\u201d Kwant retorded.Buar defended himself, \u201cWe would have won even without you guys.\u201d\u201cBig brother,\u201d Nwiar said while shaking her head, having overheard their conversation. \u201cThat\u2019s a lie.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Buar, who was trying to be prideful, looked the other way in silence.They were surrounded by corpses of players from the Crimson Wolf Guild.Horang, who was leading them, had run away, and Vulkan and Kwant ended up wounded.\u201cI don\u2019t know what his name is, but that red-haired guy was pretty strong.\u201d\u201cIf Nwiar hadn\u2019t been the one going up against him, it would have been bad.\u201d\u201cIt was hard for me as well. I\u2019m just glad that you guys took care of the other enemies quickly and came to support me. I wouldn\u2019t have lasted much longer by myself.\u201dWithin the Crimson Wolf Guild, Horang\u2019s skills were outstanding. If the Crimson Wolf Guild had brought just a few more players and if Horang was just slightly more skilled, the Giants might have been the ones who lost.Rumble, rumble\u2014The island started shaking.All the Giants were players that had previously passed the 20th Floor\u2019s test, and none of them recalled something like this happening.\u201cThis test is strange\u2026\u201d Nwiar said.The other Giants nodded in agreement. Something was definitely off.To begin with, it was abnormal for a guild to send people to hunt a single player.Urpha must have anticipated this, having sent them to help Yuwon.And now, while YuWon was taking the test, the island had started to change.\u201cCould it be\u2026?\u201d Nwiar said while watching the thousands of Sea Serpents rear their heads out of the water. \u201cHe might have actually found it.\u201dThe sea monsters all roared in unison. But the roars didn\u2019t sound like they were filled with rage or hunger. Instead, it sounded as if they were longing for something and cheering something on.\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d a voice came from behind the group.Step\u2014Nwiar turned her head after hearing the familiar voice.Horang, who had run away after losing in the fight, had returned.\u201cHe must have actually found it,\u201d he said.His face was filled with lustful greed, and he looked much more confident.\u201cHe who holds the Stone of the Sea will gain the power of a god.\u201d Horang continued.Behind Horang, dozens of players gathered around him.\u201cOlympus is searching for the Stone of the Sea. We have nothing to be afraid of here,\u201d Horang said.\u201cSo you\u2019re doing all this just to be Olympus\u2019s dog?\u201d\u201cSo what if I am?\u201d\u201cThere is a test currently going on. Nothing good will come to you by creating too big of a commotion.\u201d\u201cI can worry about that later.\u201dSeeing an opportunity, Horang was now hyper-fixated on his chance. This also applied to the other players of the Crimson Wolf Guild he brought with him.Nwiar stood in the front and asked, \u201cDid you come back so you can finally die?\u201dHorang had already had a bout with her, and he realized that five Giants were hard to handle even with the larger number of players he had on his side.But things were different this time.\u201cSorry, but I\u2019m not your opponent this time,\u201d Horang said while taking a step back.He then bowed to the man standing next to him, \u201cPlease, sir.\u201dA man hiding half of his face with a mask stepped in front. He was emitting such an ominous presence, Nwiar could instinctively feel that this man was dangerous.\u201cThey even brought a Ranker?\u201d Nwiar wondered.His presence was not that of an ordinary player. Not to mention, Horang, a pretty highly skilled player, was showing this man respect.\u201cThat motherfucker was right,\u201d Kwant laughed while holding onto his injured arm. \u201cThis fight is going to be a big one.\u201dThud\u2014One side of the island shook. It was different from the earlier shaking.There was a sound of something heavy falling.Thud, thud, thud\u2014There was a succession of the same noise.Horang and the other players from his guild froze while looking around.\u201cG-Giants?\u201d\u201cHow are they so big\u2026?\u201d\u201cIs that a\u2026 Ranker?\u201dGiants towering over four meters tall stood with a glare.Giant Rankers had arrived at the island.\u201cWe came as ordered by the Elder.\u201dThud\u2014A Ranker of the Giants and the 21st son of Surtr, Suhtahr led the Giants, \u201cWe will now commence with the support of player Kim YuWon.\u201d* * *\u2018So it\u2019s begun,\u2019 YuWon thought while watching the fight break out at the bottom of the island using his [Cinder Eyes.]He was quite far away, but because the Giants were so big, it wasn\u2019t hard to see what was going on.\u2018Seeing how Suhtahr is here, they must be betting on this big time.\u2019Urpha was the only one who knew where the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d was hidden.He was also the one who had experienced Poseidon\u2019s strength firsthand more than anyone else during the Gigantomachy, which is why he had no intention of handing over the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d to Olympus.\u2018Olympus should have noticed by now.\u2019Olympus had been in search of the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d for a really long time.Zeus had ordered them to avoid confrontation with the Giants, but Poseidon had continued to exert his influence on the 20th Floor in search of the Stone.That was how they ended up figuring out that the Stone was hidden on the tiny island of Triton, but the reason why they hadn\u2019t managed to get their hands on it yet was because the island was the stage for the Administrator\u2019s test.\u2018There\u2019s no way Olympus would miss that the test changed.\u2019YuWon guessed that Theseus was currently revving up.From a trap set to catch a single player, they were about to capture the treasure they were after for so long. And with the Giants here, they should have been fairly certain of what was going on.\u201cThey\u2019re really good at catching wind of things.\u201dHissss\u2014!YuWon asked the Sea Serpents that were right in front of him, \u201cDon\u2019t you agree?\u201dGnaw\u2014A Sea Serpent opened its mouth. The fishy scent of the sea reeked from its mouth.YuWon swung his sword in response.Slice\u2014The Sea Serpent\u2019s head was cut off.Splurt\u2014!From its neck, blood gushed out.YuWon mumbled while wiping the blood off his sword, \u201cI don\u2019t know why I asked when you can\u2019t answer.\u201dSea Serpents and countless other sea monsters climbed onto the island. A few of them rushed towards YuWon, while most didn\u2019t.Grrrr\u2014Hiss\u2014Most of the monsters wandered the island, sniffing and looking around.They were looking for something.Whoosh\u2014Slash\u2014YuWon cut down the monsters flooding in. He cut them down one after another, but the influx of monsters persisted.\u2018When will they make their move?\u2019YuWon couldn\u2019t leave the island. The moment he left, there would no longer be any more players on the test site, and the test would automatically be considered \u2018invalid.\u2019 The moment that happened, this would no longer be his stage.So he continued to endure it, and a few minutes passed like that.Twitch\u2014YuWon felt a bit of movement from the ground.It had been moving for a bit now, but it seemed that it was taking a while for it to really wake up from its \u2018slumber.\u2019\u201cThis sleepyhead\u2026\u201d YuWon said with a smile on his face.It was finally the moment he was waiting for.The monsters that were going on a rampage stopped, all looked in the same direction, and howled as if they were in a trance.Rumble, rumble\u2014The tip of the island started to move.YuWon saw the \u2018head\u2019 that revealed itself.Rumble, rumble\u2014Crack, crack\u2014The ground shook and split, revealing a hard, black shell underneath.The head opened its mouth which had been shut for a long time.\u201cAwoooo\u2014!\u201d[The Sea Turtle has appeared.][The body of the Sea Turtle has been designated as the test site.][Defeat the Sea Turtle and obtain the Stone of the Sea.]Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The shell of a Sea Turtle is so hard, even most High Rankers would have a hard time breaking it.\u201d\u201cSo in order to aim for its stomach, I have to jump into the sea,\u201d YuWon noted.\u201cThat\u2019s right, which is a suicidal act.\u201dThe sea of the 20th Floor was the biggest dungeon in the Tower. Countless monsters lived in its waters. The \u2018sea\u2019 of this world had more monsters than fish.Yet here he was telling a player, not even a Ranker, to enter those kinds of waters.\u201cThink you can do it?\u201d Urpha asked.\u201cYes, I can,\u201d YuWon answered without even a hint of hesitation.Urpha smiled after hearing that, his faith in YuWon boosted by his brazen confidence.Urpha continued to explain, \u201cThe stomach of the Sea Turtle has an emblem that looks like a cross between a sun and a star. That\u2019s the seal of the Sea Turtle and the reason the turtle allows itself to act as an island.\u201d\u201cSo will the test start if I erase the seal?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Urpha answered with a serious look on his face, \u201cand the moment the Sea Turtle fully reveals itself, the test\u2019s difficulty will change greatly.\u201dYuWon nodded his head. It was an obvious statement.\u201cBecause the reward will be the Stone of the Sea, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. The difficulty will be no breeze in the park. It might even ask you to defeat the Sea Turtle.\u201dAs ridiculous as that sounded, it was within the realm of possibilities.The tests in the Tower were based around \u2018rewards\u2019 that corresponded to \u2018difficulty.\u2019 And the higher the difficulty, the more valuable the rewards were. This meant that if you knew how good a reward was, you could somewhat gauge the difficulty. And the \u300cStone of the Sea\u300d was a precious item indeed.\u201cAnd that\u2019s when Olympus will no longer be able to interfere with the test. Because the test will no longer be administered by them but by the Administrator.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t they just try and steal it from me after the test?\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t be standing around just watching that happen,\u201d Urpha said.That was something Yuwon wanted to hear.Urpha was clenching his fist. He was called a pacifist by his own people, but it was all for the survival of the Giants. For his people, Urpha was more than capable of fighting through fire if necessary.\u201cThat\u2019s good to hear,\u201d YuWon said, nodding his head, satisfied with the promise of the Giants keeping him safe.And this was a promise YuWon knew Urpha would keep as he didn\u2019t want the Stone to fall into Poseidon\u2019s hands.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d YuWon still had a lingering question. \u201cHow do you know all this?\u201dYuWon only knew that Urpha had the key to the test, but he didn\u2019t know how Urpha came to know this information.\u201cThat\u2019s because the one who raised that turtle\u2026\u201d Urpha said while reminiscing on the past, \u201cfed it the stone, and put it to sleep was me.\u201d* * *[You\u2019ve been forcibly kicked out the test for not meeting the requirements.]That was the message everyone on the island got at the same time.Suhtahr, the Giant Ranker, looked around the suddenly changed scenery.The island of Triton, the test location, was now far off in the distance.Except it was no longer an island.\u201cWoooo~ Awooooo\u2014!!\u201dThe loud cry was powerful enough to blow a hole in the clouds.It was a creature that was almost 10km long.The presence the creature exuded even pressured Suhtahr.Suhtahr only knew of a single turtle this big.\u2018A Sea Turtle,\u2019 he thought to himself.These monsters were one of the greatest beings in this sea, nicknamed \u201cTurtles that failed to become a Black Tortoise*,\u201d and they were also known as the rulers of the 20th Floor.*TL/N: The Black Tortoise is one of the Four Symbols of the Chinese Constellations, along with the Azure Dragon, Vermillion Bird, and White Tiger.\u2018But are they normally this big?\u2019 Suhtahr wondered.Sea Turtles were normally pretty big, with some being as large as one kilometer long. And their shells were so sturdy, they could even withstand attacks from Rankers.They were monsters that people thought shouldn\u2019t exist on the 20th Floor because of how strong they were.Still, this one was much too large in size.\u201cIt\u2019s probably thanks to the Stone of the Sea,\u201d a voice spoke behind Suhtahr.He turned around to see a blue-haired man descending while riding a bird. He was someone that Suhtahr was very familiar with.\u201cLong time no see, Suhtahr.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t think we were on such good terms to casually greet each other, Theseus.\u201dSuhtahr and Theseus had a history of having fought against each other long ago during the Gigantomachy.\u201cI heard you were living the good life after becoming a test examiner, so why are you here? Shouldn\u2019t you be looking over the testing site?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because it\u2019s so noisy out here. What about you guys? Why are the Giants causing a ruckus near the testing site?\u201d\u201cMy guys were having a bit of a hard time against that Ranker, so I decided to give a helping hand. Why? Do you have a problem with that?\u201dSuhtahr\u2019s response made Theseus look over at the Crimson Wolf Guild.Standing amidst the Crimson Wolf Guild was their vice-guildmaster, Mukrang. He was someone that had recently joined the Crimson Wolf Guild after becoming a Ranker, and it was his participation that gave Giants justification.\u201c\u2026 There is no problem,\u201d Theseus answered.The only things the Giants did were in self-defense, so Theseus had no grounds to attack them.After thinking hard for a minute, all Theseus could say was, \u201cHowever, I will prohibit causing any more commotion. Don\u2019t forget, we are in the middle of a test, Suhtahr.\u201dSuhtahr smirked. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear that from people who will throw that rule out the window at the first sign of inconvenience.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t back down if you want a fight, but heed my words\u2026\u201d Theseus spoke.The waves crashed onto the shore, following Theseus\u2019s will.\u201cNo one is allowed to interfere with the test, no matter who they might be,\u201d Theseus warned.Multiple Rankers arrived. They were the other examiners that oversaw the test.Suhtahr looked back and forth between the Giant Rankers and the test examiners.The test was not over yet, and as a test examiner, Theseus was unlikely to try and pull something while the test was still in progress.Olympus was already walking on eggshells, so trying something here would be too great of a risk for them.But that didn\u2019t mean the Giants had free reign to do whatever. Messing with a test examiner mid-test would be a direct challenge of an Administrator\u2019s authority.\u2018Neither side can interfere with the test or make the first move right now,\u2019 Suhtahr thought while looking at the Sea Turtle that was wailing from being woken from its slumber. \u2018Now all that\u2019s left is for him to safely pass the test.\u2019* * *Reaper ScansTranslator \u2013 Yu x YuProofreader \u2013 BringTheRayn* * *[Defeat the Sea Turtle and obtain the Stone of the Sea.]YuWoon double-checked the contents of the test.It was an unbelievable test.Sea Turtles were monsters that even Rankers had difficulty defeating, and this one was many times bigger than normal Sea Turtles. It was to a point that it had been mistaken for a small island all this time.\u2018Did it become this big because of the Divine Sea Crystal? It doesn\u2019t look like a normal mutant,\u2019 YuWon thought.After making his way inside the Sea Turtle\u2019s mouth, YuWon started slowly finding his way through.It was impossible to defeat the Sea Turtle the way the message was asking him to.No matter how much YuWon racked his brain, he couldn\u2019t think of a way. Piercing the shell of a Sea Turtle this big was improbable, and cutting through its tough skin was going to be no small feat either.That meant there was only one option. To get inside the Sea Turtle and find the \u300cDivine Sea Crystal.\u300dThe objective of the test was to take down the Sea Turtle and obtain the Stone, but YuWon decided to interpret it a little differently.\u2018If I obtain the Divine Sea Crystal, I might be able to defeat the Sea Turtle.\u2019That made Yuwon think the test wasn\u2019t going to be that hard. The place was large, but all he had to do was find the Sea Crystal, and he had a pretty good treasure map for this treasure hunt.Unfortunately, there was a problem.Hiss\u2014!A small dragon with blue scales charged at YuWon.It was an Aqua Dragon. Being one of the more powerful creatures in the sea, it was both strong and large in size.Klang\u2014!Scrape\u2014While standing on the Sea Turtle\u2019s tongue, YuWon managed to block the Aqua Dragon\u2019s teeth with his sword.Turned out, YuWon wasn\u2019t the only one that had managed to find their way inside.Fwoosh\u2014The [Holy Fire] enveloped YuWon\u2019s sword.YuWon decided to no longer conserve mana since he was now inside the Sea Turtle\u2019s body.[Under the influence of darkness, your Stamina regeneration speed increases.][Stamina Regeneration Speed : +112%][Under the influence of darkness, your mana regeneration speed increases.][Health Regeneration Speed : +56%][Under the influence of darkness, your mana amplification increases.][Mana amplification: +56%]The inside of the Sea Turtle was pitch black, which meant that YuWon\u2019s sword increased his mana regeneration and amplification.On top of that\u2026Vzzzzzt\u2014!Black mana started flowing out of \u300cKyne\u0113.\u300dWhoosh\u2014!It tore apart the Aqua Dragon that attacked him.As the Aqua Dragon was reduced to pieces, YuWon jumped up in the air to avoid getting splattered in blood.He then used [Cinder Eyes] to widen his field of vision in the dark.\u2018Quite a few managed to get in.\u2019There was more than just a single Aqua Dragon. Among the horde of monsters, there were a handful of Aqua Dragons mixed in, but only a few of them were hostile to YuWon. The majority of them were entering the Sea Turtle\u2019s mouth and allowing themselves to get swallowed up.\u2018Are they willingly becoming food for the Sea Turtle?\u2019The dominance of the \u300cDivine Sea Crystal\u300d was stronger than YuWon expected. It was to the point that sea monsters were offering their own lives.Then YuWon remembered the legend passed down on the 20th Floor.\u201cHe who finds the Stone of the Sea will become the god of the sea.\u201dIt was no mere legend. Right now, the Sea Turtle was like an actual god of the sea.\u201cAwoooo\u2014!\u201dThe Sea Turtle\u2019s cry echoed inside its mouth.YuWon felt like his eardrums were going to burst.\u2018It\u2019s too loud. I can\u2019t stay here anymore.\u2019YuWon started walking deeper inside.The inside of the Sea Turtle felt like the dark ocean floor. It reeked of that salty, fishy smell, and there were myriad sea monsters swimming around as if this was their new home.But not all the monsters there were new.\u2018Some of these guys must have been in here for a while.\u2019It appeared that the inside of the Sea Turtle had been a dungeon for a long time. There were a lot of monsters that had come in from the outside, but there were also a number of monsters that looked like they\u2019d settled down long ago.Rush\u2014Salt water flowed in through the Sea Turtle\u2019s mouth, and the floor became wet.A horde of black creatures stopped YuWon in his tracks.\u201cGrrrrr\u2014\u201d\u201cGrowl\u2014\u201dThe monsters inside the Sea Turtle weren\u2019t only volunteering to be its food, but they also seemed to serve as its minions.\u201cAre you telling me I can\u2019t go any further?\u201dVwoom\u2014\u300cKyne\u0113\u300d let out a soft cry. The \u300cDivine Dark Crystal\u300d equipped on it was responding to the \u300cDivine Sea Crystal.\u300dInside the Sea Turtle\u2019s large body, YuWon could approximate the location of the Sea Crystal.And now, while on his way to the crystal, monsters were blocking his path.\u201cDo you guys think I\u2019m a virus or something?\u201dYuWon was the only creature present not under the \u300cDivine Sea Crystal\u2019s\u300d influence, which was why the Sea Turtle registered YuWon as a virus.Tmp, tmp\u2014Despite that, YuWon did not stop his march forward.There was only one path here, and there was no point running when his destination was already decided.\u2018There will be no retreating.\u2019YuWon didn\u2019t have to conserve his stamina or mana.Vzzzt\u2014The glove on his right hand, \u300cKyne\u0113,\u300d glowed black.\u2018I\u2019m going to blitz through.\u2019Boom\u2014!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
