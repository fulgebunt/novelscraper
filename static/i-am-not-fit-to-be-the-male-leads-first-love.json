    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1 \u2013 The Golden Finger (2)Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s lotus words were the same as shown in the script\u2026 Chu Yin\u2019s heart warmed slightly, and the glowing pen tip hung in the air, as if she could easily control the characters in the book.She saw the next paragraph:\u3010Chu Qiuqiu smiled gracefully, holding the exquisite goblet in her hand and gently shaking the dark red wine in it: \u201cThere are many etiquette to remember in a banquet~ Sister, you don\u2019t know how to drink this, come, let me teach you\u2013\u201d\u3011Chu Yin thought for half a second, then tried to move the light pen to cross out the \u201cred\u201d of \u201cred wine\u201d then changed it to \u201ccooking\u201d.Chu Qiuqiu: \u201cYou have to shake it lightly first, and appreciate its color. Then, like this\u2026\u201dChu Yin calmly watched Chu Qiuqiu take a deep breath as her cup lightly pressed against her lips before she took a big sip .\u201cPuff!\u201d\u2014\u2014The\u00a0 liquid sprayed on the face of Mrs. Chu on the opposite side like brilliant fireworks.For a few seconds, the whole house fell silent. Only Xueji, who was in Chu Yin\u2019s head, made a chicken crow-like laugh as it sounded \u201cSystem binding successful~\u201d.The servant stumbled and ran over with a napkin. Mrs. Chu stood up in anger and embarrassment: \u201cQiu Qiu, what are you doing?!\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s glass of red wine was unexpectedly so bitter that she choked and spat out instinctively the moment she drank it.\u00a0 At this moment, she didn\u2019t have the elegant manner she just had as she said in a panic: \u201cMom, I didn\u2019t mean it!\u201dAmidst her mumblings, a clear and beautiful voice suddenly came in: \u201cOh, so it\u2019s like this.\u201dChu Qiuqiu suddenly looked up.Chu Yin, who had been silent, suddenly smiled. The exquisite facial features that were originally covered by her long hair were exposed, and a pair of peach eyes blinked slightly under her slender glimmering eyelashes.\u201cIt turns out that red wine is drunk like this? I learned it.\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was completely green.\u2026At three o\u2019clock in the middle of the quiet night, everyone had already fallen asleep, and Chu Yin had still been studying.After she was successfully bound with the system, the first task released was very basic: [Complete General Assignment].Chu Yin returned to the room from the kitchen, took a bath, and changed to her pajamas.Xueji\u2019s prompts were accompanied by a yawn: \u201cDing \u2013 political homework completed \u221a Task completion 70%. Host ~ don\u2019t you need to take a break?\u201dChu Yin rubbed her wrist, stretched her neck, and then opened the history exercise book.\u2014\u2014Now it\u2019s time to rest.After knowing that this system could really tamper with the plot, Chu Yin felt a long lost excitement \u2013 the ability to influence the events in the book, and as long as she completed the task, she herself could become the greater force and dominate her own life!For the rest of her life, Chu Yin never wanted to be Lu Zhen\u2019s first love.Tomorrow\u2013oh no, today was a turning point in her life, that is, the day Lu Zhen fell in love with her at first sight in the story.So she must get permission to change the script, change the plot of this day, even a small change could cause a long-term butterfly effect.Chu Yin was not a good student in her previous life. She was trapped by Lu Zhen at the age of 20, and was forced to supplement her knowledge for a long time. Later, she accompanied the young master Lu Zhen to take the GMAT exam. She was then trained by RC, DS, and SC, and she was taken by him to a foreign country for a year, auditing Ivy League courses, and this made her level of knowledge long surpassed the domestic high schools.She finished Math and English homework very quickly. She was a sophomore in senior high school so she still needed to review the textbooks for comprehensive subjects, and this took a little time.The room was quiet and only the sound of scratching against paper could be heard.When dawn broke, the room was lit up a little bit. Chu Yin made the last stroke, and the system in her brain finally made a beep.\u201cCompleted the general assignment task \u221a unlocked the script on the next page, and got permission to [change a word]. (Friendly reminder, as the difficulty of the learning task increases, the permission to modify will increase~)\u201dThe book and pen once again emerged from her brain. While the script loaded, Chu Yin was unexpectedly nervous.\u3010Location: Huiwen Private Middle School. Characters: Chu Yin, Lu Zhen, Chu Qiuqiu, and other classmates.\u3011\u3010The weather is not good on the first day of high school.\u3011\u3010A Bentley Mulsanne stopped at the school gate, and the girls passing by began to slow down as they adjusted their hairstyles. A few seconds later, a teenager in a white shirt got out of the car, and the crowd immediately began to make commotion.\u3011\u3010Lu Zhen lazily put his bag on his back and looked up. Light rain poured down the sky, and the black-haired boy looked cold and melancholy in the dense space.\u3011Most of the scenes were Lu Zhen\u2019s solo scenes, until a certain line\u2013\u3010Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes were indifferent until he suddenly saw the girl in the distance wearing a floral skirt while smiling at someone.\u3011Seeing this, Chu Yin\u2019s heart was stifled.This was her. She was just a 17 year old innocent and bright young girl in her previous life.To be honest, Chu Yin didn\u2019t know how the so-called love at first sight happened. She didn\u2019t even remember that she had met Lu Zhen on this day in her previous life. Did it become love after just one look?\u3010\u2026Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze paused for several seconds, then moved away.\u3011\u3010He thought: The skirt is so ugly.\u3011Chu Yin finished reading this paragraph: \u201c\u2026\u201dXueji began to chicken crow-laugh in her brain again: \u201cChuckchchchch\u2013\u201cChu Yin: \u201cShut up.\u201dThat\u2019s good, at this moment there were only a few big words in her heart.\u2014\u2014I will kill Lu Zhen.Chu Yin, with a cold face, scratched the word \u201crain\u201d so fast it was almost late for Xueji to stop it: \u201cOh, host\u2013 are you sure you will have no regrets, you can\u2019t change it after you write it! The word you chose seems\u2026\u201d It seems to be just a plain description of the climate!Chu Yin sneered: She didn\u2019t regret it.Let Lu Zhen regret it.Then she wrote \u201cknife\u201d on the crossed word.Xueji: \u201c\u2026\u201d You can really play.In the early morning, the weather was misty.The gate of Huiwen Private Middle School was bustling since today was the first day of school.The girls were yawning and complaining about the short summer vacation. Suddenly, there was a rustle in the crowd as a luxurious Bentley Mulsanne stopped at the school gate\u2014the whole school knew whose car it was.\u201cQuickly, quickly, Lu Zhen is here!\u201d\u201cAh, brother Zhen!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to school with him today.\u201dAfter a few seconds, the door opened and a long leg stepped out. The boy wore a simple white shirt, and his extravagance couldn\u2019t be stopped from radiating. On this cloudy day, his side face reflected cold and paleness, the line from his brow peak to the bridge of the nose was like a sculpture, and his jaw angle was perfect and precise. His eyes were long and sharp and there was a crimson mole on the tail of his eyes, adding a trace of desire to the cold feeling.Since he appeared, pink bubbles began to appear around him and pink petals seemed to be falling from the sky.Lu Zhen only raised his head indifferently\u2014the sky was dark, as if it was going to\u2026rain?\u201cBang\u201d\u2014Something indeed fell from the sky.Lu Zhen slowly lowered his head, and his gaze fell next to his shoes.He saw a bright knife lying there.\u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",

A knife fell down from the sky!\u201d\u201cHelp! Ah!!\u201dPink bubbles burst out as the scene fell into chaos.The knife that fell from the sky crackled, but fortunately didn\u2019t hit anyone. If anyone looked closely, the blade of the knife wasn\u2019t real. It just gleamed in cold light that made it look very scary.Lu Zhen frowned and looked around.There were no open windows on either side of the school building. Who threw them?In the distance of the campus, a slender figure looked at the direction of the school gate for a long time before she rectracted her eyes.Chu Yin lowered her head and the corner of her lips made a pleasant arc.Xueji: \u201cHost, you\u2019re so bad! But just to let you know, the system can\u2019t cause actual harm to the male lead~\u201dOf course Chu Yin knew that it wouldn\u2019t really kill Lu Zhen, but her purpose had still been achieved.With Lu Zhen\u2019s character, people who wanted to harm him would not easily escape from him.The original flow of the story was now destroyed, and everything would be different from now on.Standing on the side, Chu Qiuqiu followed Chu Yin\u2019s gaze and saw Lu Zhen in the crowd. She disdainfully thought, this bumpkin sister actually dared to think of Lu Zhen? She didn\u2019t even look at herself.Yesterday, there was a moment when she felt a sense of crisis that she was the low-quality version of Chu Yin\u2019s face, but a country bumpkin is a country bumpkin. Students in Huiwen Private Middle School wear an exclusive school uniform, but Chu Yin wore the most baggy and ugly school uniform, accompanied to that, she also wore a mask on her face, as if afraid she could be seen by people.On the contrary, for this first day of school, Chu Yin meticulously dressed up and even spent two hours putting make-up on her face. The two stood together, one was exquisite and outstanding, while the other was rustic and mediocre.Chu Qiuqiu really enjoyed this sharp contrast\u2013So what if Chu Yin was the real daughter of the Chu family? Obviously, she, herself, was more like the true lady of the family.Facing the inquiring eyes of the people in the school, she took Chu Yin\u2019s arm without disdain: \u201cSister, don\u2019t think about Lu Zhen. I will introduce you to ordinary boys~ Come, I will take you to your ordinary class.\u201dChu Yin pulled out her arm: \u201cThank you, but no need.\u201dLu Zhen was enough for her to be afraid of men.Class 5 was the best elite class in the general liberal class, with abundant talented teachers. Most of the students were also children of rich families. But because they wanted to take the local college entrance examination route, they chose the ordinary class.Although Mother Chu was separated from her own daughter for many years, she was interested in this class and chose it for Chu Yin.At this time, Class 5 was very lively.\u201cFuck, have you heard that Lu Zhen was almost killed at the school gate!\u201d\u201cImpossible, why would anyone dare to touch him?\u201d\u201cReally! look at the forum posts.\u201dBecause the incident centered on Lu Zhen, even if it only happened a few minutes ago, it quickly spread throughout the school.Many rich second-generation students in class 5 were very familiar with the international class, and they had a lively chat in class.It wasn\u2019t until a figure walked in that the noisy classroom suddenly became quiet.\u2014\u2014Chu Qiuqiu? What was she doing in class 5.Fu Mingxuan, who was sitting in the center of the classroom, was still worried about Lu Zhen. As soon as she saw her, she immediately smiled in a state of preparation: \u201cHello darling1~\u201cChu Yin entered the classroom behind Chu Qiuqiu and was speechless for a second when she saw Fu Mingxuan. This person was Lu Zhen\u2019s number one admirer. She had a deep hostility against Chu Yin in her previous life while chasing Lu Zhen for a long time.But at this time, Fu Mingxuan\u2019s main opponent was Chu Qiuqiu. Both of them came from wealthy families. They were both beautiful and good at learning. They were also famous for being plastic, treating each other with kindness in public, but destroying each other in secret. They communicated better than anyone else in English.Chu Qiuqiu smiled gracefully: \u201cMorning babe~\u201dFu Mingxuan\u2019s eyes turned and saw Chu Yin behind her, frowning with discomfort: \u201cOMG, who\u2019s she? Why do you stand with her?\u201cChu Qiuqiu immediately gave a gentle and prepared smile: \u201cThis is my sister Chu Yin. She just came from the countryside, and doesn\u2019t understand English. Let\u2019s speak Chinese.\u201dAfter she said this, the whole class 5 looked at Chu Yin\u2019s expression and felt it was strange\u2014then why could this ugly and country bumpkin enter their elite class? Wearing that kind of school uniform could make people blind. She must also look scary since she covered her face with a mask!As the class flower, Fu Mingxuan felt even more disdainful, and she directly called Chu Yin, who was looking for an empty seat, \u201cHey\u2014classmate over there, why don\u2019t you go to Class 7 which suits you better?\u201dAll the people around her laughed. Class 7 was a late-entry class. Students in that class were not rich and had poor grades. This was the lowest place in Huiwen Private Middle School.Chu Qiuqiu put on an unbearable expression: \u201cMingxuan, how could you say this? she is also my sister.\u201dFu Mingxuan raised her eyebrows: \u201cIs it a problem if I tell her to go somewhere?\u201dAll the people in Class 5 looked at Chu Yin and wanted to see how the bumpkin from this village would react. But, Chu Yin was very calm. She chose the seat by the window and put her school bag away. Then she looked up at the two of them.Chu Qiuqiu was more clever compared to Fu Mingxuan. It was Chu Qiuqiu who slyly wanted to humiliate her. Although Chu Yin didn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s opinions at all, she was certainly not patient.Her face was hidden under the mask, revealing only a pair of clear eyes. She replied with no hesitation, \u201cYes. Who do you think should go back, sister?\u201dChu Qiuqiu was stupefied for a second before her face turned pale.\u2014\u2014Chu Yin was reminding her, the fake daughter, to return to where she belonged.The place that originally belonged to her\u2026Chu Qiuqiu still had memories from before she was adopted at the age of 7, the dilapidated home, the poor faces of her biological parents\u2026No, she didn\u2019t belong there, and she would never let others know where she came from!Fu Mingxuan didn\u2019t understand, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dChu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t dare to continue this topic anymore, and quickly said: \u201cMother specially contacted the school. Mingxuan, stop making trouble. My sister won\u2019t disturb you.\u201dFu Mingxuan rolled her eyes unhappily.Chu Yin had already sat in her seat and opened the math textbook.\u201cDing\u2013sending today\u2019s learning task~ Complete the final question after class. The difficulty index is three stars. After completion, you can get the [change word] permission.\u201dWord change? Chu Yin immediately grasped the point.It seemed an increase in power reflected in the degree of alteration. If she completed a more difficult task, she could probably change sentences, paragraphs, and even\u2026Chu Yin was excited again. She had never found learning so exciting. She was finally passionate about something.After the class started, the head teacher mentioned to everyone that Chu Yin had transferred to this class. Chu Yin introduced herself calmly and briefly, and only a few claps followed.Chu Yin didn\u2019t care whether she had a group or not, she didn\u2019t even care when the table next to her was empty. In the morning, she sat in her seat, studying. The teacher watched her sitting quietly, not bothering to care about this new student.She reviewed the high school mathematics textbooks and sorted out her knowledge structure, and found that the knowledge she accumulated in her previous life could basically cover this grade\u2019s pointers, and she was immediately relieved.On the other hand, Fu Mingxuan was inexplicably concerned about this transfer student. In the morning, she looked back at Chu Yin several times and found that this person could only study like a nerd, and her inexplicable hostility was replaced by contempt.\u2013Funny. What kind of good student a country bumpkin be? Could she understand their textbooks?When lunch break came, no one in the class came to talk to Chu Yin, and they just went in twos and threes to the cafeteria.Obviously, Chu Qiuqiu, who was asked by Mother Chu to guide Chu Yin, had completely \u201cforgotten\u201d that her sister probably didn\u2019t know where the cafeteria was.Chu Yin calmly finished her notes and walked to the cafeteria with her campus card.The jasmine planted in the school this year was as brilliant as the painting. This time she didn\u2019t have the dog man Lu Zhen in her life, and even the flowers were more fragrant than in the past life.Returning to the classroom in the afternoon, Chu Yin was in a good mood. Because it had been peaceful the whole morning, she took off the mask with confidence and started to do the final task assigned by the system.Groups of people returned to the classroom, still surrounding Fu Mingxuan, and a boy then walked with her and said something.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he\u2019s not hurt.\u201d\u201cReally! That\u2019s good. I was scared to death.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Linzi, you weren\u2019t here this morning. Do you know you have a new deskmate?\u201dWhen this was mentioned, everyone laughed.Song Zhaolin touched his head: \u201cHuh?\u201dThe man on the side patted him on the shoulder: \u201cYou are lucky, hahaha!\u201dSong Zhaolin hugged his bag and returned to his seat. Sure enough, he saw a girl with slender shoulders, wearing an old school uniform. She was writing a question with her head down, her face blocked by her long black hair.Although Song Zhaolin wanted to talk, it wouldn\u2019t be good to interrupt while she was studying, so he had to sit down and accept reality. The surreptitious onlookers withdrew their gazes suddenly and chatted together.Chu Yin got stuck once she reached the final question. She moved and slightly raised her head. Song Zhaolin, who was next to her, took the opportunity and patted her: \u201cHey, new deskmate, you\u2013\u201dChu Yin turned her face.Song Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dIt\u2019s true. He\u2019s lucky.The girl had shiny black hair, her palm-sized face was white and tender, her peach eyes were as beautiful as the spring water, and her lips were rosy. She took a casual look and there was the natural charm of a young girl. Song Zhaolin\u2019s face instantly blushed.Chu Yin frowned slightly: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s okay,\u201d Song Zhaolin\u2019s voice was getting lower and lower, scared that he would startle her, \u201cLet me\u2026introduce myself. I\u2019m your new deskmate, Song Zhaolin.\u201d\u201cOh, hello.\u201d Chu Yin vaguely felt that this name was a bit familiar, but she couldn\u2019t remember this person.In order not to attract attention, Chu Yin lowered her head and put on the mask again.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Song Zhaolin was still in shock by her beauty. He was dumbfounded.Chu Yin whispered: \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen me.\u201dSong Zhaolin was taken aback: \u201cHuh?\u201dChu Yin raised her bright eyes: \u201cOkay?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cOkay!!!\u201dChu Yin was relieved. She then went back and continued to solve the problem. She was still looking forward to getting the permission to change words. After all, Lu Zhen was still in this school. There would still be accidents in the future.In the classroom, the conversation between her sister and Fu Mingxuan continued: \u201cHey, I\u2019m so angry. It took me a long time to make this gift, and originally wanted to give it to him today. Who knew that something like this would happen.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so distressing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Lu Zhen will come to school. I will give it to him next time.\u201dChu Yin turned her pen, changing the formula in her mind. This final question was indeed a bit difficult, but as long as she was given a little more time\u2026But at this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came from the back door of the classroom.\u2014\u2014\u201dSong Zhaolin, come out.\u201dThe boy\u2019s voice was cold, like a shard of ice flakes. She was startled\u2026it was just as she remembered.Chu Yin\u2019s pupils suddenly shrunk, and she almost jumped up from her chair, but was able to hold back.Under the stimulation of this voice, Chu Yin finally remembered who Song Zhaolin was\u2013he was one of Lu Zhen\u2019s friends in Huiwen Private Middle School!At this time, Xueji\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cHost, relax~ The power of the male lead is everywhere, and the plot can be corrected anytime and anywhere.\u201dCorrect the plot\u2026? !Chu Yin couldn\u2019t predict events that involved Lu Zhen again, but it must not be what she hoped to happen.Song Zhaolin, who was next to her, responded to Lu Zhen\u2019s call and was about to get up.Right there and then, Chu Yin made the decision immediately. She held the pen and quickly checked the final step. Her brain was running at high speed to figure out the numbers when she finally heard the beep of the system.\u201cFinale task is complete \u221a Unlocked the script on the next page and got permission to [change a word].\u201dChu Yin quickly browsed the downloaded script\u2013\u3010Lu Zhen stood at the back door of Class 5 and looked at Song Zhaolin.Fu Mingxuan was very surprised to see him. She stood up shyly while being pushed by Chu Qiuqiu. She walked up to Lu Zhen and handed the gift she made by herself.Fu Mingxuan: \u201cLu Zhen, I made this by myself. I want to give it to you during the holiday\u2026\u201d\u3011At this time, Class 5 began to get excited because of the appearance of Lu Zhen. Song Zhaolin had already left his seat, and Chu Yin instantly lost her cover. She sensed the familiar and oppressive gaze was slowly falling on her.Chu Yin immediately moved the light pen and crossed out the word [gift] . She needed something exciting to drag Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze away from her.Xueji watched the play: \u201cOh? How do you plan to change it, host?\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t hesitate for half a second and changed the word to [bomb] .Xueji: \u201c\u2026\u2026[thumbs up]\u201dAt this time, Fu Mingxuan stood in front of Lu Zhen, blocking his vision of the classroom.\u201cLu Zhen, I did this myself\u2026\u201dShe lowered her head shyly, and stretched out her hands towards Lu Zhen with her eyes closed.Suddenly, the classroom fell silent.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, his dark pupils staring at the round, sparkling thing in her hand.It took a few seconds before he calmly said, \u201cIt was you who threw the knife this morning?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A bomb!\u201d\u201cHelp! Ah!!\u201dClass 5 was in chaos. Some students got under the table.Fu Mingxuan was holding the bomb as she cried.When Chu Yin reached the corner outside the classroom, she heard Fu Mingxuan bursting into tears: \u201cIt\u2019s not me! I, I made you chocolate! How did this happen!\u201dSong Zhaolin, who had just walked over, was also shocked. \u201cFuck, this, this a\u2026bomb?!\u201dLu Zhen frowned and looked at it carefully: \u201cFake.\u201dSure enough, after the fuse of the bomb burned, there was a sound of a \u2018click\u2019, like it was a prank. Fu Mingxuan almost collapsed to the ground.Song Zhaolin\u2019s face was dull. The knife in the morning was also fake, but they were all made very realistic, enough to not be considered a bluff at first glance.Because he was Lu Zhen, if something happened to him in school, the school principal had to make amends to the Lu family, and it was dangerous to provoke Lu Zhen\u2014who was the person who dared to provoke him repeatedly?Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes also dimmed, but this time, he didn\u2019t delve into this issue.He turned his gaze slightly, looked behind Song Zhaolin, and suddenly asked, \u201cWho\u2019s sitting next to you?\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2013\u201d Song Zhaolin thought of his beautiful table mate, and subconsciously wanted to rainbow fart1. But suddenly remembered what his table mate said to him, so he held back: \u201c\u2014my new classmate.\u201dLooking behind him, he saw that the seat was empty.Song Zhaolin touched his head: Where is his deskmate? ? She was just there!\u2026Chu Yin climbed to the school building\u2019s rooftop.The male lead was almost killed twice in a row on the first day of school, so he went home early.Chu Yin was lying on the edge of the roof, boredly watching Song Zhaolin sending Lu Zhen to his Bentley.At this year, Lu Zhen still didn\u2019t have the violent and terrifying aura he later had. The boy was tall and lean, with clean black hair pressed against his neck, his complexion was cold and pale, and his eyes looked cool and modest.At first glance, it was unpredictable that he would grow into such a crazy paranoid freak in the future.Chu Yin poked the system: \u201cChicken, can I just change my school in the script?\u201dThe male lead\u2019s halo was really terrifying. It\u2019s unsure when this dog man would suddenly appear, and she couldn\u2019t really kill him.Xueji: \u201cI\u2019m not a chicken!! And no, [ Transferred to Huiwen Private Middle School ] is written on the cover page, which is a non-modified part~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d She would think of other ways later.She couldn\u2019t take off this mask yet. In fact, the love at first sight isn\u2019t exactly what it is. As long as Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t see her, he wouldn\u2019t have any of those thoughts.In addition, she needed to study harder, not only to strangle Lu Zhen in the script, but also for her bright and beautiful future.Chu Yin pulled up the mask and turned to leave the rooftop.In the distance, before getting on the car, Lu Zhen suddenly turned halfway and glanced at the rooftop.There was no one there.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Brother Zhen?\u201d\u201cNothing.\u201dChu Yin returned to the classroom and found that there was no one in the classroom. She took out her mobile phone and checked the class schedule, only to know that this math class was a public class and she needed to go to the lecture hall.There were a total of four classes including the international class. Fortunately, Lu Zhen went home, otherwise she would have to ask for leave and skip class.Grabbing the textbook, workbook and pencil case, Chu Yin found the lecture hall. The classroom was already half full, and Chu Yin quietly found a place in the back row to sit down, preparing to do her own task quietly.As the melodious class bell rang, the back door of the classroom was suddenly pushed open, and Chu Qiuqiu, who was fashionably late, stepped inside. She wore a carefully selected autumn skirt, and her delicate face looked even prettier with her make-up. All the eyes of students cast a glance at her for a while.One girl in international class, who took the best seat in front row, greeted her: \u201cQiuqiu sit here~\u201dChu Qiuqiu smiled softly in the eyes of everyone and shook her head. She glanced around and saw a covered Chu Yin in the corner. Chu Yin laughed softer. She knew that Chu Yin from the countryside would probably hide in a corner and dared not speak out in front of these many people.Chu Qiuqiu walked straight over, put her book next to Chu Yin, and said briskly, \u201cWhy won\u2019t my sister sit in front? I\u2019ll sit with you. If there\u2019s something you don\u2019t understand in class, just ask me~\u201dChu Yin glanced at her noncommittally.\u201cWow, Chu Qiuqiu is a kindhearted person!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the daughter the Chu family picked up from the village? She is so low.\u201d\u201cSure enough, Chu Qiuqiu is truly the daughter of the Chu family.\u201dWhile Chu Qiuqiu listened to these whispers and bathed in the sight of everyone, a strong sense of superiority surged into her heart. As she raised her hand to gracefully curl her hair, she thought to herself, Chu Yin must be on pins and needles in other people\u2019s eyes now.But in fact, Chu Yin had long been accustomed to other people\u2019s attention.In her last life, she became a school flower after she transferred to Huiwen. At that time, she received much more ardent eyes than now. Later, she was entangled by Lu Zhen and her every move was watched at school. Re-living this time again, Chu Yin was stronger and calmer than before. Now, even if people stared at her, she could read and study calmly.At this moment, Chu Yin was talking to Xueji in her head.\u201cSo I can only get permission to change the script twice a day?\u201d Chu Yin\u2019s tone was disappointed after learning about this rule.\u201cYes, at the moment~ The host\u2019s authority to change has been exhausted! But the host can\u2019t relax because of this. It takes a long time to complete higher-level learning tasks~\u201dOf course, Chu Yin understood this truth. According to the current system model, tasks such as exam rankings would probably be released later. Although her education was already at the university level, she still had to review her knowledge in high school. Although Huiwen\u2019s ranking was not as good as that of the No. 1 middle school in the country, there were also some good students. If she wants to be first in the exam, she must work hard.Thinking of this, Chu Yin took out the exercises without any distractions.On the other side of the classroom, Fu Mingxuan sat glumly in her seat and didn\u2019t want to listen. She made a fool of herself in front of Lu Zhen today. It was like the sky fell. If she catches the person who hurt her, she must humiliate her/him.Several classmates were worried and didn\u2019t know how to comfort her. Suddenly they saw Chu Yin in the back row and sneered : \u201cYuxuan, look, that country bumpkin in our class is studying hard!\u201dFu Mingxuan glanced and mocked. \u201cI think she\u2019s been pretending to be a good student since this morning.\u201dWhen the class teacher introduced her, she said that she might not be able to keep up, and asked the classmates to help her.A girl suddenly remembered something: \u201cHey, later, teacher Zhao will definitely ask someone to do the questions. Do you think she will cry if she\u2019s called?\u201dSeveral people laughed at the idea that Chu Yin would be embarrassed to be exposed as a fake scholar. With this, Fu Mingxuan\u2019s expression also improved significantlyChu Yin finished the rest of exercises except for the last question. She corrected two small mistakes according to the correct answer, and then turned back to the last question. She had already done it, but accumulating experience in wrong questions is a very effective way of learning.Chu Qiuqiu, on one side, glanced at her, and almost laughed when she saw her doing the last question.She was afraid that this sister she brought back was too good, so she asked about her grades and learned that Chu Yin couldn\u2019t pass a hundred in that trash town middle school. She estimated that she couldn\u2019t even compare to class 7.Chu Qiuqiu laughed in her heart: Mediocre students will always be mediocre students. She had no awareness of the difficulty of this school.In the last few minutes left in this class, the math teacher really reached the last question. \u201cLet\u2019s take a look at the last parametric equation! Does anyone want to try it out?\u201dNo one answered since this question was extremely difficult. No one wanted to make a fool of themselves in front of the many students.The math teacher waited for a while: \u201cIf not, I will call someone.\u201dAmong these classes, the International Class and Class 5 were all considered top-notch students, and the math teacher was quite confident in them.Fu Mingxuan and a few members of Class 5 were praying it would be Chu Yin. At this moment, a voice sounded: \u201cTeacher, I would like to try!\u201dChu Qiuqiu smiled and raised her hand. The math teacher knew this student, who placed in the top ten of the whole grade, and immediately waved happily: \u201cCome, do it on the blackboard.\u201dFu Mingxuan was very upset. She knew that Chu Qiuqiu would not miss this opportunity to stand out in public!It was a pity that Chu Qiuqiu failed to make the limelight. She answered the first question smoothly, but got stuck at the second question. Chu Yin just finished analyzing the wrong question. When she glanced up, she found that Chu Qiuqiu was stuck several steps earlier than her.Fu Mingxuan felt proud and anxious at the same time. She was proud because Chu Qiuqiu couldn\u2019t do it, and anxious because she couldn\u2019t think of a solution to the math problem, otherwise she could suppress Chu Qiuqiu.The math teacher said cheerfully: \u201cCan\u2019t answer it? I\u2019ll call another one.\u201dHis gaze swept along the list: \u201c\u2014\u2014Classmate Chu Yin! Come and try.\u201dIn that moment, the entire students in the classroom looked behind.Fu Mingxuan and her friends were laughing crazy: \u201cFuck, teacher Zhao hit the spot ! He won the prize directly!\u201dChu Yin was suddenly called, and subconsciously glanced to the right.The one sitting on the right happened to be her class 5 classmate. The student immediately turned his head to the side and pretended not to see.\u201cPffttt!\u201d\u201cDid you see it hahaha! She panicked, she panicked!\u201dChu Yin was speechless for a moment. In fact, she wanted to ask if it was necessary to go to the board to answer the question?After all, she didn\u2019t need to check the answer in her notes, the answer was already in her mind.Standing on the podium, Chu Qiuqiu naturally saw Chu Yin\u2019s reaction. Her embarrassment of not being able to solve the problem was immediately relieved, and she gently said, \u201cTeacher, my sister, she won\u2019t\u2026\u201dChu Yin was too lazy to listen to her. She simply sat down and answered directly:\u201cVerify the common points of l1, l2 and circle C1 respectively, and we can get k=4/3. The equation to be solved is y=4/3|x|+2.\u201dChu Qiuqiu was stunned, and Fu Mingxuan also hesitated.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me she fabricated this\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe she made it all up.\u201dIn the next second, the math teacher said with satisfaction: \u201cYes! The answer is correct!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 \u2013 Lu Zhen left againChu Yin got the correct answer?!Song Zhaolin slipped back to class after sending Lu Zhen off. When he heard that Chu Yin was called, he worried about his table mate for a second. After hearing Chu Yin\u2019s clear and smooth answer, he was suddenly shocked, \u201cNew classmate is pretty good!\u201dFu Mingxuan sat not far from Song Zhaolin and was suddenly very upset after hearing her answer.How could Chu Yin be able to answer?Fu Mingxuan scored the highest score in the class at the end of last semester in mathematics, which was higher than Chu Qiuqiu. She couldn\u2019t think of a solution to this problem, how could this new student think of it?Chu Qiuqiu on the stage was also stunned-Her face was stiff and hot as she remembered what she said to Chu Yin before class,\u00a0\u201cYou can ask me if you have any questions.\u201dYet, Chu Yin correctly answered the questions she couldn\u2019t solve.The math teacher complimented Chu Yin and asked Chu Qiuqiu to return to her seat.She restrained her ugly expression and instead showed her elegance. When she went back to her seat, only to see that Chu Yin was playing with her phone, her mind suddenly moved.Two minutes before class was about to finish, Chu Yin took out her phone to check the time while she leisurely played for a while. She then got up and left when the bell rang.Fu Mingxuan came over and asked Chu Qiuqiu: \u201cShe did the question just now?\u201dChu Qiuqiu answered, her voice not too loud or quiet, but enough for everyone in class 5 to hear, \u201cYou can find the answers online.\u201dFu Mingxuan breathed a sigh of relief and smiled sarcastically: \u201cOf course, I know.\u201dThe little sisters behind her came together to complain: \u201cWhy did she bother to pretend?\u201d\u201cShe isn\u2019t pretty and doesn\u2019t have good manners, maybe she did it to look good in front of others. Let her pretend\u2026her true results will show in the exam!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right when that moment comes, Ming Xuan will show her.\u201dAfter listening to their conversation, Song Zhaolin showed a face of confusion.Was Chu Yin not good enough?What\u2019s more, there were answers on the internet? Why couldn\u2019t he find it??Chu Qiuqiu did not respond to Song Zhaolin\u2019s doubts. She felt a little uneasy in her heart. She hurriedly walked to a place with no people, looked around, and then dialed an unknown number.The phone was quickly connected. Chu Qiuqiu lowered her voice, \u201cFind her transcript records and send it to me. I will treat you nicely after it\u2019s done.\u201dThe voice on the other side had a thick accent, and its tone was flattering: \u201cNo problem, Miss Chu. Don\u2019t worry!\u201dWhen Chu Yin went to school the next day, she felt that the eyes of class 5 looked strangely at her.It was just that no one bothered to notice her before, but today there were people in the class looking at her with mocking eyes as if they knew everything, pointing out her wrongdoings.Chu Yin lived her second life again. She would not be affected by this naive behavior at all. Interpersonal relationships are so boring, how can it be more fun than learning?She tapped on the system: \u201cWhat about today\u2019s task?\u201dXueji happily said: \u201cDing\u2013 according to system detection, today\u2019s learning task is~ Please proficiently recite \u201cFarewell Cambridge\u00a01\u201c, \u201cLanting Preface\u00a02\u201c, \u201cSong of the Red Cliff\u00a03\u201c,\u00a0 and \u201cTravel to Bao Chan Mountain\u00a04\u201cChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe retracted the sentence of \u2018learning is fun\u2019.\u201c~You can get permission to [Change Words] after you finish it~\u201d Xueji added cheerfully.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe could do any exercise questions, as long as the system would not make her recite these poems. It was always her weakness and pain to memorize.She could memorize any texts from the three subjects\u2013history, geography, and politics, but classical Chinese is on a whole new level.However, to keep the reward, Chu Yin has to memorize them.After a class break, she just barely finished memorizing the simplest poem out of the five listed \u201cFarewell Cambridge\u201dChu Yin was very worried about her progress. She wasn\u2019t productive today at all.Song Zhaolin, who was sitting next to her, tried to talk to her several times but didn\u2019t find a chance.Fu Mingxuan and the others came back after buying milk tea. They were disappointed because they didn\u2019t meet Lu Zhen by chance, but when they saw Chu Yin, they immediately reaped the source of happiness.\u201cLook at her working hard. It\u2019s not easy to maintain the personality of a good and clever student. It\u2019s a pity that she still has to dress up like a scholar student!\u201d\u201cSenior Chu and Senior Gu are going back to China today. Don\u2019t the Chu family have a celebration banquet? Do you think this country bumpkin will attend?\u201d\u201cHow will she participate? Is it possible for her to wear a beautiful gown?\u201d\u201cHahaha it is possible\u2013\u201cFu Mingxuan raised her eyebrows triumphantly: \u201cChu Qiuqiu invited me. I will send you some photos of her then.\u201d\u201cWow! I am envious.\u201d\u201cXuan Xuan, you can meet the two handsome seniors.\u201dAlthough their second year of high school is more interested in Lu Zhen, Gu Qiuze in high school is the former school grass, Chu Shi is also a famous handsome guy in the school, usually, ordinary class people can easily reach. How can you not be envious?Although Lu Zen is more popular than the two seniors, Gu Qiuze is the former school grass and Chu Shi is known to be one of the handsome boys in the school.Ordinary people in ordinary classes can\u2019t easily contact them. How can they not envy Fu Mingxian?Chu Yin didn\u2019t know what they were arranging in private, as she finally finished memorizing \u201cSong of the Red Cliff\u201d smoothly before school.\u201cDing-three poems completed \u221a 60% of task completion. Host, come on~\u201dAt the end of the last class, Chu Yin packed up her homework and left neatly with her backpack.Song Zhaolin tried to open his mouth, but couldn\u2019t even call her. His expression was extremely depressed.People in Class 5 saw it and sympathized: \u201cHow about you, Linzi? Is it uncomfortable to sit with her?\u201dSong Zhaolin nodded: \u201cUncomfortable.\u201dThe beauty is too sassy and he couldn\u2019t even speak to her!!!Chu Yin sat in the car arranged by the Chu family. She read the textbooks along the way.The driver looked at the daughter, who was just picked up from the countryside, from the rearview mirror, and found that she was completely different from the other lady.She doesn\u2019t talk much. She is simple but very hardworking. After taking off her mask, her beautiful face was revealed, unlike Miss Chu Qiuqiu who could not go out without makeup.No one would dislike such a good kid. The driver deliberately drove the car smoothly and opened the door for Chu Yin when they arrived.When Chu Yin arrived and saw that the whole villa was decorated, she remembered that today was her brother\u2019s celebration banquet.Brother\u2026After returning to the Chu family in her previous life, Chu Yin always thought that her brother liked Chu Qiuqiu more than her. But after the Chu family went bankrupt, their parents were busy saving their careers, Chu Qiuqiu was busy hooking up with other wealthy sons to maintain her wealthy life, but only her elder brother cared about her being imprisoned by Lu Zhen.For several years, her elder brother had been trying hard for Gu family to save her, but Lu Zhen quickly settled down as the head of the Lu family, and his extreme desire to control her was too intense.Before her death in her previous life, her brother and Gu Qiuze returned to China to find Chu Yin, but it was a pity that Chu Yin had died before they could even rescue her\u2026Thinking of the last scene of the previous life\u2026Chu Yin felt another turbulent killing intent rising from her gut.Even after the system told her that she died, when she thought of her death in Lu Zhen\u2019s bed, she wanted to kill that dog man\u2026!But even though she wanted to see her brother, Chu Yin didn\u2019t plan to attend the banquet. In her previous life, she accompanied Lu Zhen to participate too many times and had seen all kinds of big shots and big scenes.Although she had the ability and manners to attend such a high-level banquet, she was just really tired of such hypocritical social occasions.At this time, the Chu parents would not care about her, so Chu Yin simply went upstairs to her room and went on to study.At night, there was a little noise downstairs. The guests arrived at Chu\u2019s house with gifts, both the Chu father and Chu mother were busy socializing. Chu Qiuqiu dressed up beautifully, like a butterfly, circling among her little friends.\u201cQiuqiu, where is your sister?\u201d One of her friends asked maliciously.Chu Qiuqiu glanced at the closed door upstairs and smiled softly: \u201cMy sister is not suitable for such an occasion.\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cIf she comes, she will be embarrassed.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so envious of Qiu Qiu. Your brother is handsome and he loves you dearly. You also can be close to Senior Gu Qiuze.\u201dChu Qiuqiu raised her eyebrows, and with a reserved smile, she said, \u201cWait for me to introduce brother and Senior Gu to you.\u201d\u201cReally!\u201d\u201cQiuqiu, you are so good!\u201dAfter the clock ticked at 8 pm, the two protagonists finally appeared on the stage and greeted everyone. There were claps and applauses.As the eldest sons of the two families, Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze were accustomed to such scenes. They were dragged by the two parents to entertain each other.After finally being polite, Chu Shi took a glass of wine and looked around.Chu Mother was very proud and satisfied with her son, as she smiled and said: \u201cLater on when the Song family arrives, you can greet them.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chu Shi nodded as he looked around the room full of people gathering.Suddenly he asked, \u201cXiao Yin has come back?\u201dChu Mother nodded: \u201cShe is back. Remember to visit your sister later. She is not familiar with us yet.\u201dChu Shi suddenly interrupted her: \u201cMom, you held a celebration banquet since I won a prize. But when Xiao Yin finally came home, why wasn\u2019t there any welcome banquet for her?\u201dChu Mother was startled.Chu Shi didn\u2019t say anything and walked towards his friend.Gu Qiuze touched his glasses and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go see her after?\u201dChu Shi took a deep breath.On the plane back from the United States, he had a dream.In his dream, he saw that in a few years, their family would go bankrupt. Chu Qiuqiu, who had been raised in the family for ten years, turned directly to join other high-profile families, while his sister was imprisoned by that bastard Lu Zhen.In the dream, he didn\u2019t see his sister even in her last moments, so he woke up with grief. Then, his thoughts were all about seeing his sister once he came back.Chu Shi drank the wine in one breath and put the empty glass on the servant\u2019s tray: \u201cGo now.\u201dHe walked two steps forwards before turning around to look at Gu Qiuze: \u201cYou too.\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c???\u201dIf the dream was true, then his good friend, Gu Qiuze, is interested in his sister.In this life, he must hurry up and work hard to bring Gu Qiuze and Chu Yin together before Lu Zhen snatches his sister back.The Gu family is the only family that can compete with the Lu family. If the love match was successful, his younger sister would no longer fall into Lu Zhen\u2019s hands!At this moment, Chu Qiuqiu brought her friends over and embraced Chu Shi affectionately in front of them: \u201cBrother, my friends all want to know you and Brother Qiuze~\u201dThe girls were immediately embarrassed as they shyly tucked their hair away.Chu Shi thought of her arrogance in his dream, and showed a flat expression: \u201cWhere is Xiao Yin?\u201dChu Qiuqiu was stunned.The girls behind her were also stunned. Doesn\u2019t Senior Chu Shi only love Chu Qiuqiu?Why did he want to meet that country bumpkin the first time he arrived home?? And, how could he address her so intimately?Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was a bit pale: \u201cYes, she\u2019s upstairs.\u201dChu Shi nodded and went upstairs with Gu Qiuze.When the door of the room was knocked, Chu Yin had just finished memorizing \u201cTravel to Bao Chan Mountains\u201d.She was drinking water when the system notified,\u201cDing\u2013Recitation task completed \u221a Unlock the script on the next page and get permission to [change a word]! The host has worked hard~\u201dBefore Chu Yin had time to read the script on the next page, she wiped her lips and opened the door.Seeing Chu Shi standing outside the door, she was a little surprised, and whispered: \u201cBrother?\u201dChu Shi didn\u2019t know why, but she was a little excited when she saw her brother.He coughed twice and asked, \u201cDo you still recognize me?\u201dChu Yin nodded.Chu Shi raised his hand and gently touched her head: \u201cCome out, your brother will take you to eat and will introduce you to a new friend.\u201dChu Yin felt it was a little strange. In her previous life, it took a while before her brother got close to her. But, he might have come here because she didn\u2019t attend the banquet, whereas, in her last life, she did.She was very happy to see her brother and nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dOnly when she left the room, Chu Yin suddenly was confused when she saw the \u2018new friend\u2019 that Chu Shi mentioned.Gu Qiuze leaned against the railing on the second floor, his eyes lit up when she came out and then smiled friendly.Gu Qiuze\u2019s facial features are bright and handsome, and his smile is like the mint-scented wind. It\u2019s to win the favor of girls with a boy like this. Although Chu Yin didn\u2019t like him in her previous life, she didn\u2019t dislike Gu Qiuze either.But\u2026Lu Zhen hated him very much.The only son of the Lu family and the eldest son of the Gu family were compared by the families since childhood. Lu Zhen didn\u2019t hide his hate against Gu Qiuze.This disgust later also fermented Lu Zhen\u2019s morbid possessiveness towards Chu Yin, that it left a heavy shadow on her.As long as she had sporadic contact with Gu Qiuze, Lu Zhen would appear, causing her to suffer.Fortunately, Lu Zhen would never come to this occasion that celebrated Gu Qiuze\u2019s winning.Chu Shi led Chu Yin over and introduced enthusiastically: \u201cThis is Gu Qiuze, one year older than you, and a classmate of your brother. He has good looks, good character, and also the eldest son at his family\u2026\u201dGu Qiuze interrupted him: \u201cShut up.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned to Chu Yin and smiled: \u201cHello, I\u2019m Gu Qiuze.\u201dChu Yin pursed her lips and told herself that everything was different.Lu Zhen hadn\u2019t seen her yet.\u201cHello, I\u2026\u2026\u201dJust as she said three words, the door downstairs was suddenly pushed open, and there was a clear \u2018creak\u2019 sound.\u2014At that instant moment, Chu Yin had a bad premonition in her heart.Then, she heard someone exclaim: \u201cIsn\u2019t that Young Master Lu?!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dDamn you, Lu Zhen.Xueji said: \u201cHost, you can\u2019t ignore the power of the male lead~\u201dChu Yin: \u201cLoad the script, hurry up.\u201dThe glowing pages of the book spread out, and Chu Yin suddenly saw the script\u3010Lu Zhen arrived.\u3011With these four characters, she suddenly regretted that she didn\u2019t finish reading the script before opening the door to her brother.Even more frightening was that there was another sentence in the script:\u3010The young man walked into the entrance, holding a gift box. His indifferent gaze looked around and saw Gu Qiuze standing by the balcony on the second floor, and next to him was\u2026\u3011Chu Yin: \u201c!!!!\u201dXueji said: \u201cHost, the male lead is about to see you~\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t hesitate, and immediately moved the tip of the light pen to the sentence \u3010Lu Zhen arrived.\u3011.How to change?\u2014\u2014Lu Zhen died?\u2014\u2014Lu Zhen ceased to exist?\u2014\u2014Lu Zhen\u2026Lu Zhen limped?Xueji: \u201c\u2026You can\u2019t do that, host.\u201dThe moment Lu Zhen\u2019s figure walked the entrance door, Chu Yin was suddenly blessed with an idea, and crossed out the word \u201carrived\u201d.Chu Yin changed \u201carrived\u201d to \u201cleft\u201d\u3010Lu Zhen\u00a0arrived\u00a0left.\u3011Xueji: \u201c\u2026[clapped hands] amazing!\u201dEveryone greeted him enthusiastically downstairs: \u201cYoung Master Lu!\u2014\u2014\u201dThen they saw Lu Zhen walk-in indifferently, put down the gift box, and then walked away.The door creaked and closed again, only the autumn wind swept the hall.The people who were swept away: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThis Young Master Lu\u2026is quite cold?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 \u2013 Think of it as a dreamThe boy stood quietly for a while in the evening breeze of September.His black hair was blown by the wind, exposing his white forehead. His eyes were very pale. There was a brown-red tear mole under the dense tail of his eyes, softening the slightly sharp arc of his eyes. He has delicate and profound features. He stood in silence, wearing a pure black silk shirt, just like a carefully made canvas.However, at the moment, there was a little confusion on the face of the picturesque-man.Lu Zhen felt very strange.He didn\u2019t know why he came or why he left.Because Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze returned home, the Chu family held a banquet for them. He originally threw away the invitation letter. Lu Zhen was not interested even when his grandfather said that the Chu family had brought back a daughter of his age.But he came.On the second floor of the Chu family, beside the carved fence and behind Gu Qiuze, was a girl.She showed a small part of her face under the lamp. Lu Zhen only saw that she was very pale and the radian of her cheek was soft. Her black hair fell obediently, looking like the kind of person he was used to. But there seemed to be an inexplicable attraction that made Lu Zhen look at her at first sight.After a while of staying under the cold wind, Lu Zhen raised his hand and rubbed his brows.A knife that fell from the sky\u2026Receiving a bomb\u2026There were a lot of strange things recently.He needed to calm down for a few days.\u2026\u2026The hall of the Chu\u2019s villa was silent for a long time after Lu Zhen left.In their circle, the Lu family stood at the top of the pyramid with its strong financial resources and deep foundation. At present, Master Lu was in power, but the second generation of the Lu family was on the verge of death. The eldest son died in a car accident in his early years, leaving only one illegitimate son who could not even succeed him. There was only one boy in the third generation of the Lu family. He was undoubtedly the successor of power.Therefore, when Lu Zhen came and left whenever he wanted to. No one dared to say more.It took a while before they could recover, the elders continued to socialize as if nothing had happened. Chu Qiuqiu and Fu Mingxuan got excited for nothing. They weren\u2019t able to have a conversation with him, let alone face each other. They were all disheartened.Chu Yin secretly breathed a sigh of relief.She turned her head and suddenly saw that her brother was also in a state of combat as if preparing to go to war.Did my brother hate Lu Zhen so early? she thought.Gu Qiuze had become accustomed to Lu Zhen. He turned his head and smiled at Chu Yin: \u201cDo you know he\u2019s one of the celebrities in your grade?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s little face did not fluctuate: \u201cDon\u2019t know, probably from a different class.\u201dChu Shi was calm on the surface, but happy in his heart. His sister was not in the same class as the son of a bitch. She was much safer like this.Gu Qiuze raised his eyebrows: \u201cEven the girls in our grade go crazy for him.\u201dChuy Yin calmly replied, \u201cYes, but I don\u2019t think he is handsome at all.\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026.\u201dEven if he and Lu Zhen were not friendly with each other, but from his aesthetic point of view, Lu Zhen\u2019s face was quite good. Gu Qiuze had been confident in his appearance but suddenly wavered. He looked at Chu Shi for verification hoping to get an objective evaluation.Who knew that Chu Shi with a cold face, said, very surely: \u201cYes, Lu Zhen is not handsome at all.\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026.\u201dOkay, you deserve to be brothers and sisters.On that night, people in the circle were wondering why Lu Zhen suddenly appeared at the banquet of the Chu family. After all, young master Lu acknowledged that he did not like to attend such an occasion.Because of Lu Zhen\u2019s name, it spread all night, and almost all the people in Huiwen were eating melons.\u201cDid you say that Brother Zhen went there to meet someone?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible \u2013 but if he wants to meet someone, why does he come and leave?\u201d\u201cHe really just left?\u201d\u201cReally ah, I have a friend who attended. Brother Zhen didn\u2019t even stay for a second.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t join the group nor read the forum, so she didn\u2019t know how far the misunderstanding had reached because of her word change.The next day, class 5 surrounded Fu Mingxuan when they saw her.\u201cXuanxuan, what happened last night?\u201dChu Yin was also at the scene. She was from the Chu family, but of course, no one would ask her.Fu Mingxuan cleared her throat: \u201cBrother Zhen suddenly came. I was in the hall on the first floor. I thought he looked at me\u2026\u201dChu Yin was silent for a moment when he heard this sentence.\u2014\u2014With all due respect, there was no such look in that dog man\u2019s eyes in his script.But the melon eating crowd was all boiling: \u201cHoly crap!\u201d\u201cSo Lu Zhen went there just to see Xuanxuan?\u201d\u201cTrue or false\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201dFu Mingxuan\u2019s cheeks gradually reddened. She did not want to mislead them, but under the public praise and jealous expressions of some girls, even she believed it herself.What if it\u2019s true? Maybe Lu Zhen came to see her?\u201cXuanxuan, do you want to check if he showed up for you?\u201d\u201cYes, if that means\u2026\u201dFu Mingxuan went to the international class under the instigation of a group of little sisters.Turning over a page of the textbook, Chu Yin thought: if Fu Mingxuan could take Lu Zhen down, she would unilaterally declare Fu Mingxuan as her second birth parent and her great benefactor.Unfortunately, Fu Mingxuan came back disappointed ten minutes later.\u201cLu Zhen is not here\u2026\u201dPeople comforted her: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Brother Zhen often doesn\u2019t come to school. You can ask again tomorrow.\u201dUnfortunately, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t come to school tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow\u2019s tomorrow.In the beginning, class 5 comforted Fu Mingxuan, but later the atmosphere became a little awkward. Not only did Fu Mingxuan lose face, but the melon eaters were also very disappointed.Only Chu Yin felt that she had ushered in the spring of life.These days, after finishing the study task, Chu Yin would read the script. Indeed, she did not see Lu Zhen, that dog man. She was happy as if she had returned to her 17-year-old youth.The sky was blue, the water was sweet! How nice was it to be reborn, long live freedom!\u2026\u2026Two days later, Song Zhaolin went to the international class during break time. When he walked back to the classroom, he saw Chu Yin looking out the window at the blue sky.Although she was still wearing a mask and no one could see her expression clearly, he could feel that Chu Yin was in a good mood.They had been deskmates for awhile, yet Song Zhaolin hadn\u2019t talked to her that much. Because Chu Yin was always busy studying, Song Zhaolin was embarrassed to fall asleep in his desk.Today, it was rare to see that Chu Yin was not busy. Song Zhaolin sat down coquettishly: \u201cDeskmate~\u201dChu Yin moved her head: \u201cEh?\u201dBeing looked at by her clear eyes, Song Zhaolin felt incredibly nervous. He grabbed his hair and looked for a topic: Well, did you see Brother Zhen at your Chu family banquet that day?\u201dAt the mention of Lu Zhen\u2019s name, Chu Yin turned cold in seconds: \u201cWho?\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s eyes widened: \u201cLu Zhen! Our brother Zhen \u2014 don\u2019t say you don\u2019t know?\u201dChu Yin calmly asked, \u201cDo I need to know?\u201dSong Zhaolin almost choked.As he coughed, he thought, his deskmate was really a beautiful woman!There was only learning in her heart and nothing else. But listening to others say that Chu Yin\u2019s study was very poor, Song Zhaolin sometimes felt a little distressed \u2013 she had worked so hard yet results were not good. It would be better if she did not study at all.Song Zhaolin thought a lot before he casually said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you to him next time. Maybe you haven\u2019t met him? Yes, brother Zhen was recently called to the company by his father to deal with his official business\u2026 \u201cChu Yin did not react, but after listening to the last sentence, she suddenly laughed: \u201cSo that\u2019s it\u2026\u201dAs soon as she laughed, her eyes bent and her beautiful eyelashes fluttered. Her clear pupil was rippling with bright waves, like a broken lake showing a sense of beauty.Song Zhaolin lost his voice. He was dazzled in an instant.When Chu Yin walked out happily with her book, Song Zhaolin regained his mind and spoke slowly,\u201c\u2026\u2026 And then he came back today. \u201cSong Zhaolin scratched his head and felt that Chu Yin had misunderstood something.Chu Yin came out of class 5 with her notes and planned to recite it on the roof.\u201cHost, are you in a good mood?\u201dIndeed, Chu Yin walked briskly to the door with her textbook. But before she arrived, she suddenly felt that there was something wrong with the atmosphere \u2013 there were usually no people here, but today, people were standing in every corner. When they saw her coming, they glared at her with a hostile look.Chu Yin:?Did everyone fall in love with staying on the rooftop?Chu Yin sighed and was trying to find a quiet place again when a familiar silhouette appeared in the corner of her eyes.Turning her head inch by inch, she saw the person who was said to be \u2018called to the company to deal with official business\u2019The person\u2019s head slightly lowered as he walked out of the small door.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026.\u201d\u2026\u2026Song Zhaolin, you donkey!!Xueji: \u201cLife is like a roller coaster. It has its ups and downs. Be happy.\u201dHappy my butt.She now understood the male lead\u2019s halo.Chu Yin stabilized her mind. She was currently wearing a mask and a school uniform and it won\u2019t attract attention. There were so many people waiting for Lu Zhen in this area. He might not notice her.The girls around were consciously following Lu Zhen. Chu Yin looked calm as she looked ahead, walking over with a book.Lu Zhen lazily closed his eyes. Sure enough, he didn\u2019t even look at anyone around him.Chu Yin rubbed her shoulder while squinting and scolded him in her heart. In her last life, she was a fool.Lu Zhen had just finished smoking, and there was a faint smell of tobacco.He was walking carelessly, but suddenly, at a certain moment, a light fragrance reached the tip of his nose.The scent was very unique. It was like the smell of flowers after it bloomed. It was very light and had a subtle sense of familiarity, which made him feel inexplicable.Lu Zhen suddenly stopped and turned around only to find nothing: \u201cYou\u2013\u201cAs soon as he spoke, countless people turned around,But there was no one behind him.\u2026\u2026\u201cAfter I left, Lu Zhen looked back?\u201d\u201cYes, host.\u201dIn the evening, after finishing her homework task, Chu Yin looked at the script that was unlocked\u2014\u2014\u3010In the corridor, Lu Zhen turned around and watched quietly for a long time.\u3011Chu Yin thought: Whatever the dog man looked at\u2026she should change the word \u201cwatch\u201d to \u201ckneel\u201d!Xueji was silent. It had already accepted its host\u2019s personality.Chu Yin was refreshed after thinking this way, then looked down and was surprised again\u3010Location: Lujia. Character: Lu Zhen.\u3011\u3010\u2026Lu Zhen had a dream that the evening. In the dream, it was raining finely. Lu Zhen saw a girl who was wearing a floral skirt without an umbrella. The jasmine was in full bloom on the school campus. He walked uncontrollably towards the girl, trying to hold her shoulder.\u3011Chu Yin couldn\u2019t stop sneering after reading it.She held the light pen, thought for a moment, and asked the system, \u201cI have permission for one word, right?\u201dXueji: \u201cYes.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cAdding a word, right?\u201dXueji thought for a moment, but couldn\u2019t refute: \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dChu Yin was satisfied.Then she added the word \u201cbad\u201d before \u201cdream\u201dShe sneered: Still dreaming of me, you deserve this!!Late at night, Lujia villa.The light was still on in the young master\u2019s room.Mr. Lu started to transfer some of the company\u2019s power to Lu Zhen. Because of that, he still had a lot to learn. He sat at his desk and read all the reports sent by the company, then he raised his neck and rubbed his eyebrows.He got up to take a shower then turned off the lights in the room.In the large room, there was the smell of air freshener that faintly dissipated in the air.Lu Zhen leaned on the soft pillow, and somehow, suddenly remembered the light fragrance he smelled during the day. There was an indescribable weight lingering in the bottom of his heart.After a long time, he gradually fell asleep.It rained in his dream. There was a figure in the rain.It was a girl in a floral skirt. She had a slender back. She was not afraid of getting wet in the rain. Her long, slightly curly hair draped behind her, the ends of her hair dangling playfully.The skirt was not beautiful, but Lu Zhen felt a kind of unspeakable palpitation.He followed, trying to stop her.But the girl walked faster and faster, and Lu Zhen ran to catch up to her.Finally, he held her shoulder: \u201cYou\u2013\u201cThe girl turned her head and showed a hideous face. She opened her mouth and called out wildly,\u2014\u2014\u201dLu Zhen! You! Stupid!\u201dLu Zhen immediately woke up from fright.A long time later, a sigh sounded in the empty dark room.\u201c\u2026\u2026Fuck.\u201d He said softly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6 \u2013 The dog man came to me againChu Yin had a good dream.When she woke up, the sun had already covered her bedroom. She was in a good mood as she stretched herself out on the bed.Then she suddenly remembered something and asked the system: \u201cDo you care about after-sales feedback?\u201dXueji: \u201cGood morning, host~ What kind of after-sales service is it?\u201dChu Yin rubbed her hands expectantly: \u201cHow about the effect of the nightmare package? Did you scare him to the point he peed himself?\u201dXueji: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, we\u2019re not an evil system that finds happiness in bad things!\u201dChu Yin was disappointed as she got out of bed.After washing, Chu Yin walked out of the room, wearing the simple baggy Huiwen\u2019s school uniform.As soon as she opened the door of the room, she saw Chu Qiuqiu wearing a beautiful short skirt while lovingly holding Chu Shi as they step down the stairs. \u201cBrother, will you take the car with me to school later? I want to ask you a question.\u201dChu Shi nodded noncommittally: \u201cOk.\u201dThe parents of the Chu family had already sat down at the dining table downstairs. After hearing this, they expressed their admiration: \u201cQiuqiu is so hardworking. It\u2019s really a relief for mom and dad.\u201dChu Qiuqiu, with a well-behaved and sensible smile, gave a triumphant glance at Chu Yin as she came down.Their parents preferred her more. Although her brother made her lose face at the banquet before, maybe he didn\u2019t like her bringing many people to him? Otherwise, how could he be more partial to Chu Yin, who he had not met for ten years?Chu Yin didn\u2019t even look at her. She went to the dining table and her brother opened the chair beside him: \u201cSit here.\u201dShe nodded and sat down next to Chu Shi.Chu Qiuqiu quietly curled her lips. Not only did this country bumpkin sister taste the soil, but she was also like a wooden stake, and she didn\u2019t even know how to express her gratitude.The Chu parents were usually very busy, and it was rare for them to get together for dinner.Father Chu sat on the seat, looked at the young, beautiful, and energetic children, and said with satisfaction: \u201cXiao Yin has finally returned. You are all members of the Chu family. From now on, you will help and support each other.\u201dChu Yin and Chu Shi\u2019s faces were both dull, only Chu Qiuqiu responded sweetly: \u201cYes, Dad! My sister\u2019s education level is different from ours so she naturally need to keep up with the progress, but don\u2019t worry! I will help her!\u201dThe parents nodded with relief.Chu Yin had no response. She didn\u2019t need Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s help plus she didn\u2019t recognize her as her sister. But Chu Shi beside her frowned. He thought Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s words sounded particularly harsh.\u201cWhy can\u2019t she keep up?\u201d Chu Shi said, \u201cI think Xiao Yin can since she often studies at night.\u201dMother Chu looked at her in surprise: \u201cIs Xiao Yin so diligent?\u201dFather Chu\u2019s interest was also piqued.Chu Yin drank the milk calmly: \u201cit\u2019s okay.\u201dShe didn\u2019t study hard for anyone to see. She studied for herself, not needing to please anyone.Because the elder brother helped Chu Yin speak, their parent\u2019s expressions showed a hint of approval. Chu Qiuqiu felt unhappy and smiled deliberately, \u201cSo, my sister\u2019s previous grades should be pretty good?\u201dChu Yin could see at a glance what Chu Qiuqiu was planning in her heart. She said casually, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dChu Qiuqiu rolled her eyes in her heart\u2013\u2019it\u2019s okay\u2019?She thought of the transcript that she found. Although it was not sent to her yet, Chu Qiuqiu already saw a photo of it in advance. Chu Yin\u2019s grades were exactly as she had imagined. She only got 69 out of the 150 math test. Was this grade okay? Her face was even pretending to be humble!From the time when Chu Yin answered the problem in the public class last time, Chu Qiuqiu discovered that this country bumpkin sister definitely wanted to prove herself by proving herself with her grades!Chu Qiuqiu smiled secretly in her heart. It seemed that she needed to find a suitable time to let everyone know her true level.\u2026When she got to school, Chu Yin remembered the matter with this donkey Song Zhaolin. Her eyes were filled with a trace of hidden resentment.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t get her real meaning and mistakenly thought that his appearance was too handsome today, which made Chu Yin look at him with attentiveness. He changed countless charming sitting positions back and forth between two classes.While doing the system task\u2019s questions, Chu Yin glanced at Song Zhaolin in puzzlement.Then the man immediately changed to another new position\u2013resting his chin with his right hand and looking at the blackboard at a 45-degree angle with a melancholy expression.Chu Yin is sure.Her deskmate probably had hemorrhoids. So pitiful.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t know that he had fallen into a hidden disease in Chu Yin\u2019s heart. He was peeped into two classes by Chu Yin\u2019s eyes, and the whole person was in a state of ecstasy.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t know that he had already suffered from a hidden illness in Chu Yin\u2019s heart.After class, Song Zhaolin went to the international class at a fast pace.He walked to the back row where Lu Zhen and Tan Ke. Song Zhaolin went there and said confidently, \u201cAm I extremely handsome today?\u201dLu Zhen laid on the table, not paying attention to him.But Tan Ke Le said, \u201cDid you take the wrong medicine?\u201dSong Zhaolin shook his head: \u201cThe beauty sitting next to me had looked at me two times between two classes. I suspect it\u2019s because I\u2019m handsome today!\u201dLu Zhen slowly straightened up from the table and showed a handsome face full of drowsiness from his arm. At present, he was still a little green and black, and the brown and red tear mole was listless.Lu Zhen slowly got off the table and straightened up, revealing a handsome face full of sleepiness. His eyes looked tired and listless.Song Zhaolin blinked.Lu Zhen spat out: \u201cRoll.\u201dSong Zhaolin obeyed the order immediately.As he rolled out, he wondered\u2013Why did brother Zhen look so sleepy today? Did he not sleep well?When it finally became quiet, Lu Zhen leaned back on the table again.He had nightmares back to back last night and couldn\u2019t sleep.When Song Zhaolin came back, Chu Yin was still struggling with the hardest question.\u201cHost, you seem to be struggling. Can you finish the task this time?\u201dChu Yin bit the tip of her pen, her brain rapidly working.She vaguely felt that after the completion of each task, the task difficulty and rewards seemed to be gradually increasing. For example, she could solve the previous hardest problem smoothly, but this time, the math problem was obviously more difficult.After thinking about the problem, Chu Yin still couldn\u2019t solve it for a while. It just so happened that it was break time, she was going to ask her math teacher.Just as Song Zhaolin returned to his seat, Chu Yin thought for a moment and asked him, \u201cWhere have you been?\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s heart had a burst of excitement \u2013 his deskmate began to care about what he was doing!In the past, she only had books in her heart!But now, he was part of it!Song Zhaolin told her: \u201cI went to the international class, but I didn\u2019t stay long because brother Zhen was sleepy and wanted to go to sleep, I rolled back\u2026\u201dChu Yin got the answer she wanted and stood up with her test paper.Lu Zhen was in the classroom\u2013safe! \u221aAfter Chu Yin left, several people in class 5 laughed.\u201cIf I\u2019m not mistaken, will this \u2018bookworm\u2019 student in our class ask the teacher?\u201d said a girl named Xing Lan.Both she and Fu Mingxuan were one of the top students in class 5, and they simply scoffed at Chu Yin\u2019s behavior.\u201cLan Lan, study committee member, would you like to have a look? I\u2019m afraid that the question \u201cXueba\u201d asks is too simple, which will make our sister Wang angry. \u201d Fu Mingxuan said sarcastically.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll take a look.\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin walked into the math office and found the math teacher in class 5. She politely greeted the teacher.Although she didn\u2019t answer questions in class, she still listened well. This teacher surnamed Wang gave a good lecture.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dTeacher Wang was a typical female teacher. She liked good students but had a general attitude towards poor students and students that didn\u2019t make an impression. The transfer student in front of her was obviously the latter. With her head down while wearing a mask every day, she still didn\u2019t know what this student looked like.Chu Yin took out her paper and said, \u201cThere is a question I want to ask you.\u201dTeacher Wang saw that she was still self-motivated, so she patiently looked at it, \u201cWhich one?\u201dChu Yin pointed to the last big question of the paper: \u201cThis.\u201dTeacher Wang saw that this was the most difficult final question in the whole set of papers. It was very difficult that only the top students in the grade could do it.She looked again and found that the whole set of papers for this student was blank, and she only did this question. She was so angry that this student didn\u2019t even try to solve the other questions- What she hates most is this kind of ambitious student that has no skill at all.Teacher Wang patted the paper: \u201cYou didn\u2019t do the previous questions. Can you guarantee that they are all correct?\u201dFor Chu Yin, all the questions except for the last two questions were very simple to her. It\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t do it, but she only prioritized the hardest questions first.As Chu Yin was about to speak, a voice suddenly came behind her: \u201cTeacher, is Student Chu already at this level? I can\u2019t even solve the second question.\u201dTeacher Wang looked at Xing Lan, a good student in the class, with a soft look: \u201cDon\u2019t learn from her!\u201dXing Lan chuckled and laughed: \u201cTeacher, I thought Chu Yin is very good at learning.\u201dChu Yin put away her papers. It seemed that she couldn\u2019t ask for help from this teacher.Her eyes looked around the office, leaving only one teacher present. She thought about it and walked over with the paper.\u201cExcuse me, teacher. Can I ask you a question?\u201dThe teacher was older. He didn\u2019t know Chu Yin nor her level. After taking the paper, he looked at Chu Yin\u2019s solving steps.At this time, he was surprised.The girl\u2019s handwriting was neat and clear. He could see her good foundation and thinking ability.The difficulty of this question was far beyond the scope of high school students, and her solution had obviously exceeded the knowledge range of the high school.The old teacher followed Chu Yin\u2019s problem-solving ideas and continued to explain to her. Unfortunately, just halfway through the lecture, the class bell rang.Although Chu Yin was regretful, it was not good to delay the class. The teacher saw that she was clever and liked her in her heart. He said with a smile, \u201cCome, follow me to my class. I\u2019ll send out the pre-class quiz, and then I\u2019ll finish explaining it for you.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyes brightened: \u201cThank you!\u201dOn the other side, after Xing Lan returned to the classroom, she said with an exaggerated smile: \u201cThe \u2018bookworm\u2019 actually asked help with the final question from teacher Wang which made her angry to death!\u201dFu Mingxuan looked at her manicure and said with disdained: \u201cA poor student is precisely like this.\u201d\u201cThe most amusing thing is that after she was scolded by teacher Wang, she turned to find the teacher on the opposite corner.\u201dFu Mingxuan was just about to open her mouth to laugh when suddenly she realized something: \u201cTeacher seating diagonally from teacher Wang? That\u2019s the math teacher in the international class.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d\u201cWhat does this mean? Did the country bumpkin do this on purpose so she could go to the international class!\u201d\u2014\u2014They all knew who was in the international class.Fu Mingxuan was immediately upset, and she had always had an inexplicable hostility towards this country bumpkin, which at the moment, was getting stronger.Xing Lan quickly comforted her: \u201cXuanxuan, don\u2019t think about it. Even if she lies in front of brother Zhen, brother Zhen will not look at her, okay?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. How can Lu Zhen look at her?\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin looked at the class card at the back door of the international class and felt a burst of heart attack.The old teacher looked back and kindly told her, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Don\u2019t be afraid. Come in.\u201dChu Yin pursed her lips and followed the teacher in through the back door.There was a small gust of wind when she passed.A moment later, the boy sleeping on his stomach straightened up.Lu Zhen took a breath as he smelled the light fragrance again.Chu Yin and the teacher stood on the platform.She was forcing herself to focus on the topic \u2013 only after finishing this problem could she have the authority, and only when she had the authority could she change her life.\u201cQiuqiu, isn\u2019t that your sister?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her? Why did she come to our class just to ask a question?\u201dChu Qiuqiu looked at Chu Yin on the platform and laughed.There were too many girls with this kind of mind. Every day, girls from different classes would come to see Lu Zhen who was in the international class.No one noticed that in the corner of the classroom, Lu Zhen sat up straight. His black hair was slightly disordered, his black eyes half-closed as he looked at the figure on the platform.Finally, the old teacher explained to her the last step. Chu Yin sincerely said thanks and then turned around and left.While walking, she asked the system, \u201cCan I unlock the script now?\u201dXueji: \u201cTask is deemed completed once the host finish all the problems~\u201dChu Yin pursed her lips, okay, she\u2019d just do it as soon as possible.She quickened her pace and walked out of the international class.People in the international class made fun of her. Most of the girls implicitly thought that the girl came to see Lu Zhen. Otherwise, who would ask other teachers?It\u2019s a pity that Lu Zhen wouldn\u2019t have any interest in her.But at this moment, there was a sound of a chair across the ground from the back of the classroom.Someone opened the classroom door and went out.Before Chu Yin finished her breath, she heard a cold voice behind her: \u201cWait a minute.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026..\u201dThe dog man came to her again!She wanted to run, but the boy caught up after a few steps.Chu Yin had to look back, although his face was as usual, but his heart had listed his eighty ways of death in the script tonight.Chu Yin had no choice but to look back. Although her face remained calm as usual, she had already listed 80 ways for him to die in the script tonight.What matter was so important that he had to talk to her?The 17-year-old Lu Zhen stood in front of her, looked down, and asked, \u201cWhat kind of perfume are you using?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d\u4e00She almost blurted the famous line of \u201cYou\u2019re so good\u00a01\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 \u2013 Interruption in the ForumDog man was truly a dog.Although his voice at this time was different from his cold voice many years later, it still overlapped with the man in Chu Yin\u2019s memory.He liked to embraced her waist and hold her in his arms. The tip of his nose would deeply sniff Chu Yin\u2019s neck.\u201cWhat perfume?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was hoarse, \u201cIt smells so good\u2026\u201dHe would ask all the time until Chu Yin would answer him. Then, one time Chu Yin forcibly answered that there was no perfume. It was just the smell of liquid soap and detergent.And this time, Chu Yin was still asked the same question by the same person.She suddenly realized that some things would never change. Since she could not completely avoid the dog man, wouldn\u2019t it be faster to make him hate her?After all, she knew what Lu Zhen liked.The heir of the Lu family looked deep and strong, but actually, he liked wild roses with thorns. The Chu Yin in the previous life was unruly and reckless. She turned against him in all aspects, rejected and rebelled against him, but despite this, he accepted her behavior.Now, she would become the kind of good student that he disliked the most.\u2014\u2014Plain, timid, and dull. He would never expect to be killed from behind.Chu Yin licked her lips. She showed a puzzled expression while her voice was flat and gentle as she said, \u201cClassmate, I don\u2019t know any perfume.\u201dLu Zhen also felt a little impulsive. He nodded and raised his eyes carelessly, but suddenly he saw the fine hair of her forehead. Her eyes were as clear as glass, and even her confusion was clear.Lu Zhen was impulsive at first. He nodded and raised his eyes inadvertently, seeing the fine hairs from her forehead. Her eyes were clear as glass, showing clear confusion.The girl wore a mask and a baggy school uniform, making her look like a peaceful little nerd. She exuded a hidden loathing, just like the instinctive resistance of a good student to a bad boy.Although Lu Zhen was not interested in such a person, he couldn\u2019t understand why his heart felt like there was a soft thorn that was gently pricking him.\u201cDo you know me?\u201d He asked.Chu Yin grinned with her teeth under her mask.Not only did she know him, this old lady even knew that there was a mole between his abdomen and mermaid line!But on the surface, she just frowned, as if finding it strange.After a silence, she finally shook her head: \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s dark eyes looked at her and thought: Forget it.The girl\u2019s retreating back was slender while her head hung slightly, giving a feeling that she could easily disappear in a crowd at any time\u2013Boring and harmless. Lu Zhen watched her turn the corner before turning away.He did not know that the \u201charmless\u201d rabbit was a wolf under his skin. She was grinding her paws as she walked awayHe didn\u2019t know that the \u201charmless\u201d little white rabbit was actually a wolf. While leaving, she was grinding her hands while being in thought: She didn\u2019t deserve to be called Chinese if she couldn\u2019t kill this dog man!From the moment Lu Zhen walked out of the classroom, the students in the international class exploded.\u201cDamn, did brother Zhen talked to that woman?\u201d\u201cWho is she? She knows brother Zhen?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t she the country bumpkin that was brought back from the village by the Chu family?\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s expression was ugly in the face of people\u2019s questions.She also didn\u2019t know why her sister and Lu Zhen talked.Soon, the news spread quickly like a rocket throughout the school. The whole school knew that there was a girl who went to the international class who got to talk to Lu Zhen by just asking questions.Fu Mingxuan\u2019s whole body exploded in anger. She couldn\u2019t believe it. Lu Zhen never paid attention to her. The most words he had ever said to her was when she gifted him. But according to her friends in the international class, Lu Zhen stayed outside the classroom for several minutes!! That country bumpkin spoke to Lu Zhen in those minutes?!The entire class 5 couldn\u2019t calm down. The people kept looking back and glaring at Chu Yin.Song Zhaolin secretly asked Chu Yin, \u201cDeskmate, do you know brother Zhen?\u201dChu Yin was venting her anger by solving questions. She replied coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dSong Zhaolin didn\u2019t think she knew him. When he asked her before, she answered that she didn\u2019t know Lu Zhen.\u201cWhy did you talk to brother Zhen?\u201d Song Zhaolin covered his mouth to avoid the teacher\u2019s eyes and said quietly, \u201cAll girls like him like crazy.\u201dChu Yin squeezed the pen\u2019s finger with a burst of force: \u201cIt\u2019s him who talked to me.\u201dSong Zhaolin had an expression of \u2018Although I won\u2019t laugh at you, don\u2019t treat me as a fool either.\u2019When the bell rang, Fu Mingxuan came with her little friends.Chu Yin was immersed in her studies every break time. She looked like a soft persimmon that was easy to pinch. Fu Mingxian\u2019s questioning voice reached her ears, \u201cHey, what did you say to Lu Zhen?!\u201dChu Yin turned the pen in her hand and raised her eyes: \u201cDoes it concern you?\u201dSong Zhaolin clapped in his heart. As expected of his sister Yin!!Fu Mingxuan was surprised. She didn\u2019t expect her to act like this.She was angry: \u201cDid you pester him? How else would he talk to you? You must have played tricks! What did you say?\u201dThis time, Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t stand it anymore: \u201cAh\u2014\u201cChu Yin slapped the pen on the table and looked at her with a smile: \u201cDo you think I am you?\u201dFu Mingxuan felt her blood was boiling: \u201cYou?\u201dChu Yin stood up indifferently and pushed her away.\u201cIf you want to know, ask Lu Zhen.\u201d\u2026\u2026That night, someone in the anonymous forum of Huiwen created a new post\u2014\u2014[On August 18, a female student went to an international class to ask questions and talked to Lu Zhen.]The student Chu Yin, a transfer student in class 5, is the adopted daughter that was picked up from the countryside by the Shi family. She is the sister of Chu Qiuqiu and Chu Shi, a handsome senior.The words \u2018Lu Zhen\u2019 attracted traffic from the forum. As soon as the post was published, there were countless followers in an instant.Anonymous 1: First! Because the creator of this online post used Lu Zhen\u2019s name, this will generate a lot of audiences.Anonymous 2: I heard about this. People who grew up in rural villages are cheeky and stubborn.Anonymous 3: So where did she get the face to hook up with Lu Zhen?? I don\u2019t believe she just went there to ask a question.Anonymous 4: To reply to the previous comment, it\u2019s because she has no face that she dared to hook up.\u2026\u2026Different major groups and classes came to discuss in this post.Because Lu Zhen is too extraordinary while occupying the most handsome boy title in school, many people liked him. He was not as gentle and talkative as Gu Qiuze, the former titleholder of the most handsome boy in school. Even though most girls liked him, they dared not cross the minefield. They were satisfied with just looking at him.Because someone broke this balance, people went crazy.Gradually, the melon-seed eating crown gave justifications for their benefit about the situation with Lu Zhen. They all thought that the country bumpkin was very clever. She deliberately asked a difficult question to the international class\u2019 teacher. Because she asked this difficult question, it attracted Lu Zhen\u2019s attention, resulting in Lu Zhen and her discussing the question.Although it was said that Lu Zhen was interested in that person, the girls were more willing to believe this statement.Then someone asked in the post\u2014\u2014Anonymous 70: So does the country bumpkin really study well?Anonymous 71: Maybe she was the top student in their village?? She was also able to answer a very difficult question in the public math class.Chu Qiuqiu had been paying close attention to the progress of the post. Seeing this post, she smiled- this was the right time.A few minutes later, Fu Mingxuan, who was replying to \u201cShit, she\u2019s not a top student but a pretender.\u201d she received an anonymous email.She opened it and read it.\u201c!!!\u201dAnother ten minutes later, a new post was dropped in the forum\u2014\u2014[Come and take a look at the transcript record of the daughter of the Chu family\u2019s \u2018top student\u2019~!]A picture was posted and it showed Chu Yin\u2019s name in the list.Chinese \u2013 102Mathematics \u2013 69English \u2013 99Literature and comprehensive subject \u2013 161Total score 431, ranking 302.Anonymous 1: Damn! It\u2019s really eye-catching!Anonymous 2: Is this the top student? More than 300 people have outranked her in the village. I\u2019m laughing so hard. HahahahaAnonymous 3: With this evidence, it can prove that Chu Yin is a scheming bitch, pretending to be a top student to attract brother Zhen\u2019s attention. Disgusting!The transcript record spread quickly among the high school sophomores. At this time, no one cared that this was evading people\u2019s privacy, everyone was just eating melon seeds.In the chat group:Fu Mingxuan: [God, I thought she did well! She works very hard in our class.]Xing Lan: [I thought so too!]Chu Qiuqiu: [Don\u2019t talk about my sister. Sadly, she didn\u2019t get anything in return despite her efforts.]Although Chu Qiuqiu \u2018defended\u2019 her, there was still a group of people mocking Chu Yin\u2019s achievements.Just then, a new message popped up in the group.Lu Zhen: [Who created the post?]The group exploded in an instant.[Ah ah ah ah, brother Zhen actually appeared in the group!!! ][Screenshot this copper mine\u00a01.][Copper mine\u221a]\u2026\u2026Fu Mingxuan: [In fact, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to post this transcript. After all, it\u2019s the privacy of others. It\u2019s really bad to post it casually.]Chu Qiuqiu: [Please don\u2019t laugh at my sister anymore. Since she has poor grades, I will help her study QAQ\u00a02.]After Chu Qiuqiu finished her purpose, she quit the messenger group and went to the anonymous forum again.The post blew up. They were all mocking Chu Yin. Chu Qiuqiu browsed through it with great interest. One of the anonymous said, \u201cHaving poor grades should not be a reason for her to be bullied like this.\u201dChu Qiuqiu replied to that post, \u201cSince she has poor grades, she doesn\u2019t need to pretend to be a top student. Naturally more and more people will mock her.\u201dHaving finished typing, she walked out of the room and looked at Chu Yin\u2019s closed door. She was very proud.The anonymous forum was good. Every registered student in Huiwen had a dedicated account and could put their real name, but of course, no one would do that. Everyone enjoys the feeling of speaking freely.Chu Yin must be in a panic now.\u2026\u2026Chu Yin had just finished her homework.\u201cDrop \u2013 task completed \u221a Unlock the script on the next page and get the [change word] permission.\u201dWhen the glowing book opened, Xueji said, \u201cHost, the current plot is exciting.\u201dAfter reading the script, she went and took a look at the forum. A variety of monsters, ghosts, and snakes were tearing the forum, which made it to the top post of the page.She blamed all this on the stupid Lu Zhen\u2026Her phone dinged and her brother sent a WeChat message: \u201cXiao Yin, don\u2019t believe those on the internet. Let brother handle this\u2026\u201dTwo seconds later, he sent another message: \u201cDo you want ice cream?\u201dHer brother was afraid that she would be sad. He treated her like a child.Xueji was also worried: \u201cHost, since the situation turned out like this, what are you going to do? \u201cEven if you had the authority, you couldn\u2019t reverse the time and stop them from posting.Chu Yin supported her cheek with one hand and raised her delicate eyebrow. She had poor grades in her previous life so the transcript was indeed hers. She knew it was Chu Qiuqiu who obtained it. Since it was already posted, she didn\u2019t care about it.But even with a gold finger, she was screwed like this.Chu Yin moved her light pen and landed on a certain word in the script\u2014\u2014\u201dWant to play?\u201dShe changed the word [Anonymous] to [Real-Name]\u201cLet everyone play \u2013 Huiwen\u2019s Real-Name Forum welcomes you.\u201dAt 10:39 p.m., the Huiwen forum collapsed for a second.A second later, under the head portrait on each anonymous post, a real account name suddenly appeared!!Multiple people who acted like a white-lotus suddenly had no escape.Chu Yin squinted.Come on, let\u2019s run naked together3~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 \u2013 Being Choke in the throatFu Mingxuan sent several messages in the chat group.Lu Zhen usually never uses this social software. He couldn\u2019t be seen in all these kinds of chat groups. So when he appeared once, Fu Mingxuan was very excited.[Brother Zhen has shown up. Everyone should stop posting. Let the post sink down.]After sending this sentence, she quit the chat group and went to the forum. It was strange that just a moment ago, her post was in the top search of the forum, but why did it suddenly go inactive? There were no new replies.So Fu Mingxuan replied\u2014\u2014323 (Fu Mingxuan): Such a good post is not allowed to sink!After sending out the post, she vaguely felt that there was something with the forum interface. At this time, Xing Lan suddenly sent her a message: \u201cXuanxuan, don\u2019t reply anymore!\u201d\u201cThe forum shows the creator\u2019s real name!!!\u201dBoom! A thunderbolt from the blue1\u2014\u2014Fu Mingxuan suddenly looked at it and found that her name appeared under her account!How could this happen??? How could a good anonymous forum reflect the user\u2019s real name??Then what she said in the group and the forum post was seen by people?!!Fu Mingxuan was flustered, but she comforted herself with a positive mindset: Just now, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t appear again in the chat group after asking who created the post. He was probably just asking casually. Would he be concerned about this insignificant thing?Moreover, because the forum suddenly reflected everyone\u2019s real name, no one dared to reply. After the forum\u2019s anonymity broke, every post exploded, so Fu Mingxuan\u2019s post dropped gradually. She breathed a sigh of relief\u2014\u2014But the next second after refreshing, the post suddenly went to the top page!Someone replied!The whole school stared at it. At this moment, the post was opened one by one by people\u2014324 (Lu Zhen): @ 323 (Fu Mingxuan, creator of the post), are you stupid.The post was silent for a minute.And then\u2014\u2014325 (Tan Ke): I\u2019m sorry, hahahahaha326 (Song Zhaolin): I\u2019m sorry, too\u2026hahahahaha327 (Jiang Yan): Just like she said earlier, it\u2019s immoral to casually post people\u2019s transcript records.In the anonymous chat group, the crowd went crazy:[Damn! Brother Zhen directly crushed her!!!! ][So handsome, so handsome ah ahhh][It\u2019s not my fault. This kind of white lotus should be crushed directly. You can see what she said in the chat group versus in the forum post. Two-faced.]Fu Mingxuan hurriedly pulled her several little friends to help her speak but after a few minutes, the whole situation completely became uncontrollable. Her little friends did not dare to speak.First, she was severely attacked by the person she liked, and then she was ridiculed by countless people. After encountering several moods in her face, Fu Mingxuan finally cried on her bed.On the other hand, Chu Qiuqiu was very glad that she had sent the photo to Fu Mingxuan when she learned that the forum revealed the actual names. But before she breathed a sigh of relief, she suddenly realized that she also replied in the forum post.It\u2019s a pity that the fire she lit herself quickly caught her.Someone said in an anonymous group: \u201cNobody found out? If Fu Mingxuan is a small white lotus, Chu Qiuqiu is a big white lotus in this golden age!][Picture 1] [Picture 2]The first photo was in the chat group: Don\u2019t laugh at my sister, I will help her learn!The second photo was in the forum post: Since she has poor grades, she doesn\u2019t need to pretend to be a top student. She\u2019ll just die from being laughed at!When the two photos were put together, Chu Qiuqiu was given a big slap.[Is this a character collapse? I always thought Chu Qiuqiu is elegant.][She had always been a whore, okay? Boys just don\u2019t see it.][So Chu Qiuqiu doesn\u2019t accept her sister? Everything is merely an act.][Even though I don\u2019t like country bumpkins, I have to say, white lotus is more disgusting.]\u2026\u2026[I think we have overlooked a very important thing, where did the transcript record come from? ]Half an hour ago, various directly pointed to Chu Yin, but now, it\u2019s pointing towards Chu Qiuqiu.Seeing someone slowly following the source of the transcript record, Chu Qiuqiu panicked. She usually paid attention to her image\u2013always thinking whether her actions would be in line with the words and deeds of a wealthy daughter. But this time, all her past concerns about Chu Yin dissipated.Chu Qiuqiu simply chose to play dead. She only hoped that neither her brother nor Chu Yin watched the forum and that this incident would just pass away!But just when she thought about this, her phone screen lit up. Her brother Chu Shi sent her a We Chat message.[Apologize to Xiao Yin tomorrow. If not, I\u2019ll tell our parents about it.]Brother was actually protecting Chu Yin?!Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s heart became completely cold.\u2026\u2026It was in the middle of the night that the melon-seed eaters slowly dispersed, leaving only a few people in the anonymous group.[Anyone here? I dared not ask this tomorrow, but is Brother Zhen protecting the country bumpkin?][Protect your butt! Wouldn\u2019t it be the same with anyone?][Yes!!!][But I\u2019m so jealous wuwuwu. I\u2019d like to be mocked and scolded in a forum post as long as Brother Zhen speaks for me][You\u2019re insane.]The next day.International senior class.Gu Qiuze leaned on Chu Shi\u2019s table while drinking coffee as he asked, \u201cSo what\u2019s your sister\u2019s reaction?\u201d\u201cNo response,\u201d Chu Shi knew which sister he was asking then pointed to the table, \u201cIt\u2019s very distressing.\u201dOf course, he could guess where the transcript record came from. Chu Yin did not express even the slightest sadness, nor did she cry or asked him to defend herself in the post.Gu Qiuze sighed softly: \u201cYes, anonymity is a place to indulge viciousness.\u201dGu Qiuze didn\u2019t know about it until this morning. He was worried about Chu Yin. The little girl looked beautiful and quiet. She was so cute and timid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to fight back when she was bullied.Chu Shi frowned, and after a moment, he stood up: \u201cGo and see her.\u201dThis time Gu Qiuze consciously followed.Lu Zhen was also thinking about the same thing.It\u2019s because of him, after all.That girl\u2026Chu Yin. He knew her name yesterday.Lu Zhen read her name twice in silence. Her clear eyes floated in his mind as he thought aimlessly\u2013would a good student like her cry after being mocked?She did not defend herself in the post.After a moment, Lu Zhen thought that he should go apologize even though the girl seemed to dislike talking to him and showing resistance against him that she tried to hide.Next to him, Tan Ke who was carrying his clothes, called him: \u201cBrother Zhen, are you going to play ball?\u201dLu Zhen shook his head.Then he got up, left the classroom, and walked in the direction of class 5. As soon as he turned the corner, he saw the figure.She was still wearing the baggy school uniform. She stood by the window, slightly swaying her head. Because of the event last night, people kept glancing in her direction, but she was not affected by them at all.Lu Zhen paused then bought a can of sweet milk from the vending machine in the corridor.He bent over to take it out and when he turned around, he saw someone standing in front of Chu Yin.Gu Qiuze stood in front of her. He slightly lowered his head, said something, then raised his hand to touch her head.Chu Yin held the book in her chest and nodded her head twice. Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know what Gu Qiuze said that made Chu Yin laughed.He watched from afar for a long time before he looked down at the can of sweet milk in his hand, laughed, and threw it into the trash can.Lu Zhen turned around and left.It\u2019s normal to talk to other people.\u2026\u2026After Chu Yin made a big commotion in the forum, she didn\u2019t check the effect of her word change. However, judging from the embarrassment of Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s expression today and the fact that Fu Mingxuan asked for leave, it probably worked well.Many people in class 5 also looked at her with odd embarrassment when they met her today.After all, what they said behind the screen was disclosed to the public. And their sense of shame was undressed in front of their eyes.Chu Yin didn\u2019t care about the changing attitudes of these high school students. She still resumed studying.However, her brother felt that she had been wronged so much that he came to her after class and carefully spoke to her.Chu Yin felt warm-hearted and wanted to laugh a little.\u201cAfter our parents come back, I will tell them about it,\u201d Chu Shi touched her head with a gentle look. \u201cLet Qiuqiu formally apologize to you.\u201d\u201cYes, don\u2019t be afraid. Your brother is in charge.\u201dGu Qiuze also reached out to touch Chu Yin\u2019s head and found that her hair was soft and it felt good in his hands. No wonder Chu Shi liked to touch this girl\u2019s head.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help but nod.But Gu Quize\u2019s hand was soon knocked off by Chu Shi.Chu Shi looked at him with displeasure: \u201cYou haven\u2019t reached that point yet.\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dHow weird.But Chu Yin laughed and didn\u2019t care since Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s apology was unneeded. She had 10000 ways to clean up Chu Qiuqiu. She would execute it one by one. Everything depended on her mood.Moreover, she hadn\u2019t forgotten who the culprit was.\u2014\u2014If it weren\u2019t for Lu Zhen forcing her to answer, all this wouldn\u2019t happen!!Whenever Chu Yin was scolded in the forum, it would always be related to Lu Zhen!!Don\u2019t think about the past. Don\u2019t think any of it.She didn\u2019t get the chance to change a word about that dog man in yesterday\u2019s script. She would remember to do it later!In the evening, Chu Yin finally finished the system\u2019s daily task of answering historical questions.This kind of problem was more troublesome for her than the math problem. It focused on the direct cause, root cause, positive and negative effect. If she wanted to cover all aspects, she needed to research more to increase her logic ability. As long as there was a problem that hadn\u2019t been answered yet, the system would not give her permission to unlock the script. It took her a day to complete it.\u201cDing \u2013 Complete history problems \u221a unlock the script on the next page and get the permission of [change word].\u201dChu Yin held the light pen happily.Xueji coldly looked at the way its host rubbed her hands, knowing that she was filled with bad water.She has an angel-like face, but behind her back, there were little devil wings.\u2026\u2026It was late at night.Lu Zhen was not asleep yet.There was an inexplicable restlessness lingering in his heart like a shadow.When he thought of the faint fragrant he had smelled before, he sat up and turned on the bedside lamp.He asked the housekeeper to buy some aromatherapy. Although it was not the fragrant he wanted, it was better than nothing.\u2026\u2026When Chu Yin saw this script, she laughed faintly.\u3010He lit the scented candle. The fragrant was faint as it produced a refreshing smell.\u3011\u3010After a long time, Lu Zhen finally fell asleep\u3011She didn\u2019t know what kind of fragrant Lu Zhen wanted, but she could give him a wonderful and unforgettable nightShe asked the system: \u201cChicken\u00a02, is the idiom\u3010refreshing3\u00a0\u3011considered one word?\u201dXueji was already immune to the name, and after a few seconds, it confirmed, \u201cYes, according to the system\u2019s decision.\u201dChu Yin licked the corners of her lips and stroke the word \u201crefreshing\u201d.After such a long time, Xueji figured out the behavior pattern of this host. He said confidently, \u201cHost, I guess you\u2019ll change it into its antonym, such as stinky?\u201dChu Yin shook her index finger: \u201cNo, no, no.\u201dThat\u2019s not creative and it\u2019s not vivid enough.Chu Yin curled her lips and laughed like an angel. Then on the crossed-out idiom, she wrote a four-character idiom\u3010Stinky fish and rotten shrimp\u00a04\u3011\u201d\u201cThis Chinese idiom is considered one word.\u201d Chu Yin clapped her hands.Early in the morning, Lu Zhen woke up in suffocation.The night was quiet under the bright moon.The stench of fishy smell strangled his throat.After a few seconds, Lu Zhen sat up.He was silent on the empty big bed.For a moment, he thought he had been made into canned seafood.The author has something to say:Lu Zhen: I\u2019m not in the mood. Don\u2019t talk to me.Chu Yin: I did itPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 \u2013 Refuse to CommunicateWhen the Chu parents arrived after their business trip, Chu Shi formally told his parents the whole story that happened in the forum at dinner.Chu Qiuqiu pitifully winked at Chu Shi several times, but he didn\u2019t seem to see it at all. He told them exactly what Chu Qiuqiu plotted.Chu Qiuqiu was anxious and angry, but Chu Yin on the other side had a plain expression from the beginning to the end. She didn\u2019t seem affected at all even after she was ridiculed, was stabbed by her sister, and had her transcript records posted.Hearing that Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s taunted Chu Yin in the forum, Father Chu frowned: \u201cQiuqiu, how could you do such a thing? That\u2019s your sister.\u201dChu Qiuqiu was so scared that her heart almost leaped. But, she merely ridiculed her with one or two sentences ah. She didn\u2019t post her transcript in the forum. Would her parents scold her for this?Father Chu went on to say, \u201cYou are also the daughter of the Chu family. You represent the Chu family image. Now when outsiders see that you and your sisters are at odds, what would they think?\u201dChu Yin hooked her lips \u2013 she knew that what they cared most were their image and not her.When she was trapped by Lu Zhen in her previous life, the Chu parents believed that according to Lu Zhen\u2019s status and power, staying with him was not torture. After the Chu family went bankrupt, they even hoped they could obtain Lu Zhen\u2019s final support through her.They\u2019re only related by blood. From beginning to end, only her brother cared for her.Mother Chu followed, \u201cQiuqiu, a low-level social community like the forum is not the place where you should go. Mother will take you sisters to participate in more banquets so you\u2019ll get to know more people at our level.\u201dChu Shi frowned deeply and found that her parents didn\u2019t seem to pay attention to the key points.Chu Qiuqiu calmed down and smiled. Sure enough, Mom and Dad would not blame her! She was superior to Chu Yin in everything. She was the proudest daughter of the Chu family. How could they blame her for one mistake that she made?\u201cI understand, Mom and Dad. I won\u2019t do this again next time,\u201d Chu Qiuqiu lowered her head and deliberately said, \u201cActually, I was shocked when I saw my sister\u2019s report card that I just\u2026\u201dMother Chu only then remembered her kids\u2019 achievements. Chu Shi had just won an international award while Chu Qiuqiu was included in the top ten of her grade.Thinking of Chu Yin\u2019s grades, since she was also their daughter, they had to save the Chu family\u2019s pride.She thought and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know anything related to school, you can ask Qiuqiu, or we can hire tutors, so your grades will be\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough.\u201d Chu Shi suddenly interrupted Mother Chu.He was still wondering how much of the dream he dreamt on the plane was true. But looking at his parents\u2019 seemingly reasonable but actually biased performance, and his self-righteous sister who his family had raised for ten years, he suddenly realized that everything would happen.He raised his eyes to look at Chu Qiuqiu, his handsome eyes reflected the rare solemnity, \u201cAfter explaining so much, have you forgotten that there is still something you haven\u2019t done? Apologize.\u201dChu Qiuqiu looked at her brother in disbelief. Her parents didn\u2019t blame her. Why did her brother still hate her? For the sake of this country bumpkin Chu Yin?!But under Chu Shi\u2019s stern eyes, Chu Qiuqiu murmured aggrievedly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe father of Chu could not bear to see that he was close to his daughter who had been raising him for ten years. He said, \u201cwell, now it\u2019s time for the sisters to get back together again! In the future, you must love each other and support each other. \u201cFather Chu couldn\u2019t bear to see that the daughter he had been raising for ten years would stoop so slow. \u201cOkay. Now that\u2019s all done, you must love and support each other from now on.\u201dChu Shi observed all this and felt absurd.After seeing Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s two-faced actions, their father still expected them to peacefully get along with each other? Did they not care about the one who got hurt?In the process of their verbal battle, Chu Yin finished her meal in silence. She wiped her mouth with her napkin and stood up. \u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201dNeither did she respond to Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s apology, nor did she respond to Father Chu and Mother Chu\u2019s words.After she left, Chu Qiuqiu immediately turned to her parents and complained: \u201cLook at her, I\u2019ve already apologized yet she didn\u2019t even say a word\u2026\u201dChu Shi raised his eyes and said coldly, \u201cBecause your insincere apology doesn\u2019t deserve her response.\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face turned pale, but Chu Shi didn\u2019t pay attention to it. He got up and left.\u2026\u2026After Chu Yin returned to her room, she did not start studying just like her usual routine. She looked up slightly, her mind a little empty.\u201cHost, are you affected?\u201d Xueji asked her in a low voice.Yes.After dying disgracefully, she had a chance to start a new life. The golden finger she received gave her confidence in her own destiny, but in the end, she couldn\u2019t change these people.When she was separated from the Chu family when she was 5 years old, a family from the countryside adopted her. In that family, there was an older mentally retarded son. She was adopted to become that bride since she was a child. Because of this, she was treated only with leftovers.When Chu Yin came back to the Chu family in her last life, she really had fantasies about her biological parents, but the reality let her down.But it didn\u2019t matter. She would become strong enough in this life.She would leave the Chu family which would eventually go bankrupt, and escape Lu Zhen\u2019s palm.At this time, the door of the room was knocked.Chu Shi stood outside the door and asked Chu Yin in a low voice: \u201cangry?\u201dChu Yin laughed: \u201cNo. Brother, thank you\u2026really.\u201dChu Shi touched her head: \u201cI know that the transcript was obtained by Qiuqiu. I didn\u2019t pay attention to her small actions before which had wronged you.\u201dChu Yin felt it was a little strange. Why would her brother defend her without asking her side? It\u2019s like he understood the reason.She shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be sorry.\u201dLooking at his younger sister\u2019s delicate and rosy face, he remembered her pale and gloomy appearance after being imprisoned by Lu Zhen in his dream. He felt uncomfortable.Speaking of this, the forum-related incident was related to Lu Zhen. It seemed that the bastard still took the initiative to speak to Xiao Yin.Chu Shi asked tentatively, \u201cWhat do you think of Lu Zhen?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s heart leaped: \u201cLu Zhen?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Chu Shi observed Chu Yin\u2019s expression, \u201cThat bast\u2013no, did he say anything to you?\u201d\u201cSome nonsense,\u201d Chu Yin said after a pause, and then added, \u201c\u2026I think he\u2019s not right in the head.\u201dChu Shi was overjoyed with her replied, and affirmed: \u201cYour feeling is right. Lu Zhen is definitely not right in the head.\u201dAfter living for two lifetimes, Chu Yin finally found someone who she could speak ill of Lu Zhen together. She was emotional.\u201cThere are so many girls in school who like him. I think most of them are blind.\u201d\u201cYes, Gu Qiuze is much more handsome than him.\u201d\u201cHis personality is also strange. He doesn\u2019t seem to be good.\u201d\u201cSo you must stay away from that kind of fool.\u201d\u201cBrother, I will.\u201d\u2026\u2026After the two brothers and sisters ridiculed Lu Zhen, they each got spiritual satisfaction. They bid good night to each other happily.In order to avoid the limelight, Fu Mingxuan took a leave of absence for more than a week before returning to class.The mid-term exam would be in two weeks. Fu Mingxuan needed to go to school even if she didn\u2019t want to. She was still competing with Chu Qiuqiu for the exam rankings!After she came back, no one in the class mentioned the embarrassing event from last time. Fu Mingxuan spent the morning in the class and felt the familiar feeling. When she looked back again, she saw that Chu Yin was immersed in her studying as usual, and felt unhappy again.If it was not for her, she would not have been scolded by Lu Zhen. She must have left a very bad impression in Lu Zhen\u2019s mind at that time.Speaking of Chu Yin, this person\u2019s psychology was also very strong. Even when the whole school knew about her bad grades, she still studied hard every day.Fu Mingxuan felt a lot more comfortable thinking about it this way\u2014having poor grades was not pitiful, but having poor grades and yet still working hard was pitiful.Before the mid-term exam, there was an activity called Shakespeare English Week, which had become an old tradition of Huiwen.Because it was a general activity, there would senior students participating. All the girls were very excited. The mechanics of this English Week was for everyone to sit together and reciting the original English excerpts of Shakespeare. Because Huiwen was a high-end private school with an international department, it was possible to organize such an event.When Fu Mingxuan walked to Song Zhaolin\u2019s desk with the list of selected readings, she saw Chu Yin writing English in her papers.She felt proud. Although she was disgraced last time, but compared to Chu Yin whose transcript records were announced, was even more humiliating than her. She found comfort in this mindset.\u201cStudent Chu, would you like to take part in the activity? I remember your English is your strong point?\u201d\u2014\u2014Compared with her 69 points in mathematics, her 99 points in English was certainly a strong point.After Fu Mingxian finished speaking, Xing Lan and others immediately joined in, ridiculing her with their smile.Chu Yin had just finished answering a set of English questions in college entrance exam levels. She estimated she could reach pass 145. Sure enough, the \u2018ding\u2019 sound of the system was heard and she was granted permission for one word.Chu Yin looked up at Fu Mingxuan and said casually, \u201cAre you a fool?\u201dHearing this familiar sentence, Fu Mingxuan\u2019s face suddenly turned red.Song Zhaolin, who sat beside Chu Yin, couldn\u2019t hold back his laughter, \u201cHahahaha. I\u2019m sorry\u2013\u201dWasn\u2019t this the sentence that Brother Zhen used to scold Fu Mingxuan?! Help, his sister Yin is really tough!!!It wasn\u2019t only the laughter of Song Zhaolin that could be heard, but also the several suppressed \u201cpoofs\u201d in class.Fu Mingxuan fiercely looked back, then looked back. Chu Yin had already checked the list, and then he took the word book and went out to endorsement.Fu Mingxuan turned her head back and stared fiercely at her. Chu Yin had checked the system tasks on her list and went outside the classroom to review it again.The remaining people in class 5 looked at her retreating figure and was suddenly in a trance.What happened? She was still wearing the same baggy school uniform and mask, but how could she look so valiant?\u2026\u2026There is no one on the rooftop today. Chu Yin laid on the edge of the stage, memorizing a page of Level 6 words.\u2026\u2026Then she remembered the Shakespeare English week that Fu Mingxuan said.She had just been brought back from the countryside in her last life. Although her English was passable in the Middle School of the town, it could not be compared with the students trained by Huiwen elite education.She had just been adopted from the countryside in her previous life. Although her town\u2019s middle school was advance in English, it was incomparable with the students trained under the elite education of Huiwen.Since all the students in Huiwen recognized that the students under the international class had the highest level of English, they were responsible for drawing lots. In order for Chu Qiuqiu to humiliated Chu Yin, she drew Chu Yin\u2019s name from the black box when it came to the most difficult English excerpt.Gu Qiuze was present at that time and planned to help her recite.But it was snatched by Lu Zhen.From that day Lu Zhen helped her finish the hardest English excerpt, all the girls in school remembered Chu Yin\u2019s name and face.Since then, she had been called the school flower, and many students looked her for trouble.All thanks to that dog man.\u201cHost, your murderous aura is strong again.\u201dChu Yin sneered: \u201cWhere\u2019s my knife?\u201d\u201cThere is no knife, but I\u2019m sending the script to your head.\u201dA cold youthful voice sounded behind her, \u201cAre you okay?\u201dThe bloody pictures that Chu Yin had been imagining immediately stopped. There was a sense of tension as if she was exposed. She turned her head and suddenly\u2014The boy was dressed in a white shirt. His black hair pressed above his eyebrows and the tear mole at the corner of his eyes is very clear.Chu Yin held her arms high while she laid at the edge of the stage. When she turned around, her baggy school uniform accidentally moved the mask on her face, triggering it to slip down from the tip of her nose.When Lu Zhen saw the flash of her delicate and exquisite face, his heart was choked.Chu Yin quickly put on her mask.Lu Zhen regained his consciousness, turned his head, and took a breath before turning back again: \u201cI should apologize to you because of last time.\u201dChu Yin thought to herself\u2013Is this the male lead\u2019s halo? Why does this dog man always show up?She didn\u2019t want to communicate with him at all, and urged Xueji to load the script faster:\u3010Location: School Rooftop. Characters: Lu Zhen, Chu Yin.\u3011\u3010The wind in early autumn was very gentle. Their clothes swayed with the wind as they stood on the rooftop.Chu Yin did not respond to Lu Zhen\u2019s words.Lu Zhen looked at her for a moment and suddenly asked, \u201cWhy do you wear a mask?\u201dChu Yin lowered her head and still did not answer. She didn\u2019t want to talk to him.After a long time, Lu Zhen frowned and said, \u201cYou\u2013\u201c\u3011It was all dialogue for this short time. Chu Yin looked back and forth several times, but could not find a place to start.How could she end the conversation??Lu Zhen was looking at her side profile.Looking closely, he could see her delicate eyebrows frowning slightly, as if in deep thought.Was it difficult to talk to him?Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t say what he felt. He could turn around and leave, but he chose not to move.Even knowing that the other was not willing to talk, he still asked, \u201cWhy do you wear a mask?\u201dBecause of you, dog man!!!\u201cHost, do you want to use your permission?\u201d Xueji asked because Chu Yin didn\u2019t react for a long time.Just after it asked, Chu Yin suddenly had a flash of inspiration: She couldn\u2019t end the dialogue, but she could let the dog man finish it!!So she moved her light pen and crossed out Lu Zhen\u2019s \u3010\u201dYou\u2013\u201d\u3011sentence.And changed it to \u3010\u201dRoll.1\u201c\u3011Extremely skillful. She\u2019s a genius.Lu Zhen watched the subtle changes in her expression.He wanted to ask,\u00a0You\u2026Do you hate me?Then his lips opened slightly\u2026But at the moment he opened his mouth, he suddenly said, \u201cRoll.\u201dThe air was silent for a second.\u00a0 Lu Zhen was dumbfounded.This time, the girl in front of him finally reacted.She recoiled in surprise and hugged her book tightly: \u201cI\u2019m sorry! I\u2019m leaving now.\u201dAfter that, she turned and ran.This typhoon is awfully strong.Lu Zhen was silent again: \u201c\u2026.\u201dI did not. I really didn\u2019t.The author has something to say:Chu Yin\u2019s Diary: on X, x, x, year, Lu Zhen, that dog thief told me to go away.Lu Zhen: (swearing and quitting group chat)T/N: Just remembered that I wasn\u2019t able to upload a chapter in the first week of October! So here it is!\u00a0<3\u00a0Btw, I really appreciate the comments you guys been posting! I LOVE reading them!\u00a0Please comment more~>.<Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 \u2013 AuditoriumChu Yin was still laughing while she ran out.She completely assimilated the role of a concubine in the ancient empire. Thinking of what she did, she felt proud.\u201cHost, you\u2019re indeed a clever person!\u201d Xueji giggled, praising its host.Chu Yin ran to a safe place, leaned on the wall, lifted her mask, and breathed: \u201cOf course.\u201dBased on her understanding of Lu Zhen, he probably won\u2019t want to see her any time soon. After all, that man told her to go away. That young master is so proud that he would never take initiative to see her first.She\u2019s a far-sighted person, being able to kill two birds in one stone.Chu Yin took a deep breath and put on her mask again. As she walked back to the classroom, she asked Xueji: \u201cBy the way, what is the power of the male lead?\u201dXueji replied, \u201cThe power of the male lead is the ability to repair the broken plot that is supposed to favor the male lead. At this level, it affects the script generation of this system. Don\u2019t worry, this system is higher than the male lead\u2019s power.\u201dChu Yin pondered for a moment\u2013her golden finger couldn\u2019t face this male lead\u2019s halo directly. Could she be faster than him?Xueji said, \u201cIt can be understood that way.\u201dChu Yin was a little relieved.To avoid walking down the previous path of being the Male Lead\u2019s Bai Yuegang again, she could use the system\u2019s authority to tamper with her and Lu Zhen\u2019s opportunity to communicate to change their destiny.Even if she couldn\u2019t avoid the male lead\u2019s halo, she would still do her best.She didn\u2019t believe that Lu Zhen would like a well-behaved and dull bookworm.Shakespeare English Week is coming soon.Although Chu Yin didn\u2019t care much, the people in class 5 were still looking forward to it.These people attached great importance to all activities, even if it was a boring recitation.To wash away the humiliation, Fu Mingxuan prepared for a long time. She read Shakespeare\u2019s excerpts very smoothly with great emotion.On that day, the people from Class 5 went to the auditorium early. No one paid attention to Chu Yin.After several verbal conflicts, the social circle headed by Fu Mingxuan became more hostile to her. After Chu Yin\u2019s transcript records came out, everyone knew of Chu Yin\u2019s intelligence level. Most people in Class 5 thought she was not worthy to stay in their elite class.Even Song Zhaolin, who slept every day, had better English and Math scores than Chu Yin. Poor students like Chu Yin would lower their class\u2019 reputation.Song Zhaolin pickup up his coat and said to Chu Yin as he put it on, \u201cSister Yin, I\u2019m going to find Brother Zhen. Do you know the auditorium?\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dNow that everyone was gone, the class was quiet. She stayed to do a comprehensive essay.Just as she was thinking about this, the system in her brain gave a \u2018ding\u2019 sound.\u201cToday\u2019s task~ You can get permission to [change words] after completing the translation of Shakespeare\u2019s excerpts.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay.Then she had to go since the materials would only be distributed in the auditorium.Chu Yin stopped Song Zhaolin, who was about to leave: \u201cWait\u2013\u201cSong Zhaolin quickly turned back, feeling a little excited\u2013It was rare for Sister Yin to say something to him!He put his hands in trouser pockets while thinking that he was very handsome today. His voice lowered as he smoothly blinked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dChu Yin was silent for a moment, \u201cAre you going?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cMe and Brother Zhen won\u2019t be going.\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows slightly, \u201cOkay.\u201dSong Zhaolin was a little puzzled when he left. He couldn\u2019t tell whether Chu Yin was happy or unhappy.Also, she looks very beautiful. Why would she wear a mask?He couldn\u2019t feel her sense of presence at all and couldn\u2019t see her expression!\u2026When Chu Yin arrived in the auditorium, people had already sat down.The auditorium was the same as in the previous life. Chu Yin glanced at the podium, recalling the embarrassment of standing on it before.Now she\u2019s different.Chu Yin was about to find a spot in the back row when suddenly her cheek met with something icy. When she turned her head, she saw Gu Qiuze smiling while handing her a can of sweet milk.Before she was about to decline, Gu Qiuze whispered, \u201c Take it. I\u2019m just your brother\u2019s delivery guy.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t help but smile. She didn\u2019t refuse any more and took the can of milk.When he looked carefully, he could see the girl\u2019s beautiful peach eyes. When she smiled, it was like the surface of the lake shattered in beautiful waves. Such a pair of mesmerizing eyes clearly did not match her deliberately old fashioned uniform.Gu Qiuze looked at her without a trace and felt that the girl seemed to be hiding herself. However, out of politeness, he did not ask, but only gave a few words that Chu Shi asked him to pass on.Gu Qiuze looked at her without blinking, feeling that this girl was hiding her self. However, out of politeness, he didn\u2019t ask. He only said a few words that Chu Shi asked him to pass on.Many people in the auditorium looked at them.The students in Class 5 were more familiar with Chu Yin\u2019s figure. The girls all showed sour and unrestrained expressions when they saw Chu Yin and Gu Qiuze standing together and talking.Xing Lan, who was one of the top students, preferred the aura of Gu Qiuze compared to Lu Zhen, who was popular in the whole school.She squeezed the pen in her hand as she said, \u201cThe \u2018top\u2019 student in our class is powerful. She can hook up with anyone!\u201dThe girl on the side also mocked and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you see it? Although some people don\u2019t look good, their methods are good.\u201d\u201cNo wonder she\u2019s not good at studying. Her mind is spent on men!\u201dChu Qiuqiu in the distance naturally saw that scene. She even saw Gu Qiuze give Chu Yin a can of milk, and her expression was a little distorted for a moment.Brother recently ignored her. How could he and Gu Qiuze favor Chu Yin?!Why that country bumpkin?!Chu Qiuqiu felt sour in her heart. She lowered her head and looked at the lottery box she had prepared in her hand when she suddenly had a flash of inspiration.Didn\u2019t Chu Yin like to show off? I\u2019ll give her a chance~When the activity was about to start, the back door of the auditorium was suddenly opened.The crowd suddenly began to buzz.\u201cBrother Zhen!\u201d\u201cIs Lu Zhen taking part in this activity?\u201d\u201cAh, ah, fortunately, I\u2019m here.\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t bother to look back. She talked to Gu Qiuze before she turned and sat down in the corner.Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze swept over her subconsciously. His expression was cold, his eyes were dark, but the brown-red mole in the corner of his eyes was vivid.Many girls dared not breathe when he glanced in their direction.Chu Yin didn\u2019t pay attention to him at all. She picked up the materials on the desk and began to do her translation task.Lu Zhen retracted his gaze, his heart feeling a bit of irritability.The last time Lu Zhen was quiet was when he scolded him.Song Zhaolin had just looked at Chu Yin and saw that she was sitting far away. While at this, he found Brother Zhen\u2019s gaze was on Chu Yin.He thought about it carefully and felt that Lu Zhen was not happy at this time.So he whispered, \u201cBrother Zhen, do you hate my deskmate?\u201dLu Zhen turned his face slightly\u2013his eyes and the bridge of his nose outlined a cold and sharp line. His voice was weak and light as he said, \u201cShe\u2019s your deskmate?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Song Zhaolin said naively, \u201cIt\u2019s been more than a month.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips slightly pursed, and after a while, he suddenly asked, \u201cHow is your relationship?\u201dSong Zhaolin habitually began to brag, \u201cGood. Ah! I think she likes me! Today, she cared whether I will come to participate or not.\u201dLu Zhen rubbed his knuckles with his fingers and looked down, \u201cOh\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t know if it was his illusion or not but he felt that Brother Zhen became even more unhappy.The event officially began. It was hosted by the second year international class and Chu Qiuqiu was in charge of drawing lots.People selected from the large lottery box would have to recite Shakespeare\u2019s piece. Although most of the students in Huiwen are good at English, there still gaps in pronunciation and vocabulary.Fu Mingxuan almost broke her neck from waiting, but Chu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t seem to see her. She knew that Fu Mingxuan must be well prepared. How could she give her a chance to perform?After everyone recited, the English teacher who sat below the podium would give out comments and pick out some mistakes. Naturally, the students would turn red after being pointed out their mistakes in front of these many people.Chu Qiuqiu was very satisfied with this.Her eyes swept to Chu Yin in the back corner and saw that she was looking for something on her mobile phone with her head down. Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s smile was even more proud.Chu Yin probably couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying. She must be busy looking up the words.Chu Qiuqiu held the small note in her hand and smiled with confidence.There would be the longest and most difficult excerpt later. It had seven or eight words in a line. Chu Qiuqiu would definitely leave the best for her sister.\u201cDing\u2013Translating paragraph selection task completed \u221a , received [change word] permission. Host, you\u2019re a great translator!\u201dChu Yin put down her pen and rubbed her wrist.There were a few new words in this excerpt that she didn\u2019t know much about so she had to check a little bit, but overall it was not difficult for her.\u201cDo you want to load the script?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cLoad.\u201dShe wanted to see what Chu Qiuqiu was planning at this time.Sure enough, her fake sister didn\u2019t let her down\u2014\u2014\u3010Chu Qiuqiu took a moment while drawing the lots before she took out a small note. Her face showed a complex expression of surprise and worry as she said out loud, \u201cI\u2019ve chosen Chu Yin!\u201d\u3011Just like in the previous life, Chu Qiuqiu picked the hardest part of the selection to make Chu Yin make a fool of herself in front of the whole class.The only difference was that she won\u2019t let herself be embarrassed anymore, nor would she let Lu Zhen help her and be an enemy of the school.Xueji asked, \u201cHost, do you want to read it yourself?\u201dAfter reading Chu Yin\u2019s translation, he knew that the host could read it.Chu Yin hooked her lips: \u201cNo.\u201dShe moved the light pen, and without hesitation, crossed out the word \u201cChu Yin\u201d and changed it into \u201cMyself\u201d.\u2014\u2014In front of all these people, I won\u2019t let this opportunity slip byOn the stage, Chu Qiuqiu pretended to take out the small note in the palm of her hand, then opened her mouth and said in a sonorous and powerful voice: \u201cI\u2019ve chosen myself!\u201dAfter speaking, she was dumbfounded for two seconds, then her face suddenly turned pale.How did it become her??\u2014\u2014She, she, she could not read this paragraph!Chu Yin looked at her embarrassed appearance, leaned back on the chair, and poked the system: \u201cDo you have songs for service?\u201dXueji happily enjoyed the scene as it asked, \u201cWhat song do you want?\u201dChu Yin smiled eerily. Picked the song~\u00a0How lonely is being invincible\u00a01~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11 \u2013 Took the examChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face turned green as she stuttered on the stage for five minutes before she finished reading.The English teacher expressed kindly that although she did not read well, she could see that the drawing lot was transparent! Otherwise, how could the person who was drawing the lot pick herself?Chu Qiuqiu reluctantly agreed with the teacher.Among the audience, Fu Mingxuan and friends couldn\u2019t hold back their laughter. Chu Qiuqiu usually was fond of showing off, but this time she was humiliated in front of the whole grade!Chu Qiuqiu was confused even until the end of the activity. How could the note she wrote with Chu Yin\u2019s name suddenly become her name? And even if she picked herself, she could pretend that she picked a blank piece of paper!After she down from the podium, several classmates from international classes came together to comfort her.\u201cYou did good, Qiuqiu! Your pronunciation is super authentic.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Qiuqiu. Everyone knows that your English is very good.\u201d\u201cThe mid-term exam is coming. You can prove yourself with your grades~\u201dUnder their comfort, Chu Qiuqiu felt comfortable again \u2013 yes, the exam was coming soon.They were all from the Liberal Arts Department. They would have to compete with each other in the midterm exam. Even if her country bumpkin sister could avoid this time, she couldn\u2019t avoid the exam. As soon as the results come out, she would want to see her sister\u2019s face!When that time comes, her father, mother, brother, Gu Qiuze, and the whole school would know who was the better daughter of the Chu family.Chu Yin studied harder these days.She was also looking forward to the mid-term exam because\u2014\u2014\u201cDing \u2013 release the first large-scale learning task ~. In the mid-term examination, the first grade and four stars in the difficulty coefficient can be obtained. \u201c\u201cDing \u2013 a four stars difficult task has been unlocked ~ Rank first in the mid-term exam and get permission to change a single sentence.\u201d\u2014\u2014Sentence!!Although she could only change a word in the script and had achieved good results due to her artistic talent, her authority was too low resulting in her talent being ultimately constrained.But this time she could change the whole sentence!\u201cHost, you\u2019re excited~\u201dCan you not get excited?As a person who lost her freedom in her last life, God knows just how sweet this feeling of having power and control.So, in the following week, Chu Yin simply learned to forget to eat and sleep.She had already memorized the notes for literature and comprehensive studies before reviewing it again. All the existing papers in her hand had all been corrected. She also rewrote the CET-6 words. The composition materials alone accumulated more than ten pages.As the exam was approaching, everyone in Class 5 took it seriously. Even Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t dare to sleep in class for fear of missing the exam points.Being an elite class, they had always attached great importance to performance. After each test, their top priority was the posting of results for each subject. Everyone paid special attention to who received the highest score in the test\u2013whether it was the highest score in the whole grade or the difference of the score of each person.In the increasingly tense atmosphere of preparing for the exam, ridiculing Chu Yin became their daily coping mechanism.Fu Mingxuan was a Bai Fumei\u00a01\u00a0 and the class flower\u00a02\u00a0in their class. She took the lead in excluding Chu Yin. This kind of environment formed imperceptibly in the class, except for Song Zhaolin, who was a nice person. He was the only one who talked to Chu Yin when no one else paid attention to her.Several boys who liked Fu Mingxuan laughed and joked, \u201cToday, the \u2018top student\u2019 is busy studying that she forgot to use the toilet.\u201dXing Lan said: \u201cI guess I\u2019m used to her behavior. Are there no toilets in rural schools?\u201d\u201cHa ha ha, it\u2019s possible!\u201dDespite the class being noisy during the class break, it did not affect the speed of Chu Yin\u2019s writing.Fu Mingxuan looked back at her and sneered: \u201cBasing from her previous records, it\u2019s useless to work hard.\u201d\u201cMaybe she isn\u2019t working hard, but trying to show off. How can a person be immersed in learning still have time to hook up with men? Have you forgotten that she deliberately attracted the attention of Brother Zhen and Senior Gu Qiuze?\u201dThe girls showed nauseatic expressions one after another.The boys were shocked when they heard it for the first time.\u201cFuck, what else?\u201d\u201cIf I were Lu Zhen or Gu Qiuze, I would be disgusted to death.\u201d\u201cAh, I hope that Chu Yin\u2019s score will be counted separately, otherwise the class\u2019s average score will be lowered. How can we win against Class 1 if this happens\u2026\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t listen to the gossip of the class. Every day, she overfulfilled her study plan and reviewed it seriously.Because she stayed in the classroom all day and left immediately after school, she didn\u2019t meet Lu Zhen for a while.The day before the exam, the school posted a seating plan for the exam date.The seating plan was based according to the final scores of last semester. Fu Mingxuan, Xing Lan, and Chu Qiuqiu were all in the first examination room. Chu Yin had no grades yet so she was placed in the last examination room.She glanced around and saw Lu Zhen\u2019s name in the examination room.His seat was behind her.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin said beside her, \u201cSister Yin, your seat is the best choice.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face was expressionless: Fuck your best choice.However, she changed her mind and thought that Lu Zhen never took these grade exams. He had no grades like her and was placed in the last examination room.In her previous high school life, Chu Yin thought he was a bad student who didn\u2019t study. Later, she realized that he had been receiving elite education arranged by his family.As long as that dog man won\u2019t come to affect her exam, everything would go easy.In the evening, Lu Zhen and his friends came out for dinner.Song Zhaolin and Tan Ke were not polite and ordered a big table of foods.In the process of being served by the headwaiter, Song Zhaolin asked Lu Zhen: \u201cBy the way, Brother Zhen, will you go to the exam tomorrow?\u201dTan Ke laughed: \u201cWhen did Brother Zhen ever go?\u201dSong Zhaolin nodded: \u201cRight.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s expression was nonchalant as his long slender fingers turned the glass, \u201cWhat did you ask for?\u201dWhen all the dishes were placed on the table, Song Zhaolin said vaguely as he ate, \u201cMy deskmate is arranged to sit in front of you. I thought you hated her. You might get angry if you go.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s fingers suddenly stopped.Tan Ke didn\u2019t know this person yet and stared, \u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cChu Yin,\u201d Song Zhaolin said, \u201cThe Chu family took that daughter back.\u201dThey were all in the wealthy circle. Of course, Tan Ke knew about it. The girl got scolded in the forum because of her transcript records.But other than that, the was nothing attractive about this daughter of the Chu family. She was neither excellent nor beautiful. Tan Ke changed the subject after mentioning her for a second.Lu Zhen slightly lowered his eyes, his dark pupils looked at the edge of the glass. No one could read the meaning of his expression.After a long time, he suddenly said, \u201cI hate her?\u201dSong Zhaolin and Tan Ke did not keep up: \u201cAh?\u201dLu Zhen threw the glass and gave a low smile.It\u2019s the opposite.On the morning of the next day, Chu Qiuqiu read the books in the car. Class 5 was very quiet at this time, and even Song Zhaolin was paying close to the key points of the subjects.But this day, Chu Yin was already relaxed.Near eight o\u2019clock, people in the classroom went to their examination room. When Chu Yin walked into the penultimate examination room, several girls stretched their necks in anticipation, and then hung back in disappointment.The students went to their respective examination room after the clock nearly reached eight o\u2019clock. Several girls stretched their necks in anticipation, but when they saw Chu Yin walking into the room, they hung back in disappointment.Chu Yin glanced and saw Lu Zhen didn\u2019t come. Very good \u221aHer front and back seats were empty, with only two girls sitting on both her left and right sides. Because Huiwen is rich, even for this kind of mid-term examination, they put a signal screening device and strict checks on mobile phones. The girls on both sides were so bored that they almost cried during the exam. They leaned on the papers to doodle to pass the time.Chu Yin was no affected by their behavior. She answered the exam very steadily in the morning.By the afternoon of the math exam, the girls in the classroom had lost all hope and were no longer looking forward to it. Their heads laid on the table boredly, waiting for the test papers to come.When the teacher came in with the sealed paper, the back door was suddenly opened.There was a commotion in the classroom.After a few seconds, Chu Yin felt a gust of air behind her\u2013a clear and pleasant smell.Her body-memory immediately reminded her that this was Lu Zhen\u2019s scent.The girls on both sides immediately sat up, adjusted their posture, arranged their hair, and were full of excitement.The boy was tall, and after sitting down, there was no space to put his long legs. He looked at the person in front and noticed her stiffness and anxiety.Because of the close distance, Lu Zhen could see the porcelain white back of her neck that was exposed because of her ponytail. Few strands of hair fell on her delicate soft neck.Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t help but get closer: \u201cPass the papers, classmate.\u201dChu Yin scolded him in her heart, but on the surface, she had to pass the papers properly.As soon as she turned around, Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze fell on her face.The girl\u2019s eyelashes fluttered down, like a row of crow feathers. Her skin was tender and soft, and he could see the light blue blood vessels on her eyelids.Chu Yin quickly turned back.Dog man looked at me!The math scores for the liberal arts students had the most effect on the scores and could widen the differences in the average score.She must get the best score to get the best results.After finishing the first twelve choices, Chu Yin took a deep breath with an expression of wanting to kill and told the system, \u201cLoad the current script.\u201d\u2026Lu Zhen, that dog! Yes! Look!Look at me again, I\u2019ll kill you!Sure enough, the male lead\u2019s halo was to counter her golden finger, preventing her from getting higher authority!!Although Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t hear her voice, he could feel her indistinct agitation.Bookworms could get irritated like this, too?Just because she couldn\u2019t solve the problem?She seemed to be poor in her studies.Chu Yin immediately browsed the script:\u3010Lu Zhen was not answering his test papers. He was sitting in the examination room for two hours with one hand on his cheek.\u3011\u201cCan I blind the man?\u201dXueji: \u201cWhat?\u201dChu Yin was ready to move her light pen:\u00a0 Change \u201csitting\u201d to \u201cblind\u201dXueji: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to hurt him, host.\u201dBut a few seconds later, Chu Yin still crossed the word.She changed \u201csitting\u201d to \u201csleeping\u201dLet\u2019s see if you can still look at me!!After this, she couldn\u2019t feel his gaze anymore.The young man put his arms on the table and closed his eyes. The tear mole at the corner of his eyes was hidden safely in his eyelashes. His face exuded elegance.The thoughts of all girls in the classroom were all about him.Chu Yin finally finished the test paper thoroughly and smoothly. There were still ten minutes left after she reviewed her answers.Lu Zhen woke up.She smiled, handed in the papers, and left the scene unhurriedly.\u2014\u2014See you again!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12 \u2013 First in the gradeAfter Chu Yin walked out of the examination room, she met Chu Qiuqiu and her best friends outside the school gate.Those who could appear on campus at this time were either top students who handed their papers earlier or poor students who randomly answered the questions quickly.When Chu Qiuqiu saw Chu Yin, she took her for the latter.Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s friends lamented, \u201cIt\u2019s finished. Math is too difficult. What about you, Qiuqiu?\u201dChu Qiuqiu glanced at Chu Yin and said with a smile, \u201cI think it\u2019s okay? It\u2019s not very difficult.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re amazing! Qiuqiu, the final question, were you able to answer it?\u201dChu Qiuqiu flipped her hair and implicitly said, \u201cThe x I calculated is equal to three-quarter of the root.\u201d\u201cMy God, you\u2019ve worked it out!\u201d\u201cI think you\u2019re not just going to score more than 104 points this time at math, but you might get the full score!\u201dChu Yin passed by them without expression.What the hell is three-quarter of the root?The answer is X = 1.After returning home, the Chu parents happened to be at home. They learned that their two daughters took the midterm exam very seriously.Mother Chu asked with concern, \u201cHow was the exam today? Can Qiuqiu keep the ranking?\u201dChu Qiuqiu coquettishly said, \u201cMom, I have been seriously reviewing until midnight these days, and my efforts will be rewarded.\u201dFather Chu nodded with satisfaction: \u201cHeaven rewards diligence. You\u2019re worthy of being the daughter of our Chu family.\u201dAlthough they all knew that Qiuqiu was an adopted daughter, this adopted daughter was very competitive, which proved that their original vision was not wrong.Chu Yin indifferently looked at the scene of Father Chu\u2019s kindness and filial piety, while Chu Shi who sat beside her frowned slightly.After the Chu parents praised their adopted daughter, they felt embarrassed when they looked at their biological daughter because they hadn\u2019t gotten close to her plus her achievements were too poor.Mother Chu politely asked, \u201cHow does Xiaoyin feel? Are the questions of Huiwen more difficult than your previous school?\u201dChu Yin swallowed the food in her mouth and objectively replied, \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dShe was already at the university level and had studied abroad. The knowledge that Lu Zhen forced her to learn together was much more difficult than that of domestic high schools. This exam was just an ordinary mid-term in the second year of high school, and it was less difficult for Chu Yin.Mother Chu said, \u201cI will enroll you in some remedial classes after you pass each subject.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin nodded.Chu Qiuqiu listened to these, her eyebrows scrunched up \u2013 her parent\u2019s treatment of her who was excellent and her sister who was senseless are not the same!Sure enough, her parents have higher hopes for her!In the evening, Chu Yin memorized the key points of the three subjects of history, geography, and politics. She didn\u2019t worry about English. She had a strong foundation so she didn\u2019t need to review it. She just needed to be careful in the exam.After she washed and was preparing to go to bed, there was a gentle knock coming from her door.As soon as the door opened, her brother stood outside: \u201cHaven\u2019t you slept yet?\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cGoing to sleep now.\u201dChu Shi touched her head: \u201cDon\u2019t take the exam seriously. You can do whatever you want.\u201dAlthough her brother was very warm-hearted, he also thought that she would do a bad job in the exam. Chu Yin was a little puzzled: \u201cOkay, I will try my best.\u201dChu Shi also laughed: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll find a bright student to bless you.\u201dThe next day, Chu Yin was helpless when he saw Gu Qiuze outside the examination room.It seemed that some things would not change. In the last life, his brother acted like a cupid for her and Gu Qiuze. This life was still the same.The senior leaned against the wall. He was clean and handsome, and the girls who passed by flushed red at his presence.Chu Yin stopped in front of him. Gu Qiuze raised his fingertip and pressed on her forehead: \u201cBlessing has come.\u201dChu Yin smiled, \u201cThank you very much.\u201dGu Qiuze was stunned before he laughed. \u201cGo and attend your exam now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Chu Yin turned the corner with her schoolbag on her back, she saw Lu Zhen.\u2014\u2014He stood at the door of the classroom, grimly looking at her.Huh, the dog man is in a bad mood?Chu Yin thought of what she had done to him yesterday, for a second, she felt guilty, but then she became confident again. It would be nice not to let him feel the world of the blind. Lu Zhen still dared to stare at her!She didn\u2019t look down. She didn\u2019t look down.She lowered her eyes, pretended not to see as she bowed her head and walked into the classroom.Lu Zhen simply laughed.Afraid of him?She talks and laughs with others, but when she sees him, she acts as if she hadn\u2019t seen him.After growing up as the young master of the Lu family, this was the first time he felt so unwelcome.By a little bookworm.\u201cChu Yin.\u201dLu Zhen called her name for the first time.Chu Yin paused, her ears itched physiologically.\u201cI won\u2019t go in today. You take the exam.\u201d Lu Zhen looked down at her as his voice lowered. \u201cI\u2026I\u2019m not dangerous.\u201dChu Yin finally raised her eyes.Her glass-like pupil was moist and clear and her thick eyelashes above her eyes were hazy that reflected her soft beauty.This was the first time she looked at him firmly, neither hiding nor avoiding.Lu Zhen held his breath subconsciously.A few seconds later, he slowly exhaled and turned away: \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201dHis heartbeat was wild as he left in a hurry.Chu Yin looked back inexplicably.\u201cDo you know what\u2019s written in my eyes?\u201d She said to Xueji\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2018I\u2019 is written in my left eye, and \u2018live\u2019 is written in my right eye.\u201d1\u2014\u2014I won\u2019t have any evil intentions if this dog man doesn\u2019t exist\u2026\u2026The day\u2019s exam ended smoothly.The questions of the three subjects were all in the range of Chu Yin\u2019s scope. English was relatively simple for her. Chu Yin could answer the questions very smoothly.Huiwen\u2019s students took a weekend off after the exams. When Monday arrived, it ushered in the long-awaited results.Class 5 students were very nervous. Students were rushing to the teacher\u2019s office to ask for the ranking results.Unfortunately, the grading efficiency of Huiwen was not good. Since the rankings were yet to be posted, everyone in the class was too anxious to study. Although Chu Yin was also looking forward to the results, she was much calmer than them.The first section of the afternoon was English. We all know that machine-readable English is the fastest. As soon as the English teacher enters the classroom, several boys call on him.The first part of the afternoon was English. Everyone knew that English was the fastest subject the machine could check. When the English teacher entered the classroom, a few boys called, \u201cTeacher, it\u2019s time to announce the English results!\u201dThe English teacher held the paper, glanced at the whole class, and said with a smile, \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the topic first!\u201dIn this case, Class 5 did well in the English exam.Xing Lan poked Fu Mingxuan and frowned: \u201cXuanxuan, I think you\u2019re in the top for this subject.\u201dFu Mingxuan was the best English student in her class. She could get 104 each time.She hooked her lips and guessed that she could outrank Chu Qiuqiu this time.As the teacher talked about the questions and the correct answers were announced for each, the students in Class 5 either cheered or wailed.Next to Chu Yin, Song Zhaolin was wailing almost all the time.His body and mind suffered a huge blow. He couldn\u2019t help looking over his head \u2013 Sister Yin was holding her cheek in one hand and turning the red pen in the other hand. She looked relaxed.He understood.There were so many mistakes that she was too lazy to change them.It\u2019s the same with him, TATAfter the discussion finished, Chu Yin finally put down her pen.All right.Now that the results could be roughly estimated, the class was very noisy. All the students in Class 5 look at Fu Mingxuan, the best English student, and asked, \u201cHow did you do, Xuanxuan?\u201dFu Mingxuan spread out her paper, with pride in her eyes: \u201cI made two mistakes.\u201dNo one in the class could do these two questions correctly. The listening test was based on American slang. People who had not visited abroad would have no understanding of it.\u2014\u2014Other than that, her English-reading section was all right!\u201cDamn, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d\u201cXuanxuan, you are a great god.\u201d\u201cThen you are the best in class?\u201dFu Mingxuan did very well. She was smiling all over her face. When she turned back to talk to people, she caught a glimpse of Chu Yin. She was lowering her head, her face was blocked by her bangs and mask. She had no sense of existence as usual.Did you hear that, Country Bumpkin? Now it\u2019s time for her to know the achievement level of their elite class.On the first day of school, Chu Qiuqiu said that Chu Yin couldn\u2019t understand English. How many points could she get? 50? In any case, she would lower the average score of their class.The boys began to cry: \u201cTeacher, we already discussed the questions, you quickly say the results!\u201dThe English teacher\u2019s face was full of smiles as her eyes swept across the corner by the window.The result was really beyond her expectation, but what surprised her most was that student.She had seen it many times before. When other students bought milk tea and chatted between class breaks, she was the only student who was still studying silently in her seat.Originally, she thought that the gap in educational resources would lead to her weak English foundation, but the child unexpectedly gave her a big surprise!\u201cFirst of all, Congratulations, the English test results are very good!\u201d\u201cIs the top 1 for the whole grade in our class?\u201dThe English teacher nodded: \u201cYes!\u201dAll of a sudden, the crowd turned to Fu Mingxuan.Fu Mingxuan straightened her back with a smile. She outranked Chu Qiuqiu in English!But the teacher\u2019s next sentence left the whole class shocked\u2014\u2014\u201cThe top 1 in the class achieved a perfect score in the whole grade!\u201d\u201c-What?\u201dJust now Fu Mingxuan said that she had two wrong questions. Who got the perfect score?!At this time, Chu Yin\u2019s brain sounded a crisp and cheerful electronic sound\u2014\u2014\u201cDing \u2013 First achievement in English subject \u221a grade one task completion 15% ~! Host, success is one step closer.\u201dChu Yin leaned on the back of the chair with a peaceful face.Fu Mingxuan\u2019s face was very stiff. Was it Jiang Yan? If not, who? Who else in the class was better than her in English?However, the English teacher\u2019s excited eyes fell on the corner by the window.\u201cThe one who scored the perfect score is the transfer student, Chu Yin! Everyone applause!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13 \u2013 First RankChu Yin?! Perfect score?!!Because of the shock, no one in the class applauded at all, only the clapping sound of the English teacher could be heard.\u201cAs we all know, Chu Yin came from a provincial middle school, and her foundation in English is no better than everyone\u2013But! This only proves that inferior educational resources can\u2019t rival the fruits of hard work! I often saw Chu Yin studying quietly in her seat while everyone played during class breaks.\u201dNo one listened to what the English teacher was saying.Class 5 was hit by a huge impact.Chu Yin felt a little shame in her heart.Educational resources were indeed unbalanced. After all, she went abroad to study in her previous life.I\u2019m sorry.The class ended with great praise of Chu Yin from the English teacher. Class 5 blew up after the teacher left.\u201cHow is it possible? You\u2019ve seen her previous transcripts. How many points did she have in English? Didn\u2019t she failed it?\u201d\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t believe she can get a perfect score in English. Is she making a joke?\u201dThe most affected of this all was Fu Mingxuan. Her English had always been the subject she was most proud of. She already performed very well this time, thus everyone was congratulating her just now. Who knew that someone beat her with a perfect score\u2013And it was the country bumpkin who just transferred?!Everyone was thinking\u2013 How did Chu Yin take the test? They never voiced their opinions.Fu Mingxuan pushed aside the paper and sneered: \u201cif you have the ability, copy it first.\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t listen to the various whispers in the class because in her mind Xueji gave a prompt:\u201cDing\u2013You\u2019ve been granted the permission of [change a word] for successfully placing first in a single subject. It has been delivered to the host account~\u201dChu Yin was satisfied. She didn\u2019t expect that there would be additional rewards.She\u2019ll use it later.It took Song Zhaolin a long time to recover from the sadness of \u2018I thought you were in the same boat with me, who knows you left me and even soared into the sky\u2019.He looked at Chu Yin bitterly and sorrowfully said, \u201cSister Yin, your English is so good.\u201dSeeing his hidden bitterness with a mixture of melancholy, Chu Yin wanted to laugh, \u201cDid I say I\u2019m not good?\u201dSong Zhaolin was dumbfounded and then said, \u201cHuh?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s poor learning, Chu Yin pretended to be a top student, Chu Yin\u2019s inability to understand English\u2026All these rumors that others spoke were not confirmed at all!Song Zhaolin suddenly had a terrible premonition, \u201cThen will you do well in other subjects\u2026\u201dChu Yin laughed, \u201cI don\u2019t know yet.\u201dThe next part was Chinese.The Chinese teacher didn\u2019t discuss the topic and directly issued everyone\u2019s test papers.\u201cJiang Yan Chinese 138!\u201d Someone exclaimed.With the experience of the last class, the students asked in advance: \u201cTeacher, is 138 the highest score?\u201dChinese teacher smiled: \u201cYes. It\u2019s also the first in all the grades. Very good!\u201dThere was a sense of relief.Xing Lan\u2019s score was 128. She poked Fu Mingxuan: \u201cHow about you?\u201dFu Mingxuan was 132, also very high.She turned around and looked. When she saw Chu Yin lowered her head unhappily, she immediately smiled. The frustrations in her heart dissipated a lot.Chu Yin looked at her Chinese paper, 135. Well, it\u2019s within her estimation.The Chinese class was over after giving out the papers.\u00a0 This time, the atmosphere was much more relaxed. While everyone gathered together to talk about their scores, they unintentionally glanced at Chu Yin.The last one was the History class. The History teacher brought the results of both the subjects of literature and comprehensive study together.After the test papers were sent out, the teacher looked at the expectant eyes of the Class 5 students. He simply told them the results of the three subjects:\u201cThe highest score in History is 95! Politics\u2026Let me think about it\u2026Teacher Song said that your class\u2019s highest score is 98. The Geography is 94. Yes! You all did well in the exam!\u201dEvery time he announced the highest scores per subject, there were cheers from the class.\u201cI am the highest in History!\u201d\u201cGeography is me, hahaha!\u201d\u201cWow! Politics is me!\u201dNone of them was from Chu Yin.Class 5 was completely relieved this time.No one could cheat in Chinese since it has densely written essays and characters. Wasn\u2019t she showing her true colors? She could only take advantage of English!Fu Mingxuan\u2019s heart was also at ease. She had the highest score in History, while her scores in the other two subjects were not bad. She guessed she would rank in the top three in the class. Counting English\u2026As long as she could perform well in math, she would be the first in the class this time!The History teacher gave an interesting lecture. The atmosphere was very good throughout the class. It was not until the class was over that some students remembered to ask him:\u201cSo, Teacher Liu, who ranked first in comprehensive?\u201d\u201cWell? Didn\u2019t I mention it?\u201d The history teacher chuckled, \u201cA classmate in your class ranked second in the three subjects of History, Geography, and Politics. The comprehensive score is more than ten points higher than the second-ranking.\u201d\u201cWho??!\u201dThe History teacher\u2019s eyes glanced around the class, \u201cI also want to recognize this classmate\u2019s face\u2013where is Chu Yin sitting?\u201dAs soon as his voice dropped, the whole class was in an uproar!Everyone turned their heads collectively, their necks almost broke.Chu Yin calmly put away the papers, raised her hand, and said placidly, \u201cHere.\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s premonition came true. He was so touched that he covered his chest while shedding happy tears.After the teacher went out, the class was surprisingly quiet.The subject of Mathematics was the only one left. Originally, everyone was looking forward to it, but now they suddenly felt fear.What if\u2026the country bumpkin they always looked down upon was really a school top student? Judging from her current scores, her English and Literature were excellent. If her Mathematics was not too bad\u2026Fu Mingxuan\u2019s mentality was about to collapse.She calculated in her heart, at present, Chu Yin was at least 20 points higher than her, 20 points!! How could this be possible?!Fu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t hold back this kind of suffocation, and could not admit the fact in any case. So when she looked back at Chu Yin again and found that she folded something secretly and put it in her schoolbag, the whole person was shocked.Fu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t hold back her breath. She couldn\u2019t admit this fact anyway. When she looked back at Chu Yin again and found that she had secretly folded something and stuffed it into her schoolbag, she became excited.She ran over with blood pumping in her veins as she grabbed Chu Yin\u2019s bag, \u201cDid you cheat?!\u201dChu Yin guessed that she would be doubted, but didn\u2019t expect it so suddenly.As she told the system to load the script, she pulled back her bag: \u201cHands off.\u201dWhen the class heard the bickering, they focused their eyes on them.Chu Yin browsed the script:\u3010Fu Mingxuan didn\u2019t let go. She turned her head and told the class in a loud voice, \u201cI just saw\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 what she secretly hid!\u201dAs soon as the students heard, they showed a suspicious look.Fu Mingxuan continued to press Chu Yin: \u201cYour grades are not normal. Did you prepare a cheat sheet? Let me look through the bag!\u201d\u3011Who would keep the cheat sheet until now?? Chu Yin wanted to applaud this mentally retarded plot.Fu Mingxuan was aggressive at once: \u201c\u2013You admit it!\u201dChu Yin sneered, \u201cAre you sick in your brain?\u201dWhat Chu Yin folded up was a page of notes, which recorded the key points of the comprehensive exam. Originally, It didn\u2019t matter if it was taken out. It would take some words to explain at most, but Chu Yin changed her mind at this moment.\u2014\u2014She decided to personally highlight Fu Mingxuan\u2019s sick brain once and for all.\u3010Fu Mingxuan grabbed her bag, took out an origami from it, and said aloud, \u201cLook! This is it\u2026the cheat sheet!\u3011\u2191Chu Yin moved the light pen and changed one of the words in this paragraph.Therefore, Fu Mingxuan snatched her schoolbag, opened it recklessly, and rummaged inside.Everyone stared at her scorchingly.A few seconds later, Fu Mingxuan took out a pancake from her schoolbag.\u201cLook! This is it\u2013\u201dEveryone: \u201c???\u201dWasn\u2019t this just a fucking big pancake?This time, the suspicious eyes shifted to Fu Mingxuan. This situation was like a farce Fu Mingxuan directed and acted under jealousy.Chu Yin took the pancake back and said sincerely, \u201cIf you are sick, go and treat it.\u201dFu Mingxuan turned blue.As her boiling blood calmed down, she saw the eyes of her classmates, and suddenly realized how out of line her behavior was.Fu Mingxuan\u2019s lips stammered twice. Just as she was trying to explain, the math teacher came with the paper in her arms.At this point, the eyes of the whole class were almost frightened.\u201cWhy do you have this expression? You did very well on the exam!\u201d\u201cIn particular, one of your classmates made a big change\u2013\u201cFu Mingxuan, as well as all the students in class 5, felt a sense of foreboding.The last word they want to hear now was a change!But at the next moment, the voice of the math teacher sounded: \u201cChu Yin, perfect score in Math! Very good!!\u201dFu Mingxuan was hit hard.There\u2019s only one thought in her mind: her number one ranking is gone, it\u2019s gone\u2026Fu Mingxuan\u2019s mentality finally collapsed completely. After a few seconds, she ran out of the classroom crying.\u2026\u2026\u201cI saw Fu Mingxuan running out crying just now. I think she failed the exam.\u201d A girl from the international class returned to her seat and said to Chu Qiuqiu with a smile.Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was surprised, but her heart was filled with joy.Today, she did well in every subject. Her Mathematics and English were more than 104. Not only could she maintain her grade ranking, but she also guessed she would be promoted a few ranks higher. Her parents would be very satisfied.How high could Chu Yin get? When the ranking gets out, Chu Yin had to look at them. Let\u2019s show them to our parents and make a sharp contrast~She didn\u2019t wait long when someone ran in the corridor shouting, \u201cThe ranking list is finally posted!\u201dThe students of the international class quickly open the online site and logged in to the account to check the score list.\u201cQuick, Qiuqiu, check your rank. Are you in the top five of the whole grade this time?\u201d Several friends urged.\u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll go and take a look.\u201dEveryone stares at the projector screen. As the roller slides upward, Chu Qiuqiu seems to see a familiar name.Rolling stopped, grade ranking remained in the top ten, Chu Qiuqiu ranked seventh, with a total score of 661.\u201cThe score is so high, Qiuqiu!\u201d\u201c7th rank is so good! Oh, if I can get this score, my father will be very happy!\u201dBefore they could say more, their attention was suddenly attracted by others\u2013Someone said in surprise: \u201cDamn! who is the 1st rank? Is it a monster?\u201d\u201cThe total score is 713?! The second place is only 702! \u201c\u201cWhich class? Class five? \u201cAfter a few seconds of silence, a bigger roar broke out on the platform: \u201cFirst place, Chu Yin?\u201dIn the corner of the classroom, Lu Zhen, who bowed his head to play with his mobile phone, suddenly raised his head.\u201cFuck! This is not the ranking list\u2026\u201d\u201cYes! Isn\u2019t she a terrible student?\u201dTan Ke also raised his head. He carefully looked at the name of the person who ranked first and said, \u201cMy God, Lin Zi, his deskmate is actually a hidden jewel.\u201dLu Zhen slightly raised his chin and looked at the ranking list. After a long time, he laughed.Tan Ke: \u201cBrother Zhen, what are you laughing at?\u201dLu Zhen shook his head with a smile.The little bookworm is a good student.So\u2026she hated him because he was a bad student who didn\u2019t take the exam?Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was pale. She was stunned by the news and stood up with disbelief on her face.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Qiu Qiu?\u201d\u201cMy sister\u2026she studies very poorly in the town. She can\u2019t get such a high score!\u201dIndeed, who hadn\u2019t seen her transcript?\u201cYou mean, did she\u2026\u201d\u201cDamn, do you think she cheated?\u201dChu Qiuqiu calmed down and said, \u201cif she does something like this, for the fairness of the whole year, I will definitely\u2026\u201dBefore she finished, someone kicked the table in the back of the classroom.The noise in the class stopped abruptly.\u201c\u2014Shut up.\u201dThe whole class looked over in an instant\u2013Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was ugly. When she looked at Lu Zhen\u2019s cold gaze, she realized that her legs went weak.Lu Zhen opened his mouth, every word was very clear: \u201cI was in the same examination room as her. There was no one in the front. I was in the back. The one sitting in her left and right sides scored less than 200 points.\u201dHis lips hooked as he smiled sarcastically, \u201cWhose did she copy, mine?\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was blue and white.No one in the international class dared to say more.At this time, the ranking was also published in Class 5.The first grade in the ranking list, Chu Yin, total score, 713.There were no explanations needed.Who could copy the 1st rank?Whose copy did she copy?Chu Yin looked at the ranking and listened to the wonderful system prompt sound in her mind:Rank first in the whole grade is completed!Congratulations to the host for getting the permission of \u3010Change a single sentence\u3011 and the special reward item \u3010Replace card\u3011 ~ \u201cPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14 \u2013 You show up again!The ranking list posted today was expected to cause a commotion.The student who was ridiculed by the group because of her transcript records ranked first in the whole grade.The explosive news soon spread throughout the school, even reaching the third grade of senior high school.Chu Shi looked several times at the ranking list for the second year in disbelief, while Gu Qiuze stood beside him with a slightly surprised expression.He remembered that day he gave blessings to Chu Yin outside the examination room. Now it seemed that she didn\u2019t need it at all.After Chu Shi confirmed it, there was a strong sense of pride in his heart. He was happier than when he won the prize himself. His voice raised, \u201cMy sister got the 1st rank in the exam!\u201dThe boys around him laughed, \u201cYour sister is in 7th.\u201d\u201cNo, my sister ranked first.\u201d He said.Other people didn\u2019t hear what he said, but Gu Qiuze who was next to him raised his eyebrows and smiled.The girl deliberately concealed herself. Although he didn\u2019t know the reason, he knew that the light she tried to cover would eventually leak.Could she hide it forever?That evening, Chu Shi told Father Chu and Mother Chu the news that Chu Yin was the first in the whole grade.The shock of the two was too obvious since the forks in their hands fell.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cXiao Yin got the first rank in the whole grade in the exam?\u201dChu Qiuqiu sat on the opposite side, her face extremely ugly.She got the seventh rank with a score of 661, which was better than her last semester\u2019s score.She could have been happy showing off to her parents, but now, in front of the 1st rank, her progress and achievements were not worth mentioning.Her biological daughter hadn\u2019t received a good education for ten years, but she was able to get such results. After being surprised, Mother Chu said excitedly, \u201cXiao Yin turned out to be so good! You deserve to be our daughter!\u201dThis sentence didn\u2019t have deep meaning at all, but Chu Qiuqiu suddenly felt it was harsh. Did she mean that Chu Yin was the only real daughter? She squeezed the knife and fork in her hands as her expression became distorted.But Chu Yin\u2019s emotion did not fluctuate.\u2026Worthy of their daughter?All her achievements were learned by herself, which had nothing to do with her blood relationship and the education of the Chu family.Father Chu and Mother Chu felt the same. They proudly believe that Chu Yin was indeed the blood daughter of the Chu Family! With a gratified expression on Father Chu\u2019s face, he said, \u201cOur children are better than others! You are all the pride of your father!\u201dChu Shi looked at his red-faced parents and reminded them, \u201cSo what\u2019s the reward for doing so well in the exam?\u201dFather Chu thought of it and said, \u201cYes! There must be!\u201dIn the past, the Chu family used to give money to them every time they got good grades. Because Xiao Yin gave them a big surprise, she should be rewarded!After dinner, Mother Chu handed a card to Chu Yin: \u201cThere are 200,000 here, take it as pocket money.\u201dWhen Chu Yin raised her eyebrows, she didn\u2019t feel much praise from her parents, but she appreciated the money.After all, she would leave the family, and it was difficult for her to earn money as a minor, so it was necessary to save some savings for herself.\u201cThank you.\u201dChu Qiuqiu also got a reward, but it was only 50,000.In sharp contrast, those who get higher and who were better would get more rewards. This was the rule.Chu Qiuqiu thought she was the pride of the Chu family, but now there was heavy pressure on her head.So, in the future, would their parents give priority to Chu Yin?Chu Qiuqiu suddenly had an unprecedented sense of crisis.No, she won\u2019t allow it to happen.After the mid-term examination, Chu Yin became a celebrity.Strangely, when they ridiculed her grades, no one wanted to know what she looked like. But after she ranked first in the whole grade, they always come over to have a look at her face.But they were all disappointed.\u201cWhy is she wearing a mask?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. What\u2019s more, the school uniform she\u2019s wearing is rustic.\u201d\u201cMaybe this is the appearance of a bookworm\u2026\u201dFu Mingxuan was the second in her class and the fourth in the whole grade. She won several places against Chu Qiuqiu, but she was not happy at all. Now, people came and passed by their class hoping to see Chu Yin. She was more uncomfortable.Xing Lan came over and whispered, \u201cXuanxuan, I heard from my friends in the international class that Chu Qiuqiu was scolded by Lu Zhen that day.\u201dAfter hearing this, Fu Mingxuan finally came to her senses and asked happily, \u201cHow did she provoke Lu Zhen?\u201d\u201cAll the people in their class saw it,\u201d said Xing Lan hesitantly. \u201cIt seems that it was because Chu Qiuqiu said that Chu Yin cheated in the class, and then\u2026\u201dFu Mingxuan suddenly felt she was splashed with cold water.Is Lu Zhen helping Chu Yin speak??The second time?!Xing Lan quickly pulled her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s thinking about her. What do you think will happen if her mask is taken off?\u201dFu Mingxuan sneered: \u201cI guess the lower half of her face is deformed, otherwise why put on a mask every day?\u201dAlthough they didn\u2019t know whether she was deformed or not, they thought that Chu Yin was not beautiful, otherwise, why would she cover her face?Xing Lan suddenly thought of something, winked, and said,\u00a0 \u201cXuanxuan, in a few days\u2026there will be the school flower1\u00a0contest.\u201dAt this time of the year, the selection of the school\u2019s most beautiful and handsome student is an old tradition in Huiwen. Last year, Lu Zhen overtook Gu Qiuze and was cast as the new school\u2019s apollo\u00a02.The special thing about this year was that the selected school flower and apollo would dance together at the upcoming party.The school\u2019s apollo would most likely be Lu Zhen, so Fu Mingxuan did not want to give this opportunity to other girls.Xing Lan\u2019s brain circuit was very simple. Her sisters hate Chu Yin. Even if Chu Yin proves herself with her grades, she still can\u2019t stand Chu Yin.She suggested: \u201cSince people are curious about Chu Yin\u2019s face. We will post photos of her at that time.\u201dFu Mingxuan thought it was a wonderful idea. When the time comes, she would nominate Chu Yin as the school\u2019s flower. Her photo would be posted alongside the other contestant. At the thought that she could crush Chu Yin, her frustration with her grades dissipated.\u201cBut how can we get her picture?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a swimming class next week. I don\u2019t believe she can swim with a mask on.\u201d\u201cRight?!\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin was indifferent to changes in the environment.She had permission to change sentences in her hand. Although she had another card that seemed to be awesome, she didn\u2019t know about the rules, so she was a little cautious.This kind of large-scale authority was rare. It must be used in the plot\u2019s key points.After memorizing the book, Chu Yin spent some time recalling what happened in her last life.Any bad things that could happen\u2026Huiwen had a crappy selection contest. In her last life, she did not deliberately cover up her appearance and was selected as the school\u2019s flower.Lu Zhen, that dog man, was the school\u2019s apollo.These students prefer meaningless titles. They automatically form a customary contest. Lu Zhen seemed to recognize this concept and pursuing her abnormally. The girls who targeted her in the school began to increase suddenly, causing countless troubles for her.In this life, she did nothing to be coupled with the dog man. Who loves to be the school\u2019s flower?\u2014\u2014But.Although she didn\u2019t want to be the school\u2019s flower, she never expected that so many weird rumors began to generate in school.After finishing the system\u2019s task, Chu Yin went to the toilet.She was in the cubicle when she heard chatters outside:\u201cI heard that the face of the student who ranked first is terrible!\u201d\u201cI heard that too! It also said that the lower half of her face is deformed? \u201c\u201cMy God, that\u2019s too bad. Is this the price of having good grades\u2026\u201dThe voice of the people was getting farther away.Chu Yin flushed the toilet without expression. She came out and looked at the mirror.\u2026.Deformed your uncle!!!These non-sense content would not be written in the script. Chu Yin didn\u2019t even know that this kind of rumor spread throughout the whole school.While she walked in the corridor, the stares of the students became even more complex\u2013both curiosity and pity, but also with a little respect. As soon as she passed, she heard whispers.Chu Yin took a deep breath. She simply didn\u2019t want to listen so she put on earphones to listen to a song.It was an old song she liked very much in her last life. The tone was gentle.But before she could listen more, the other side of her earphone was suddenly pulled off gently.As soon as Chu Yin turned around, she saw Lu Zhen\u2019s face.He wore a black sweater. He looked fair and handsome with his tall physique and long legs. The mole at the corner of his eyes made him even more exquisite.As soon as she saw him, Chu Yin remembered the rumor just now, and the pitiful glances along the way\u2014\u2014Who was she wearing the mask for!Who was the cause of the rumor! Because! For! Who!!This son of a bitch doesn\u2019t know at all!! I\u2019ll kill you, Lu Zhen!!!Lu Zhen, who knew nothing about the fluctuations in her mind, lowered his head slightly, only to feel that this little bookworm\u2019s eyes looked brighter and beautiful than before. The heart-throbbing that made him toss and turn for the past several days gently entangled his heart again.He curled his fingers slightly and subconsciously lowered his voice: \u201cWhat are you listening to?\u201dWhen Chu Yin suddenly realized this situation was very familiar, her killing intent grew even more.Lu Zhen also took off her earphones in her previous life and put them on his ears.That time, when Lu Zhen heard the old song. He said that he also liked this kind of song and they seemed to like the same thing.\u2026Dog man shows up a lot.This time, Chu Yin would not give him a chance. She skillfully told the system to open the script then found the sentence:\u3010Lu Zhen put on her earphone and heard the old-song playing on her mobile phone\u3011With a light pen, the \u3010old-song\u3011was changed into the \u3010buddhist-chant\u3011You dare to act coy, dare to flirt again!You go and listen to the Buddhist scripture!Lu Zhen carefully observed her look. When he saw that she did not object, the corners of his lip slightly curled as he put the earphone on his left ear.Then he heard the gentle chant\u2014\u2014\u201cOm Mani Padme Hum\u2026\u201d\u201cOm Mani Padme Hum\u2026\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c???\u201dThe girl\u2019s eyes were innocent: \u201c?\u201dLu Zhen rarely hesitated: \u201cYou\u2019re listening to\u2026the\u00a0Daming Mantra?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Chu Yin nodded, \u201cReminding myself that everything is empty.\u201dDon\u2019t kill, don\u2019t be impulsive:)T/N: OMG!!! HAHAHAHA I\u2019M LAUGHING MY BUTT OFF. GAWD. CHU YIN!Edit: I placed a youtube link for the\u00a0\u2018Om Mani Padme Hum\u2019\u00a0but it seems it will block the mobile screen of other readers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 \u2013 Exposed (1)Lu Zhen was stunned.While he was in a daze, Chu Yin pulled back her earphone and walked back to the classroom.Xueji asked, \u201cHost, have you scared the male lead?\u201dChu Yin giggled, her peach blossom eyes were very beautiful: \u201cIt\u2019s best to frighten him to death.\u201dSince Lu Zhen walked over to her just now, he should have heard those rumors, right? Although it was annoying, she was happy that Lu Zhen heard it.Maybe now in Lu Zhen\u2019s mind, she was not only a student who was ugly and dull but also had some mental problems, otherwise which sane people would listen to Buddhist chants every day!Not bad, not bad, Chu Yin thought, she must continue to do her best! (fist)Lu Zhen only withdrew his gaze when Chu Yin\u2019s back had already disappeared in the corridor.He leaned against the wall and hung his head slightly.After a long time, he gave a low laugh.\u2026\u2026The mid-term exam was finally over, which made the students excited about the selection of the school\u2019s flower and the school\u2019s apollo.Although the students still listened to the teacher\u2019s discussion and studied hard every day, they talked enthusiastically about popular candidates during the class break.The famous candidates were Fu Mingxuan of Class 5 and Chu Qiuqiu of International Class. Both of them were good at studying and a Bai Fumei\u00a01\u00a0in a rich family. Their respective classmates were the ones who greatly supported them.\u201cI think Xuanxuan can win it this time!\u201d\u201cDid you look carefully? Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s facial features are not beautiful. She just puts on make-up.\u201d\u201cYes, her eyes are a little small, plus she has a lot of flesh on her face. She, at most, can be considered cute.\u201dThe boys were confused as they listened to the girls\u2019 conversation. In their eyes, Fu Mingxuan and Chu Qiuqiu were both beautiful.\u201cBut what if there\u2019s a dark horse?\u201d\u201cWho can be the dark horse that can rival their appearances? Everyone knows that\u2019s bullshit.\u201dAs everyone chatted happily during the class break, Chu Yin came back from drinking water. She never moved again from her seat and just kept studying.These school\u2019s flower, school\u2019s apollo, and other exciting things seemed to have nothing to do with her.No one also thought it had anything to do with her.After Chu Yin got the first rank, the atmosphere in Class 5 became a little fragile and subtle. Although one dared to laugh at her wantonly, she still had no friends in the class.Chu Yin\u2019s extremely high grades had attracted attention to her, and her low-key style of behavior added a sense of mystery. Although no one talked about it, many people were staring at her secretly.\u201cBy the way, have you heard that rumor\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that, is it true? She\u2019s that ugly?\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s possible. After all, I\u2019ve never seen her take off her mask\u2026\u201dHearing everyone talked about Chu Yin\u2019s appearance, Xing Lan and Fu Mingxuan exchanged looks at each other.Since everyone was so curious, they would soon satisfy them~After a day, the registration system for the school\u2019s flower and the school\u2019s apollo officially opened for all the students of Huiwen Private Middle School. Anyone who was interested could sign up. After they fill in their class, their name, and their photo, it will be pending for review.In addition to Fu Mingxuan in Class 5, several girls also applied. After all, the title of \u201cschool flower\u201d was too dazzling. Aside from students from other schools coming to inquire, they would become popular in Huiwen Private Middle School. Everyone wanted to try it.What\u2019s more, after the selection was over, there would be a dance party for the whole school. Who didn\u2019t want to be noticed on such a grand occasion?Students in the International Class were also discussing this matter. They were all talking about voting for Chu Qiuqiu at the same time.Song Zhaolin came to visit the class to play. He was chatting with Tan Ke in the back of the classroom. After listening to him, he turned to look at Lu Zhen.\u201cBrother Zhen, are you participating this year?\u201dLu Zhen looked at him as if he was mentally retarded.Tan Ke kicked Song Zhaolin\u2019s butt: \u201cAre you stupid? Brother Zhen did not sign up last year.\u201dSong Zhaolin dodged Tan Ke\u2019s kick and said with a smile: \u201cYes. Since Brother Zhen didn\u2019t sign up, someone signed him up. Cough Cough\u2026By the way, with my appearance, do you think I can be qualified to run this year?\u201dHe inserted his one hand in his pocket, brushed his hair with his other hand, and said, \u201cI think I can get a thousand votes too!\u201dTan Ke snickered at him, \u201cForget about the school\u2019s apollo. I\u2019ll help you sign up for the school\u2019s flower. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get thousands of votes.\u201dSong Zhaolin pounced on him: \u201cYour uncle!\u201dAt this moment, a burst of exclamation broke out in the classroom of international class\u2014\u2014\u201cShit, this is the first rank in our grade?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how she looks?\u201d\u201cMy God, it\u2019s scary\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin froze. The person who got the first rank was his deskmate\u2026Chu Yin?How scary did she look?The international class asked Chu Qiuqiu with a picture in their hand: \u201cQiuqiu, does your sister look like this??\u201dChu Qiuqiu looked at the photo. It was edited. The big nose and the protruding mouth did not belong to Chu Yin. But when she looked at it, she felt an indescribable joy in her heart.Chu Yin\u2019s behavior might have offended someone which resulted in this ugly photo being posted throughout the grade.Chu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t want to explain for Chu Yin.She nodded vaguely, her mind in a state of complication, \u201cAlmost.\u201dThe students sighed again. It seemed that although the daughter of the Chu family studied well, she was far inferior to Chu Qiuqiu.Tan Ke also received the photo in the group on his mobile phone. He clicked on it and gave a \u2018tsk\u2019, \u201cShe does not look good.\u201dSong Zhaolin grabbed his mobile phone to look. The group said that this was the photo of the first ranking student. If anyone looked carefully, the first half of the face was Chu Yin\u2019s, but the second half was not at all??The combination of the lower half of the face and the delicate eyes were in extreme conflict that it was indeed very frightening.But the person who edited this picture was very skilled! If it wasn\u2019t because Song Zhaolin had seen Chu Yin\u2019s face, he would have believed it too!Tan Ke took his mobile phone to Lu Zhen, who glanced at him and frowned.Tan Ke gave his mobile to Lu Zhen, who only glanced at it before frowning.\u201cWho posted it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It just spread in the group\u2026\u201dLu Zhen leaned back in his chair, but after a glimpse of a familiar figure passing by the back door, he suddenly got up and chased her.Song Zhaolin craned his neck and said in surprise, \u201cIsn\u2019t that my deskmate? Why did Brother Zhen chase her?\u201dFuck, did he go bother his Sister Yin because of the ugly picture??Tan Ke asked: \u201cLinzi, your bookworm deskmate looks like this?\u201dSong Zhaolin retracted his neck and said, \u201cBullshit! She doesn\u2019t look like this. Chu Yin is really beautiful.\u201d\u201c???\u201d Looking at this photo, Tan Ke couldn\u2019t imagine her beautiful face so he simply put his phone in his bag.Outside the classroom.Since Lu Zhen had long legs, he caught up with Chu Yin in a few steps.She was wearing earphones today and he didn\u2019t know what she was listening to.Lu Zhen walked over and gently took off her earphone. The moment the girl looked back, she didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion, but he felt a trace of a murderous aura in her eyes.Lu Zhen raised his eyebrows, somehow wanted to laugh.He didn\u2019t think it was very important whether the ugly photo was her or not.His mother was beautiful enough, but so what? Things that were too beautiful would just attract annoying flies. All his life, his father became crazy because of the covetous eyes of people towards his wife\u2026he died pitifully young.He didn\u2019t want to be that kind of person.Lu Zhen looked down at her: \u201cAre you also listening to the Buddhist Chant today?\u201dBecause Chu Yin had encountered Lu Zhen several times in a row, her heart was on full alert.But after observing Lu Zhen\u2019s expression, she felt it was different from the way he looked at her\u2013like she was his prey, in the previous life.There\u2019s nothing wrong with this dog man, right??To be on the safe side, Chu Yin decided to continue to assimilate her \u2018nerd\u2019 character. This time, she offered to hand him the earphone.Lu\u00a0 Zhen was slightly startled. His fingertips quivered uncontrollably while he took the earphone from her hand and put it on.There was the remaining warmth of her skin on the earphone. It took Lu Zhen a second before he could what was in the earphone\u2014\u2014\u201c- college entrance examination English listening,\u201d Chu Yin told him without expression, \u201cone volume of the new curriculum standard in 2019.\u201d\u201c\u2014English Listening for the College Entrance Examination Level,\u201d Chu Yin told him expressionlessly, \u201cNew curriculum standards for 2019, volume 1.\u201dThen she saw a trace of amazement on Lu Zhen\u2019s face and immediately felt very satisfied.My heart only has learning, okay!When Lu Zhen came back to the classroom again, he had a slight smile on his face.Song Zhaolin had not left yet. He was relieved to see him like this. He thought Brother Zhen was going to do something to his Sister Yin.\u201cBrother Zhen, why did you look for my deskmate?\u201d Song Zhaolin asked curiously.Lu Zhen raised his head, his eyes were dark. All of a sudden, he felt that the tone of his words was very unpleasant.\u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Song Zhaolin changed the topic, \u201cBy the way, will you go to the swimming class?\u201dHuiwen is an elite school with outstanding establishments in the city. The swimming pool infrastructure was first-class, it has the best temperature control. Because of this, it could be used as a competition venue.This semester, there were a few swimming classes where several classes gather together.Tan Ke was a little fat and had lots of flesh on his body. He didn\u2019t want to go even if his points would get deducted.Although Lu Zhen had a good figure, he wasn\u2019t interested.Song Zhaolin sighed disappointedly: \u201cOk, I will go\u2013my deskmate doesn\u2019t believe that I have abdominal muscles, I must show it to her!\u201dAlthough Chu Yin didn\u2019t ask him to show it, what Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t bear was being looked down upon by beautiful women!After finished speaking, he suddenly felt that the air was cold.As soon as he raised his head, he shuddered subconsciously at Lu Zhen\u2019s cold gaze.\u201cYou?\u201d Lu Zhen glanced over and said, \u201cAbdominal muscles?\u201dSong Zhaolin had just been looked down upon by the beautiful woman and the handsome man. He cried aggrievedly.I know you have eight packs!!! Aighh I can\u2019t show off these three or four packs, TAT!The world was too hostile to him!!Chapter 15 \u2013 Exposed (2)Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to go to this swimming lesson.Although the class representative said that she would not deduct points for the class, she didn\u2019t want to act too special by not attending.But she didn\u2019t plan to go into the water. She just wanted to go over and find a place to do the problem.The rest of Class 5 were excited\u2014\u2014The boys and girls at this age were naturally curious about the body of the opposite sex. The boys dreamed about girls wearing swimsuits, especially Fu Mingxuan, the class\u2019 flower. It\u2019s paradise.The girls were mixed with shyness and excitement. Since the selection of the school\u2019s flower began, the swimming class was an excellent opportunity to show off their body. At this time, everyone would pay attention to the person who wore the best swimsuit and who had the best figure.If they could stand out and surprise everyone, they could get more votes in the selection!Like the previous public math class, both the swimming lessons of Class 5 and International Class was the same. Although Lu Zhen never took swimming lessons last year, the girls still had a glimmer of expectations.As soon as the class before the swimming class finished, the girls all ran away. They immediately went to the fitting room of the swimming pool to change their swimsuits. The boys said they didn\u2019t care, but in fact, they left the classroom in twos and threes to go to the swimming pool.It wasn\u2019t until half of the class went away that Chu Yin unhurriedly put down her exercise book.\u201cDing\u2013Completed exercises of Geography \u221a 95% speed rate. Granted the [change a word] permission. ~ Host, your answering speed has become faster~!\u201dChu Yin also found that the more she learned, the more flexible her brain was. If only she could have this motivation in her last life.She raised her head and planned to go to the swimming pool now, only to find that there was still a person left in the classroom.That was a girl sitting in front of her. Chu Yin remembered her name was Jiang Yan. She got good grades and was the third in her class. The girl was usually very quiet and hardworking.But today, Jiang Yan stood up and looked at her side, and suddenly said, \u201cStudents who study hard are most worthy of admiration. I admire you very much. I hope you pay attention to those people in our grade.\u201dChu Yin was dumbfounded for a long time. She was a little surprised. When she recovered, she soon returned a friendly smile\u00a01, \u201cOkay, thank you.\u201dJiang Yan probably didn\u2019t expect her to be so friendly. She hesitated for a moment and then said, \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing wrong with looking bad. It\u2019s shameful to expose other people\u2019s privacy. You should be strong and not be affected.\u201dChu Yin was stunned this time.After Jiang Yan decisively spoke the words she had been holding back for a long time, she finally felt comfortable. With these, she walked out of the classroom.Chu Yin went to the swimming pool in confusion. She entered the locker room. While changing clothes, she thought of Jiang Yan\u2019s words.Behind the lockers, there were voices of the two girls.\u201cDid you see that the first rank of our grade has signed up for school flower?\u201d\u201cI saw it. Hahaha! She is so brave. That photo of her\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s ugly. Chu Shi is so handsome, and Chu Qiuqiu is also pretty. Why does she look like that?\u201d\u201cIs she a biological daughter?\u201d\u201cGee, I\u2019ve got goosebumps. Ahh, let\u2019s change our clothes. It\u2019s time for class.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin held the locker and was speechless for a while.She knew two things:1. Just like in her previous life, someone nominated her for the school\u2019s flower.2. Someone was spreading her photos, which seemed to be \u2018heavily edited\u2019.Chu Yin thought about it and guessed that it was likely Fu Mingxuan.She tapped on the system: \u201cUnlock the script.\u201d\u3010Setting: Swimming Pool. Characters: Students from Class 5 and International class.\u3011\u3010\u2026\u2026Among the beautiful swimsuits of the girls, Chu Yin wore a professional black swimsuit under her white T-shirt. With her mask, she seemed out of place.A group of girls showed off their bodies before they began to go into the water.Chu Yin was about to study in a place where no one was. Suddenly, Xing Lan came up to her and asked with a smile, \u201cChu Yin, why don\u2019t you go into the water?\u201dChu Yin replied, \u201cAfraid of the cold\u201dThen when she turned to leave, Xing Lan lightly pushed her to the swimming pool.\u3011Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThere were no such events in her last life. She guessed that Xing Lan\u2019s small tricky movements were for her to take off her mask and show her face.However, pushing others into the water was too naive and vicious.What if she couldn\u2019t swim? What if there was no teacher around?Many things in the world of novels were illogical. Chu Yin had experienced too much hostility in her last life. Fortunately, in this life, she had a magic pen that could rewrite events. She did not intend to be soft-hearted at all.She asked Xueji, \u201cHow permissions do I have in my account?\u201dXueji: \u201c[Change three words], [Replace Card], [Change a sentence]. Host, do you want to use the modify single sentence permission?\u201dChu Yin thought for a moment: \u201cNo, it\u2019s too wasteful.\u201dShe can change three words altogether.Xueji had already recognized her host\u2019s ability to modify scripts, it was looking forward to it.When the light pen moved to the sentence [ Xing Lan lightly pushed ] , Chu Yin changed [ lightly pushed ] to [ slipped her feet ] .She perfectly changed these words.Xueji \u201cYou are the best in changing these words!! [thumbs up]]After changing the plot, Chu Yin put a loose white shirt over her black swimsuit and went into the swimming pool.By the pool, the scene in the plot had begun.Fu Mingxuan was wearing a carefully selected swimsuit, pure and slightly revealing, with a trace of sexiness to it. The boys in Class 5 were a little blushing. And it was the same as the international class in the opposite, Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s figure was good, although not tall, but very slender.The boys secretly discussed who to vote for when the voting system opened tomorrow.Seeing Chu Yin\u2019s simple dress up, Class 5 was used to it. Fu Mingxuan and Xing Lan looked at each other and quietly made a gesture.The class started immediately, but there was another commotion at the door.\u201c\u2014Lu Zhen!\u201d\u201cBrother Zhen is coming!\u201d\u201cAh, ah, my stomach is tightening\u2026Remember to remind me not to relax!\u201dLu Zhen was also wearing a shirt. He is tall and has long legs. His forearm muscles are firm and smooth. He looked lazy as if he didn\u2019t care, but his sight glanced around the whole stadium.Seeing the slender figure shrinking at the edge spot of Class 5, the corner of his lips curled slightly.After Lu Zhen came, the atmosphere in the venue changed again. From time to time, the girls in Class 5 looked at the opposite side. One by one, they adjusted their hairstyles. Only Chu Yin lowered her head and hid in the crowd with a low sense of existence.The teacher of the swimming class came over with a book. When both the classes were ready, the classes began.After warming up, the teacher explained a few words\u2013the students who could swim could practice freely, and those who couldn\u2019t swim could come to her to practice together.As soon as the crowd dispersed, Fu Mingxuan pinched Xing Lan. The latter suddenly called out: \u201cAh, Chu Yin! Why are you still wearing a mask?\u201dThis time, all the eyes were focused on Chu Yin.The teacher also looked back and slightly frowned: \u201cStudent, you can\u2019t wear a mask during swimming class.\u201dChu Yin quickly coughed twice, and her voice was weak: \u201cTeacher, I have a cold. I\u2019m afraid of infecting my classmates.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Since the girl insisted on coming to class even when she was ill, the teacher didn\u2019t have any trouble with her.But the students knew she\u2019s lying! Chu Yin was not sick. She usually wore a mask, okay!Now they were more convinced that Chu Yin was absolutely ugly because she did not dare to show her face.At the thought of the next plan, both of them were excited, especially Fu Mingxuan. Lu Zhen was here. If Lu Zhen saw her ugly face, would he still protect this country bumpkin in the future?Seeing that the teacher had gone to teach the students to swim, Chu Yin planned to slip out to study. She was far away from the pool, but the two people had planned it for so long that they wouldn\u2019t let her go.Xing Lan ran over and affectionately took Chu Yin to the swimming pool: \u201cChu Yin, why don\u2019t you go into the water?\u201dChu Yin kindly reminded her: \u201cThe ground is slippery, be careful.\u201dXing Lan, who was noticing this, said with a smile \u201cnothing\u201d, and then stretched out her hand towards Chu Yin\u2019s back\u2014\u2014Who knew that Chu Yin looked like she had eyes on the back of her head? She immediately evaded to the side.The soles of Xing Lan\u2019s feet slipped, and she flew out, with a bang, and fell into the pool like a bomb.Chu Yin wiped the water splashed on her eyes: \u201cI told you to be careful.\u201dShe shook her head, and just before she turned around, she suddenly saw Fu Mingxuan holding a bucket. She didn\u2019t know where she came from. At that moment, she felt a foreboding in her heart.Fu Mingxuan laughed and splashed her with water, \u201cChu Yin, let\u2019s play with the water.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe script didn\u2019t tell her there was Plan B?!The bucket of water was solidly poured on Chu Yin, and her mask was washed down.Chu Yin wiped her face then lifted her wet hair back, revealing a white and clean forehead and delicate eyebrows.She was pissed off.This idiot.Fu Mingxuan had already greeted her and rushed forward, grabbing her mask directly with her fingers, \u201cOh, you can\u2019t wear a wet mask!\u201dIn her previous life, Chu Yin was trapped by the top wealthiest person. Self-defense was a necessary skill and this was taught by Lu Zhen. When Fu Mingxuan waved her hand up, Chu Yin raised her hand to twist her wrist and pressed her down.Fu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t stand the pain and exhaled aggrievedly.This commotion soon attracted the attention of the people around them.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDamn! They fought?\u201d\u201cWho???\u201dWhen Lu Zhen heard the news, he looked back and saw this picture, his face suddenly turned ugly. He hurriedly strode over.Fu Mingxuan was also willing to go all out, she must show Chu Yin today!With all her strength, her hand suddenly grasped Chu Yin\u2019s face, grabbed the precarious wet mask, and yanked it down!\u2014\u2014Show your ugly face!!The tether of the mask broke and fell to the ground, and Chu Yin\u2019s face was finally revealed.Fu Mingxuan was ecstatic but suddenly she was stunned.Not only her, but the people watching this scene was suddenly pressed down in silence. There was suddenly no sound.Under the mask, there was no big nose nor a protruding mouth.Only a small face as big as a palm, white, and moist, like delicate porcelain. The bridge of her nose was pretty. Her lips are crimson and the bead lying on her upper lips was attractive. This lower half of the face combined with the brows and eyes under her wet hair formed a completely alluring and exquisite appearance.At this time, Lu Zhen with the voice of ice, sounded behind her: \u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dThis was to deal with Fu Mingxuan.Chu Yin\u2019s heart trembled, and she hurriedly went to the dressing room.He shouldn\u2019t see her face.People around them were stupefied. Looking at the beautiful face, no one dared to stop her.At this time, Song Zhaolin suddenly came out and grabbed Chu Yin: \u201cSister Yin! Are you okay?\u201dChu Yin was caught off guard as she was spun around by the force.Then she met Lu Zhen\u2019s dark eyes directly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 \u2013 Who\u2019s the school flower? (1)Chu Yin thought that If she had a hammer in her hand now, she would have difficulty choosing whether to hammer Lu Zhen first or Song Zhaolin first.She had been hiding from this dog man for two months now, but because of this, all her achievements fell in vain.Chu Yin: I could cry right now.jpgOf course, no one knew what Chu Yin was thinking at the moment.The pool stadium was quiet. Only the sound of water waves could be heard. The eyes of all the students followed Lu Zhen, and then on the girl.She was partly drenched in water. Her white t-shirt clung to her body, revealing the deep black swimsuit inside and showing the girl\u2019s natural curves. She looked even more fragile with her wet ponytail hair and her fluttery eyelashes that covered her peach blossom eyes.Just like that, she caught Lu Zhen\u2019s attention unexpectedly.For these few seconds, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know if he was still breathing.When he recovered, he withdrew his gaze away. His breath had become deep and stale with indescribable hotness.The heat quickly ran through his whole body while his fingertips turned numb.In front of the girl\u2019s uneasy eyes, Lu Zhen subconsciously controlled his own expression, making him look unmoved.The ridiculous edited picture and the circulating rumors all collapsed in front of everyone.She\u2019s frighteningly beautiful.Behind Lu Zhen, the sounds of the boys\u2019 breath could be heard, \u201cDamn it, she\u2026\u201d is beautiful.Lu Zhen suddenly frowned. He pulled a large towel from the side and threw it on Chu Yin\u2019s body, covering her soaked t-shirt.\u201cGo and change.\u201dChu Yin realized that some things were different from the previous life.At least at the moment, Lu Zhen seemed normal. Except for the first second of surprise in his eyes, there was no lovesick emotion Chu Yin found unpleasant. He seemed a little restless and impatient this time.Chu Yin held the towel in her arms, her mind relaxing slightly.She shook off Song Zhaolin\u2019s hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dSong Zhaolin blinked his eyes. He didn\u2019t know why but he felt that Chu Yin was actually saying,\u00a0\u2018You\u2019re dead.\u2019How could this be? He was just worried about her!After Chu Yin\u2019s figure disappeared to the dressing room, the \u2018buzzing\u2019 sound in the stadium resumed.Everyone felt the explosion of an unexpected situation. After all, they had seen the widely circulated picture and heard various versions of rumors. But who knew that she had a very beautiful face underneath that mask?\u201cFuck, who\u2019s the one in the photo?\u201d\u201cIs that really Chu Yin?? Damn, she\u2019s so beautiful! I think I\u2019m in love!\u201d\u201cTherefore, she\u2019s not just good at learning, but also beautiful. A goddess!\u201dBut Fu Mingxuan, who had contributed to all this, was totally stupefied.Finally, she climbed back to the surface to witness the historic moment.They had imagined a variety of ugly methods but did not think that Chu Yin was the other end of the two poles. Fu Mingxuan didn\u2019t want to admit that she was shocked at that moment.Lu Zhen took a breath, suppresses his emotions, and then turned to look at Fu Mingxuan.Fu Mingxuan had been trying to attract Lu Zhen\u2019s attention. Now, Lu Zhen finally looked at her, but Fu Mingxuan felt a trace of fear instead.Lu Zhen\u2019s expression was very indifferent as he looked at her and asked: \u201cLike to play with water?\u201dFu Mingxuan subconsciously stepped back two steps: \u201cNo, no, we were just having fun\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin jumped: \u201cNonsense! you started to scratch Sister Chu Yin\u2019s face!\u201dThe corner of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips lifted as he raised his finger to pinch the back of Fu Mingxuan\u2019s neck, making her lose her balance and fell back to the pool.\u201cFor fun? Then go and play.\u201dWith a sharp cry, the water splashed as Fu Mingxuan shamelessly fell into the water.Everyone saw what happened just now. Chu Yin did not want to get wet but Fu Mingxuan threw water on her. So when Fu Minxuan was thrown into the water by Lu Zhen, no one dared to rescue her.Jiang Yan had been quietly memorizing words on the other side. After seeing all this, she pushed her glasses: \u201cYou deserve it.\u201dAlso, she was a little embarrassed. Just before class, she also told Chu Yin that it\u2019s okay to look bad. At that time, Chu Yin might have felt it was a joke, right? She\u2019s really beautiful.Students in the international class were all talking about it, but their focus was different.\u201cWhen I asked Chu Qiuqiu about the photo before, she said it was almost the same?\u201d\u201cHow could the photo look the same with Chu Yin\u2019s face? There\u2019s a lot of difference.\u201d\u201cDid you guys notice that Chu Yin\u2019s face resembled Chu Qiuqiu a little?\u201d\u201cIt seems so, but..\u201dThe words were swallowed back, but everyone knew what they meant.\u2014\u2014However, there were obvious differences in appearance. Before, they thought Chu Qiuqiu was a little beauty, but compared with Chu Yin\u2019s facial features, she was totally inferior.\u201cAre they twins? That explains why they look alike?\u201d\u201cChu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t say that, and the Chu family didn\u2019t say it publicly. Does anyone know their birthdays?\u201d\u201cFuck, why do I feel a little horrified when thinking these things\u2026\u201dAfter Chu Qiuqiu vaguely heard these conversations, she felt her limbs going stiff and chilly.Will anyone guess it? No, No\u2014\u2014She did not come from a poor family. She was not a substitute. She was the daughter of the wealthy Chu family.Chu Yin was the country bumpkin who was brought back from the village!\u2026Chu Yin sat on the bench in the dressing room, calming herself down.Through today\u2019s events, she learned something new\u2013she had no way of knowing the changes of the script after she modifies a word. In short, after she making a few changes, the script would generate a new direction.Wearing the mask was not a long-term plan. She also felt uncomfortable wearing the mask every day. Now that her face was revealed, there was no need to wear it back.\u201c\u2026Is it really impossible to change schools?\u201d Chu Yin poke system.Xueji:\u00a0 \u201cNo, host. According to the system calculation, if you transfer schools by force, under the influence of male lead\u2019s power on the plot, the probability of him transferring to the same school as you is as high as 90%~ \u201cChu Yin: Shit.With her elbows on her knees, she was thinking about the numerous possibilities in her brain.Could she make Lu Zhen lose his memory? Or let Lu Zhen be in a car crash, have cerebral palsy, and be turned into a vegetative state?Since she couldn\u2019t attack him directly in the script, she could arrange it indirectly?\u201cHost, your mind is dangerous. \u201cChu Yin sighed.Having this chicken (system) in her head felt like having surveillance that prevents her from embarking on a criminal path.But fortunately, she already deviated from the plot to the utmost extent. At least in this lifetime, Lu Zhen\u2019s view of her was different from the previous life.Moreover, she could continue to change the script in the future. Now that the enemy was in the dark, why would she afraid of the dog man??Having figured this out, Chu Yin stood up and changed her wet clothes. Now that her name was already called by the teacher, she didn\u2019t plan to go back to class. She put on her big uniform and walked out of the swimming pool.There was a tall old tree outside the stadium. The young man stood quietly in the shade and took a look.Because the students were in the classrooms, the campus was empty and quiet. Lu Zhen looked at her face cautiously as he subconsciously rubbed his knuckles.Chu Yin didn\u2019t move. Lu Zhen simply walked over to her and stopped.This time, without the mask, Chu Yin\u2019s whole face was exposed in front of his eyes, and every inch of expression was very clear.Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze fell on her overly delicate eyes before retreating his gaze.He asked, \u201cWho taught you how to fight?\u201dWhen Chu Yin twisted Fu Mingxuan\u2019s wrist, it was fast and accurate, as if someone had taught her.Chu Yin was surprised and thought that Lu Zhen, that dog man, was very keen.This question, asked by Lu Zhen himself, felt a little funny. Since she didn\u2019t like bodyguards following her, Lu Zhen forced her to learn all kids of self-defense skills. She even learned a bit of Sanda, which Lu Zhen taught personally.Later, after learning it, Chu Yin still liked the sport, because You can beat him blatantly, and Lu Zhen will release water to her. And he is a real pervert. Sometimes Chu Yin fought hard, and he was very happy.After learning it, Chu Yin grew to like this sport because she could beat him blatantly. Moreover, she thought Lu Zhen was a bit perverted. Whenever Chu Yin beat him hard, he would be happy.Chu Yin felt regretful thinking that she couldn\u2019t beat him in the face anymore.She raised her eyes and pretended to be ignorant: \u201cI didn\u2019t learn it.\u201dLu Zhen laughed. Liar.But her eyes were so clear that when she looked up slightly, the light and shadow from the shade fell on her face. It was as beautiful as a painting.He smelled the faint fragrance again, which the autumn wind blew as it lingered on his nostrils.Lu Zhen\u2019s heartbeat was in chaos. He did not continue to ask.Of course, Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to continue to recall the past with him. When he stopped talking, Chu Yin turned around and left.On the way to the classroom, she also ran into another attendant (Tan Ke) next to Lu Zhen. When the boy saw her, his eyes widened. He waited until the entrance of the swimming pool with a little red on his face.Just after Song Zhaolin changed his clothes and chased him out, Chu Yin had gone far away, without any hesitation, as usual.Tan Ke\u2019s face was shocked: \u201cDamn, I saw a beautiful woman just now.\u201dSong Zhaolin said, \u201cEveryone saw it.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Tan Ke was surprised. \u201cWhat class is she from? What\u2019s her name?\u201dLu Zhen retracted his gaze, his eyebrows suddenly folded.Song Zhaolin, who had seen Chu Yin\u2019s beautiful face before, felt a burst of pride: \u201cMy deskmate! Didn\u2019t I tell you she\u2019s really pretty!\u201dTan Ke\u2019s chin fell off: \u201cThat\u2019s Chu Yin?! How did you know she\u2019s beautiful?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it!\u201dIn an instant, Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes became colder, and an unpleasant aura came out from his body.Chapter 16 \u2013 Who\u2019s the school flower? (2)Sensing the danger instinctively, Song Zhaolin closed his mouth and leaned to Tan Ke.Tan Ke digested the news, suddenly looked up to the direction Chu Yin left, and said, \u201cFuck. Chu Yin can be a school flower.\u201dThat girl was really beautiful, the kind where people couldn\u2019t retract their gaze.Song Zhaolin could only speak his mind: \u201cAh? Then will Sister Yin dance with brother Zhen?\u201dEven when it was a retarded question, Lu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows suddenly pricked.\u201cYou stupid, how can Brother Zhen participate in the school dance?\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t the school\u2019s flower and school\u2019s apollo a couple\u2026\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes slightly, the restlessness of his body quietly dissipated.The next day when Chu Yin went to school, she was still in loose old school uniform but did not wear a mask.Everyone couldn\u2019t help watching the slender girl walking on the campus.Chu Yin\u2019s previous life was the same. Since her transfer to this school, this kind of attention had never been less. But at that time, people only thought she was a beautiful vase. she was scrutinized and mocked. Although she was beautiful, she was nothing more than a country bumpkin.This time, the eyes cast towards her revealed a hint of amazement and admiration.That\u2019s Chu Yin, a transfer student from class 5, currently in the first rank.Not only smart but also very good-looking.Chu Yin was used to this kind of attention in her last life. She reviewed the knowledge points in her mind and walked into the building.But what she didn\u2019t know was that after just walking around the campus in this way, countless people decided to vote for her.Today, the voting system of the school\u2019s flower and the school\u2019s apollo officially opened.The people in class 5 were talking about it noisily, but when Chu Yin came in, the noisy classroom suddenly became quiet.This impact was still too big, even if the class had been discussing all day since yesterday, their eyes still shook when they saw Chu Yin\u2019s face again.A boy who had just talked to Fu Mingxuan looked up, his face turned red as he stammered: \u201cVote, vote, I will vote for her\u2026\u201dFu Mingxuan, almost losing her temper: \u201cWho will you vote for?\u201d\u201cVote for you, vote for you!\u201dFu Mingxuan\u2019s expression looked very ugly. Yesterday, Lu Zhen threw her into the water, and the whole grade thought of her as a joke.She picked up a stone and hit her own foot this time \u2013 Because she submitted Chu Yin\u2019s name in the school\u2019s flower register, she already doubted whether she would win the school\u2019s flower title or not.Jiang Yan was not a person who would care about these things. But looking at Fu Mingxuan\u2019s face and the suddenly embarrassed students in the class, she felt a kind of pride.Regardless of having a poor learning experience from the countryside, Chu Yin still got first place. Some of the students were jealous so they spread rumors that she was ugly, but she turned out to be very beautiful.That\u2019s a slap in the face, wasn\u2019t it? Chu Yin was really a treasured girl!Jiang Yan took the initiative to say hello to her: \u201cGood morning.\u201dWhen Chu Yin saw her, she smiled, \u201cGood morning.\u201dHer slight smile, her beautiful peach eyes like falling stars\u2026even Jiang Yan\u2019s eyes were dazzled.Even after the environment changed, Chu Yin still only had learning in her heart. During class breaks, she and Jiang Yan would usually sit in their seats and continue to study.When Song Zhaolin attended school today, he inexplicably received Chu Yin\u2019s thousand death glares. He didn\u2019t know what he did wrong.But even a death glare could be turned into a beautiful death glare!Song Zhaolin waited until Chu Yin was tired and rested. He leaned to the edge of Chu Yin\u2019s desk: \u201cSister Yin, do you know that today many people asked me for your phone number?\u201dChu Yin began to review the topic again and said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t give it.\u201dSong Zhaolin snorted, \u201cOf course I can\u2019t give it! Because I don\u2019t have it either.\u201dChu Yin coldly snorted back.Song Zhaolin threw several winks and pitifully said, \u201cPlease give me your number. We have been deskmates for two months and haven\u2019t added each other to WeChat. I didn\u2019t know that our relationship is this bad\u2026\u201dChu Yin: \u201cThank you\u2026but no.\u201dBut after saying this, she allowed Song Zhaolin to scan her WeChat. In essence, she didn\u2019t hate Song Zhaolin. Although this guy was a little stupid, he was quite cute. The two months were quite pleasant.Song Zhaolin held his mobile phone happily, and received a large number of glances from the boys in the class. He was extremely happy: \u201cYeah~I added the school\u2019s flower\u2019s WeChat~\u201dChu Yin\u2019s pen stopped: \u201cSchool\u2019s flower?\u201dSong Zhaolin turned over Chu Yin\u2019s circle of friends and said without raising his head, \u201cDidn\u2019t you see the vote?\u201dBefore someone maliciously gave Chu Yin a name, which can\u2019t be undone, but Chu Yin didn\u2019t let go of a picture and didn\u2019t introduce himself, so he should be squeezed to the last.Before the event happened, someone maliciously nominated Chu Yin\u2019s name in the contest. This action couldn\u2019t be undone. Although Chu Yin didn\u2019t put a photo nor introduced herself, she must be in the last place.Listening to Song Zhaolin\u2019s words, Chu Yin had a bad premonition.She logged into the forum, found the voting interface, and almost fainted.\u2014\u2014The voting exploded.Chu Yin, who was ignorant, ranked first with 1210 votes. The next highest did not break 800.She glanced casually. Fu Mingxuan 560 votes and Chu Qiuqiu 534 votes. Their competition was very tight, but they were far away from first place.There was a message board at the bottom of the vote, which was updated in real-time.[ I was going to vote for XXX, but after seeing someone today, I announced my defection. ][ I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve defected, too ][ Brothers, put XX on the public screen! ]Even more exaggerated were direct loveconfessions:[ I\u2019m Zheng Yu from third-year international class. I fell in love with Chu Yin at first sight. Please look at me! ][ I\u2019m Chu Yin\u2019s brother, I don\u2019t agree with this marriage ][ ha ha ha ha ha ha fuck ]\u2026\u2026Chu Yin\u2019s head hurt.When she saw the 2000 votes of Lu Zhen in the selection of the school\u2019s apollo, her head hurt even more.The two sides echoed each other, like some kind of foreboding.\u2014\u2014No way.Can\u2019t go back to the same way in her previous life!This critical plot was quietly turning back to the original script. She must correct it. \u201cTo be a school\u2019s flower\u201d is a bad title in her life. Standing at this junction, she couldn\u2019t just sit back and wait to die.Song Zhaolin went through Chu Yin\u2019s WeChat feeds with content, liked them one by one, and then said, \u201cDid you see me? The one at the bottom with more than 40 votes.\u201dAlthough he was in the school\u2019s flower category, Song Zhaolin felt that at least 40 people recognized his beauty!It felt pleasant when thinking about this.\u201cWhen you become a school\u2019s flower, I will be your guardian knight since I\u2019m deskmates with you. By the way\u2013\u201d Song Zhaolin murmured like an old mother, \u201cYou\u2019ll dance with Brother Zhen. People will pay attention to the dance, and you\u2019ll even look more beautiful\u2026\u201dChu Yin: Shit!!Who wanted to dance with Lu Zhen???When all the students were gone after school, Chu Yin calmed down and knocked on the system. \u201cRelease the script.\u201dAccording to the script, Fu Mingxuan and Chu Qiuqiu would try their best to canvas for votes tonight and even bribe their classmates in order not to let Chu Yin become the school flower.\u3010But in the end, Chu Yin was elected school\u2019s flower by a 100 votes margin. \u3011That\u2019s what the script says.Xueji reminded: \u201cHost, do you want to use [change single sentence] permission?\u201dChu Yin thought for a long time: \u201cUse.\u201dIn any case, she should not win the school\u2019s flower title and be chased by Lu Zhen.\u201cRemind ~ the usage rule of this permission is to compare the cause and effect. For example, if the host wants to change the outcome of the school\u2019s flower, it needs to change the candidate of the school flower, but the host can not choose a person who did not participate in the selection because of the lack of antecedents. To modify a whole sentence of the plot, the description needs to be logically self-consistent.\u201dAfter listening carefully, Chu Yin\u2019s eyes moved slowly to the seat beside her.I see.At 10 p.m., the voting system would be closed for an hour.Now that the overall situation had been decided, Lu Zhen had been elected as the school\u2019s apollo, and although the contestants of the school\u2019s flower increases, Chu Yin was still at the top.There was a lot of noise on the message board below.[ To be honest, I don\u2019t think Chu Yin is worthy to be a school flower. ][ I reasonably suspect that she was self-made. She wore a mask for two months to attract people\u2019s appetites. She only removed it before the school\u2019s flower selections. Wasn\u2019t that intentional? ][ It\u2019s unreasonable. The mask was removed by FMX ][ Oh, someone is protecting the lord?\u00a01 ][ Even I, a man, don\u2019t see anything exceptional from her taste of clothes. ][ I\u2019m afraid that Huiwen Private Middle School will choose a country bumpkin as the school\u2019s flower ]\u2026\u2026When Lu Zhen was cast as the school\u2019s apollo last year, he never paid attention to it.But this year, for no apparent reason, he took a look before the vote was closed.Chu Yin was the first.Lu Zhen was slightly distracted. Would she dance with him if she was elected?Originally, Lu Zhen thought these things were boring.But thinking about it now, it seems\u2026not impossible.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, stared at the screen for a long time, and then cast a vote for Chu Yin.No one paid attention to the voting page. The whole school was just waiting for the results.But at this time, there was a person in the school\u2019s flower voting section quietly beginning to soar\u2026Half an hour later, the voting system was officially closed, and a notification push was automatically sent to the students\u2019 mobile phones.Lu Zhen unconsciously took the mobile phone and checked the message.At the same time, all the students of Huiwen Private Middle School had entered the page.\u201cDang dang dang! After the public voting of the students, the school\u2019s apollo and the school\u2019s flower are now born!~\u201d\u201cSchool\u2019s Apollo \u2013 Second year, international class, Lu Zhen. \u201c\u201cSchool\u2019s Flower \u2013 Second year, Class 5\u2026 \u201cLu Zhen\u2019s lips curled as he looked down\u201cSong Zhaolin. \u201cLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026?\u201dThe whole school: \u201c???\u201dAt this time, after Chu Yin changed her fate, she finally laid down peacefully with a lazy posture.\u3010At the last moment, Song Zhaolin, like a dark horse, suddenly emerged from the fault and was elected as the school flower!\u3011What a passionate sentence that she wrote with her own hand~Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 \u2013 Guardian Knight (1)\u201cSong Zhaolin, you are shameless!!!\u201d\u201cDo you know no shame after swiping1your name in the selection!!!\u201dyour name in the selection!!!\u201d\u201cAre you so eager to win the school\u2019s flower title?\u201dThat night, Song Zhaolin\u2019s mobile phone \u2018dididi\u20192\u00a0was blown up by his classmates and friends.He looked confused: Swipe my name? I am not! I didn\u2019t!!Song Zhaolin was popular. He hangs out with both the wealthy kids of the family and kids from ordinary families. So, when the news of his winning reached their mobile phones, a bunch of people sent him a message and teased him about his crimes.Song Zhaolin, who was gloriously elected this year\u2019s school\u2019s flower, was in a daze for a long time.After that, he looked in the mirror and stared at his fairly delicate eyes. He thought shyly:\u00a0\u2018Damn, I actually crushed Sister Yin?\u2019Not a few seconds after the idea floated, he slapped himself:\u00a0\u201cPah! you deserve the slap!\u201cI can\u2019t compare to Sister Yin\u2019s beauty!So why on earth?? He didn\u2019t swipe the votes himself. The forum\u2019s mechanism did not allow voting frauds. Only the students of Huiwen had the right to vote. Each person had only one account.Did someone change his fate at the last moment and made him the school\u2019s flower?? Who loves him so much??Among the people, Tan Ke was the one who laughed the most. As the one who nominated Song Zhaolin\u2019s name in the school\u2019s flower, he never expected that his brother\u00a03\u00a0would actually be chosen as the school\u2019s flower.Tan Ke laughed all night before remembering that his other brother also won as the school\u2019s apollo. He sent a WeChat to Song Zhaolin: [Linzi, now that you are officially paired with Brother Zhen, you can be his dance partner hahahaha]Song Zhaolin\u2019s replied: [Will I still be alive tonight? *panic* *panic*]Tan Ke: [Brother, I suggest you hurry up and save yourself.][Not only to Brother Zhen but also to Chu Yin. She should have been elected but you got involved. Don\u2019t you need to apologize? ]Song Zhaolin: [Tang Ke! you are still thoughtful!! *flying kiss*]So, he sincerely sent a WeChat message to Lu Zhen: [Brother Zhen, I swear to God, I have no irreconcilable desire for you! I didn\u2019t mean to be the school\u2019s flower!!]After sending it, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t respond for a long time. Song Zhaolin waited for a while before sending a follow-up message: [Brother Zhen?]At last, there was a reaction: the message was sent, but it was rejected by the other partyThis time, he finally got a response: [Your message has been sent, but it was rejected by the other party.]Song Zhaolin: QAQ!He opened the dialog box of Chu Yin with heartache: [Sister Yin, I really didn\u2019t mean to. In my heart, you will always be the most beautiful school flower [crying] [crying]]He thought that Chu Yin would also block him, but her attitude was very gentle, opposite to what he was thinking.Chu Yin: [Lin Lin, be confident, you deserve it.]Song Zhaolin: ?? Why did he suddenly felt moved and wanted to cry?He didn\u2019t expect his Sister Yin to look cold on the surface, but was actually very warm-hearted!Chu Yin: guilty.jpgWhen Song Zhaolin went to school the next day, he was distinctly aware of the students\u2019 heads turning back to him.The usually self-confident and sunny bright young man walked shyly with his hands together.After finally arriving in Class 5, he saw Chu Yin already sitting in her seat, studying. She usually didn\u2019t give Song Zhaolin a look whenever he entered the class, but today, she actually raised her head and looked at Zhaolin for the first time.In Chu Yin\u2019s eyes, there was a deep meaning of wanting to laugh but couldn\u2019t. She concealed her guilty heart by looking at him with brighter eyes than usual, which made Song Zhaolin\u2019s subconsciously stood up.She reached out to help Song Zhaolin open the chair: \u201cSit.\u201dSong Zhaolin was flattered \u2014 is this the treatment of being a school\u2019s flower?! Does it seem\u2026seem to be a little bit cool?Chu Yin suppressed her slightly disturbed conscience and tried not to laugh.The permission to change the sentence stipulated that she could only find targets among the contestants of the same category and carefully thought about it yesterday. Although she could make Fu Mingxuan or Chu Qiuqiu win the school\u2019s flower, judging from the overall plot of the novel, once these two wins the title, they would certainly become a demon. Doing this would just more trouble for her.After many considerations, Song Zhaolin was the most suitable candidate. It won\u2019t lead to war and could even add a comic effect to the plot. Killing two birds with one stone \u2013 she was simply an artist \u221aAs more students came into the class, the first thing they did when entering was to look at Song Zhaolin.\u201cShit, Lin Zi, you are awesome!\u201d\u201cNow you\u2019re on fire!\u201d\u201cThe authorities said there was no abnormal data. It might be a system malfunction? Anyways, you are going to be recorded in the history of Huiwen!\u201dChu Yin lowered his eyes with a guilty heart, looked at his nose and nose, and studied with his heart, without being moved by foreign objects.Chu Yin lowered her eyes, guiltily. With this pose, she looked like a foreign goddess.When the boys in the class looked at Song Zhaolin, they would inevitably see Chu Yin next to him.The girl who was lowering her head with her hair draped down that covered her delicate eyebrows looked very ethereal as she sat by the window.When they saw this, the boys blushed.If the system didn\u2019t break down, she should be the school flower now. No one knew that many of them voted for Chu Yin.So when Fu Mingxuan came in, they hurriedly looked away. They didn\u2019t dare to look at Fu Mingxuan. After all, they agreed to vote for her.After Fu Mingxuan entered the classroom, she first looked at Song Zhaolin and was relieved to see that he was safe and sound.Yesterday, right after the school was over, Chu Yin still held the first rank in the vote. Fu Mingxuan was so angry that she asked her friends in the neighboring school to scare the school\u2019s flower. She wanted to scare her so she won\u2019t act too ostentatious in the future.These nearby schools all knew that Huiwen\u2019s girls were famous for their rich beauty, so they always paid close attention to the annual school\u2019s flower and school\u2019s apollo. Fu Mingxuan gave them money, of course, they did not refuse.After explaining the matter, Fu Mingxuan covered her face and sneaked away. Who knew that things suddenly reversed at night, Chu Yin didn\u2019t become a school flower?!Although Fu Mingxuan was happy to see the result, she was a little worried about an incident.I\u2019m sure those girls aren\u2019t that stupid\u2026At the same moment.In the Internet bar opposite the school, several girls in a middle school uniform with heavy make-up opened the homepage of Huiwen Middle School.\u201cThis year, their school\u2019s apollo is still Lu Zhen? Ah~ envy~\u201d\u201cSecond is Gu Qiuze? He can be our school\u2019s apollo.\u201d\u201d *wiping saliva* Today, we should focus on the school\u2019s flower.\u201dAs their mouse scrolled down, a few heads squeezed in front of the screen: \u201cSong Zhaolin?\u201d\u201cThere is no photo. How can we find her?\u201d\u201cForget it, let\u2019s just ask around. The school\u2019s flower must be very famous.\u201d***Lu Zhen was not in a good mood.Although he was lazy and indifferent as usual, Tan Ke, who was sitting across him, could feel it. It stood to reason that Lu Zhen had never been interested in things such as this.\u201cBrother Zhen, are you going to the dance?\u201d Tan Ke asked.Lu Zhen frowned and did not speak.Suddenly a figure came into the class. \u201cBrother Zhen ~ ~ Tang Ke ~ ~\u201dWhen Song Zhaolin came over, he met several friends on the way, winking at him.So when Song Zhaolin, who was full of passion, walked into the international class, Lu Zhen raised his hand and covered his eyes. Tan Ke also had a blank expression: \u201cYou\u2019re fucking normal!\u00a04\u201dSong Zhaolin sat down with a smile: \u201cI found that there\u2019s nothing wrong with being a school\u2019s flower!\u201dLu Zhen plainly looked at him while Tan Ke chuckled and said: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cI received a special treatment today. My deskmate pulled a chair for me, and she took the initiative to talk back to me. My god!\u201dLu Zhen suddenly raised his eyelids, his eyes were dark and heavy, and no one could see the lurking emotions behind them.Tan Ke, who was beside him, was quite surprised: \u201cReally? She didn\u2019t get angry and demanded to take her title?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cNo! She also told me that I deserve it. Hahaha.\u201dTan Ke also laughed: \u201chahaha\u201dLu Zhen also wanted to laugh.Song Zhaolin chatted for a while before asking, \u201cBrother Zhen, should we pick a song? I think everyone is looking forward to it.\u201dTan Ke laughed wildly \u2013 Although he\u2019s looking forward to it, he\u2019s afraid Song Zhaolin wouldn\u2019t live long.Lu Zhen raised his eyes, looked at him, and slowly spat out a word: \u201cRoll.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cOk\u2013\u201cThe school\u2019s flower came and went like a wind, leaving only a beautiful shadow.After sitting for a while, Lu Zhen suddenly got up. Tan Ke straightened up next to him: \u201cWhere to go?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t follow.\u201d Lu Zhen waved his hand.As soon as Lu Zhen left, the girls\u2019 conversation in the class became more unrestrained.\u201cHey, I feel sorry for our Brother Zhen~ he really doesn\u2019t to dance with Song Zhaolin?\u201d\u201cI think this result is very good, hahaha, I think he\u2019s suitable than anyone.\u201d\u201cI think so. Chu Yin\u2019s face is okay, but in a wider perspective\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s too unsophisticated.\u201dAfter listening to it, some boys felt a sour smell coming to their faces.As for Chu Yin\u2019s face, as soon as they saw it, they couldn\u2019t think of anything else. Okay, that\u2019s the wider perspective!Lu Zhen left the classroom and subconsciously walked into the direction of Class 5, feeling inexplicable.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His heart felt like it was being scratched.Lu Zhen walked along the corridor, but before turning the corner, he suddenly heard Song Zhaolin\u2019s voice: \u201cSister, Sister Yin, are you really not coming to the dance party?\u201dLu Zhen stopped abruptly.After two seconds, Chu Yin\u2019s cold voice sounded: \u201cNo, it\u2019s not interesting. I want to study.\u201dThe corner of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips suddenly tilted slightly. It seems that she was also like this in front of others.\u201cBrother Zhen will go. Even if you don\u2019t want to see me dancing, don\u2019t you want to see a handsome man?\u201dLu Zhen subconsciously held his breath and waited for her answer.\u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d The sound was colder than before.Chu Yin was really lazy to go to the dance party. Song Zhaolin felt that his school\u2019s flower title was not clear, so he felt he had to take her to the dance party.She thought for a while before comforting Song Zhaolin: \u201cYou should be confident. In fact, you and Lu Zhen are quite compatible.\u201dSong Zhaolin looked horrified: \u201c?\u201dLu Zhen, who was separated by a wall: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin sincerely said, \u201cThis type of CP should rise. If two people who are originally inappropriate, forcibly got paired up, would develop their feelings for each other. What\u2019s more, you two have known each other since childhood, right?\u201dSong Zhaolin had a dull face.This was the first time Lu Zhen heard her say so many words.The girl\u2019s voice was sweet and clear, but Lu Zhen felt it was painful to hear.Chu Yin sowed the seeds of love in Song Zhaolin\u2019s heart and left him with satisfaction, leaving Song Zhaolin alone to reshape his three views.Lu Zhen walked around the corner with a cold face. Song Zhaolin saw him and was shocked. Then he quickly proved his innocence: \u201cI don\u2019t have feelings. Brother Zhen, I really don\u2019t have it!\u201dLu Zhen didn\u2019t look at him but looked in the direction of where Chu Yin left. She would probably pass by the stairwell and go to the rooftop to review. Lu Zhen turned around and went up the stairs on the other side and waited for her in the stairwell.Song Zhaolin thought anxiously:\u00a0It\u2019s over! After Brother Zhen heard those words just now, he probably hates Sister Yin even more!Chu Yin drank water first, then memorized the words as she walked to the roof.As soon as she went up the stairs, she saw Lu Zhen.Xueji \u201cIt must be a special fate.\u201dChu Yin mercilessly said, \u201cGo away.\u201dThe dog man leaned against the wall, playing with his mobile phone as if he didn\u2019t notice her.From this angle, she could just see the brown-red tear mole. The proportion of his side face was accurate and perfect as if Lu Zhen had deliberately found a good angle.But Chu Yin was completely unmoved, thinking: Bad luck. I really want to change my path.However, at this time, it would be too obvious to turn around and change the script on the spot. She simply walked over intending to ignore him.At that moment she passed by, she heard him chuckled. Lu Zhen raised his head from his mobile phone: \u201cNot saying hello?\u201dChu Yin: Hello??Why do I have to say hello?? Are we familiar??Fortunately, she was a civilized person, otherwise, I will greet you and your family!\u00a01The stairwell was not big and there were only two of them. Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes fell on her eyes and he could her instant surprise as well as her slight frown.Chu Yin adhered to the rule that her character should not collapse. After a few seconds, Chu Yin said obediently, \u201cHello.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyes trembled slightly.In the unmanned stairwell, the girl holding the water glass was forced to say hello.It\u2019s the kind of nerd Lu Zhen hates, but it felt so\u2026good.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know what the dog man was thinking.But she was thinking that if she didn\u2019t act dull enough, she could only pretend to be demented.\u201cAnything else?\u201d she continued in a flat tone. It meant she was busy.The emotions in Lu Zhen\u2019s heart suddenly dissipated before quickly recovering.She hates him so much.Even if she tried to hide it, it still seems that every pore in her whole body repels him.The young man restrained his emotions and stepped back: \u201cNothing else.\u201dChu Yin secretly observed Lu Zhen\u2019s emotions that had faded down. She was suddenly relieved.The story really changed. From the initial so-called love at first sight, to later Lu Zhen began to chase her, these things did not happen again.After all, Lu Zhen at this time was just a 17-year-old boy and didn\u2019t have the abnormal developments yet. As the heir to a top company, Lu Zhen was undoubtedly a proud person. He wouldn\u2019t have the personality to pay attention to a little bookworm who he didn\u2019t like.Chu Yin felt a little peaceful. Without stopping, she turned around and went up the stairsLu Zhen watched her leave without a trace of pause.It was said that this was the case for smart and beautiful women. They only had their own goals in mind and would not be shaken by anything else.If she can\u2026Then he hoped she would always be like this, to everyone.Don\u2019t be swayed by anyone. Don\u2019t be enthusiastic about anyone.Even as the morning passed, Chu Yin was not persuaded by Song Zhaolin and still refused to participate in the dance party.At noon, Song Zhaolin said that he didn\u2019t want to eat in the cafeteria and wanted to eat out. As soon as he asked, Jiang Yan came over to ask a question. After Jiang Yan spoke, they went to the cafeteria for dinner together.Song Zhaolin: Sure enough, the treatment of being a school\u2019s flower is short-lived.Both Chu Yin and Jiang Yan were busy talking about school-related concerns as they went to the cafeteria.After chatting for a while, Jiang Yan sighed and pushed her glasses: \u201cYour logical thinking is very good. No wonder you got the perfect score in Mathematics. You\u2019re so intelligent.\u201dIn fact, Chu Yin\u2019s logic was very poor. She was tortured by GMAT in her last life. In terms of logic, Lu Zhen, that dog man, beat her.\u201cYour framework is also very good,\u201d Chu Yin also admired her, \u201cYour knowledge in comprehensive literature is so strong.\u201dThis was the case with the student who studied very hard, especially in the comprehensive subjects. Their knowledge framework was very clear in every book and lessons. Chu Yin admired this very much.In her last life, she had never communicated with an intelligent student in Huiwen. This time, after she improved herself, she was able to interact with different people.Jiang Yan shook her head. The more she communicated with Chu Yin, the more she could feel the gap. Chu Yin and her knowledge level were obviously not in the same line and the same problem. Chu Yin\u2019s thinking was much broader than her own.But Jiang Yan was not envious. She knew that Chu Yin worked harder than herself. She felt that she deserved it and could herself to exert more effort.On the way to the cafeteria, they would pass by the school gate. Jiang Yan was talking when she suddenly caught a few girls standing at the gate. They were obviously not Huiwen students.She pulled Chu Yin\u2019s sleeve and motioned for her to look over.As soon as Chu Yin\u2019s eyes looked over, she recognized that this was the student in the neighboring school. These people would come to the gate of Huiwen from time to time.Sometimes they were looking for handsome men, sometimes they were looking for trouble.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Don\u2019t look at them.\u201d Chu Yin said.Jiang Yan naturally agreed: \u201cOkay.\u201dWhen Chu Yin walked past, one of the girls saw her and quickly pulled her. \u201cCrap. This girl is so beautiful.\u201dWhen her companions looked over, they only saw the backs of the two figures. It was obvious that they were nerds.\u201cWhat beautiful?\u201d\u201cNo, really! The girl on the left is so beautiful! She has the face of first love. She is not the school flower, is she?\u201dThe companion frowned, casually pulled a boy out, and asked, \u201cClassmate, let me ask you something.\u201dThe boy was quite knowledgeable about current affairs: \u201cGo ahead.\u201dThe girl was very satisfied: \u201cWho is Song Zhaolin?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dWas he now famous enough to be blocked at the school gate? And several girls??Song Zhaolin shook his hair and showed a handsome smile: \u201cClassmate, what can I do for you?\u201d\u2026\u2026Twenty minutes later.Song Zhaolin\u2019s clothes were disheveled as he left with a dazed expression.Several girls teased and bullied him in the alley. They felt that they had done a good job with the money given to them.\u201cSo Huiwen is playing around this year? Is the school flower a man?\u201d\u201cSeeing that he has a good temper, why will he be in enmity with others?\u201d\u201cBlocking other people\u2019s way?\u201dWhen several girls walked out of the alley with a smile, they suddenly heard a warm and soft voice: \u201cExcuse me, are you looking for Huiwen\u2019s school\u2019s flower?\u201dWhen they saw that it was a well-dressed Bai Fu Mei, the sister with heavy make-up said arrogantly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are you the school\u2019s flower?\u201dJust now Chu Qiuqiu happened to pass by and heard them say, \u201cSomeone asked us to warn the school flowers.\u201dShe probably guessed what was going on.\u201cYou found the wrong person,\u201d Chu Qiuqiu covered her mouth and laughed carefully. \u201cThe original school flower is the one who ranked second. Her name is Chu Yin.\u201dSeveral girls felt that their sponsor wouldn\u2019t be satisfied with their job of looking for trouble with a boy.\u201cWhat does Chu Yin look like?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She wears baggy school uniform.\u201d\u201cDamn, isn\u2019t that the girl I saw just now?\u201d\u201cDo you remember the face?\u201d\u201cRemember. Her face can\u2019t simply be forgotten!\u201dChu Qiuqiu disclosed important information in a few words. She looked around and left. She was very happy when thinking that someone would go make trouble for Chu Yin.Although Chu Yin had a high number of votes, she didn\u2019t become the school\u2019s flower in the end. Yesterday\u2019s message board was right. If Chu Yin was chosen as the school\u2019s flower, the neighboring schools would mock them for choosing a country bumpkin.What\u2019s more, they were in a wealthy and powerful family. Apart from a face, Chu Yin did not qualify for a wealthy upbringing. How could she be a school flower?Chu Qiuqiu was in a good mood. She bought milk tea outside the school and went back to school as if nothing had happened. She met Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze on the way.\u201cBrother and Senior Qiuze\u201d Chu Qiuqiu said hello sweetly.Chu Shi looked at her back: \u201cHow can you be alone?\u201d Usually, Chu Qiuqiu went everywhere with her best friends.Chu Qiuqiu was surprised. When she saw Song Zhaolin being dragged to the alley, she separated from her friends. But her elder brother certainly did not see this scene, so she would not take the initiative to tell him that someone wanted to trouble Chu Yin.\u201cThey don\u2019t want to drink milk tea today.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Chu Shi didn\u2019t ask anymore, \u201cGo back to class.\u201dChu Qiuqiu left quickly.Gu Qiuze looked at Chu Shi, \u201cLooking carefully, they don\u2019t look alike.\u201dChu Shi squinted at him: \u201cWhat is?\u201d\u201cShe and Chu Yin,\u201d Gu Qiuze laughed, \u201cThe gap is a little obvious.\u201dChu Shi sighed slightly and did not deny it.The Chu family\u2019s attitude on this matter was very vague and had not publicly clarified the identity of Chu Yin and Chu Qiuqiu, only saying that they were the daughters of the Chu family.But this was full of flaws. The Chu parents did not want to hurt the two daughters, but it would still hurt them in the end. At least from his point of view, his biological sister did not have a trace of attachment to this family.He was afraid that Chu Yin also didn\u2019t have any attachment to her former home. She lived alone in the world without family for so many years\u2026Chu Shi looked at Gu Qiuze again and sighed: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can rely on you in the future.\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c?\u201dChu Shi continued to say, \u201cEven you can\u2019t compete with Lu Zhen in the school\u2019s apollo selection. What is your use?\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c? I already lost last year, okay.\u201dChu Shi: \u201cOh, but Yin Yin didn\u2019t become a school flower. You are both in second.\u201dGu Qiuze felt like he was implying something.The lunch break was over.***When Chu Yin came back from lunch, Song Zhaolin was thinking about life on his seat.After what happened just now, he thought:\u00a0Is the burden of beauty too heavy for him?Chu Yin looked at him: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dSong Zhaolin looked at Chu Yin in a trance: \u201cSister Yin, am I beautiful enough for people to come at me?\u201d\u201cTo what extent?\u201d Chu Yin askedSong Zhaolin touched his face: \u201cTo the extent of being pulled to the level of molestation in the alley.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin suddenly felt guilty: \u201cIs it because of your school\u2019s flower title?\u201dSong Zhaolin nodded with pity: \u201cYes.\u201dChu Yin was more guilty.Could the side effects of school\u2019s flower halo still work on boys??It\u2019s too retarded, isn\u2019t it?? It\u2019s really the world of fiction.Chu Yin coughed twice and patted Song Zhaolin on the shoulder: \u201cNo, you are not as beautiful as that.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s just that fate is too ruthless.Song Zhaolin pitifully went to Chu Yin\u2019s table: \u201cMy heart is so cold.\u201dChu Yin comforted him: \u201cDon\u2019t do this, Dad loves you.\u201dSong Zhaolin took the opportunity to say, \u201cSo do you have the heart to refuse me to attend the dance party?\u201dChu Yin finally found her conscience: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll go.\u201dSong Zhaolin was happy.In fact, those girls were not too much. It was just his first time to meet this kind of battle. He was just a little scared.\u00a0But why did Sister Yin look guilty? It has nothing to do with her.Hee hee hee, she is such a kind little angel.\u2026\u2026After school, Chu Yin sat in the classroom as usual to answer questions.\u201cDing \u2013 political test paper 97 points, task completed \u221a access to [change word] permission. \u201c\u201cHost, do you want to unlock the script?~\u201dChu Yin received the pen: \u201cOkay.\u201dThe script spread out, and Chu Yin held her arms as she looked at it. After a few glance, she thought to herself:\u00a0Although the plot of school\u2019s flower has been tampered with by her, the plot is still quietly progressing.She didn\u2019t know the identity of the little devil that wanted to punish her but got Song Zhaolin by mistake. But under the function of cannon fodders, this group would eventually look for trouble with her.Now, if Chu Yin went out, those people would gather around and take her to the alley to teach her.Chu Yin had not experienced this kind of mentally handicapped operation in her previous life, and now she felt suffocated.\u201cHost, maybe you can choose to leave through the back door of the school?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s calmly responded as she opened her geography exercise book: \u201cWe\u2019re not in a hurry. Let\u2019s make them stay for a while.\u201dShe had already told the family driver to come back later to pick her up. The people outside would have to wait for a long time.When Chu Yin finally came out of the school, the people waiting outside were almost hungry.\u201cCome on, come on, she\u2019s coming!\u201d\u201cAre you sure it\u2019s her?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s her!\u201dChu Yin took a look at them, and then went straight to the alley opposite the school. Several girls were dumbfounded and followed her subconsciously.On the way, Chu Yin opened the voice memo of the mobile phone. When they got there, she\u00a0 asked them, \u201cDid you bully a man named Song Zhaolin in our school at noon?\u201dThe leader laughed: \u201cThat handsome boy?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cDon\u2019t you want to apologize?\u201dThe girls puffed up their chewing gum and thought that she was mentally ill: \u201cIt\u2019s just a boy. We\u2019re just making fun of him. It will not happen again.\u201dThey admitted it.Chu Yin held the mobile phone in her pocket, and then said, \u201cSo boys can be harassed at will? Reflect on yourselves if you think it\u2019s not disgusting to have no conscience.\u201dThey argued back, \u201cYou have a long mouth, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cLittle girl, this sister will teach you how to be a man today!\u201dThese girls, who were mixed up in society\u00a01, didn\u2019t pay attention to Chu Yin at all. They picked up something on the ground and began to walk over to her.Chu Yin was not flustered. She had a script in front of her.[Several girls picked up bricks from the ground and planned to gather around Chu Yin. Chu Yin didn\u2019t shrink back. With her strength, she could get rid of these people. ]\u201cHost, it\u2019s still dangerous to attack them directly. This system suggests that you weaken the lethality of their weapons first.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWho said I\u2019m going to do it?\u201dThe purpose of Chu Yin\u2019s trip was to punish those cannon fodders that used violence. After all, these people had not made any progress even in their two lives. They constantly do things stupid things.Now that the recording was over and gained evidence, she just needed to finish them off.Chu Yin asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I let their weapons kill them?\u201dXueji: \u201cHow to kill?\u201d\u201cChicken, your imagination is still poor.\u201dAs she spoke, she moved her light pen and scratched out [brick], and changed it into [dog-poop].Xueji: \u201c\u2026.\u201dChu Yin: it\u2019s good to win without fighting.Several girls surrounded her with evil smiles, trying to show this ignorant person the difference between them.Suddenly, the slender and beautiful girl in front of her gave a disgusting \u201cYuck.\u201d\u201cYou are so disgusting,\u201d she said with a frown, \u201cplaying with poop.\u201d\u201cWho do you mean play?\u201dBefore their voice fell, the leader of the group suddenly smelled a stinky odor.When they turned their head to see, their one hand unexpectedly held a steaming dog poop?!Too close, too much detail, too shining, and the impact is too strong.Because of their hunger and their nauseous feeling mixed up, the acid rushed to their throat, making them collapse on the spot.A few younger girls ignored their nausea and quickly threw the dog poop.One of the people pinched the girls and said, \u201cElder sister, wake up! are you all right? Wake up!\u201dThe elder sister finally woke up. As soon as she opened her eyes, the little sister\u2019s hand that formerly touched the dog poop was on her mouth.She gave a more intense \u201cvomit -\u201d sound and fell completely unconscious.Chu Yin clapped her hands and said, \u201cBy the way, the school flower is actually the one who asked you to come to me. Next time you see her, remember not to let her go. \u201cSeveral younger sisters were about to cry: \u201cThen who are you?\u201d\u201cMe?\u201d Chu Yin touched her pocket and walked out of the alley, \u201cI am the Guardian Knight of the School\u2019s flower.\u201d\u2014\u2014Song Zhaolin, the best school\u2019s flower in the world!

Maybe she was being taught a lesson right now. They might also be annoyed by Chu Yin\u2019s stinky temper. Chu Yin might even get even a few beatings from them.It would be more exciting if they could scratch her face~Chu Shi just went downstairs when he saw the excited Chu Qiuqiu. His eyebrows raised, \u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201dChu Qiuqiu was startled: \u201cNo, nothing!\u201dChu Shi thought she was a little strange. He looked her up and down.Chu Qiuqiu quickly made up a reason: \u201cThis is\u2026I\u2019m about to pick out a dress for the dance party. I haven\u2019t ordered a formal dress for a long time.\u201dSpeaking of this, Chu Shi thought of Chu Yin. After all, she grew up in the countryside and probably didn\u2019t know anything about these luxury items. Seeing that she usually wears a simple school uniform, she may not know how to choose a dress for this dance party occasion.Chu Shi: \u201cYou\u2026\u201dHe just wanted to ask Chu Qiuqiu to help Chu Yin, but after thinking about it, he swallowed the words back. He should wait for Xiao Yin to come back and help her pick a dress together.Chu Qiuqiu glanced at Chu Shi\u2019s expression and immediately flattered him: \u201cBrother, don\u2019t worry. I will help sister pick a dress for the dance party.\u201dChu Shi nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dAfter a while, the gate of the Chu house finally opened, and the car that picked up Chu Yin came in.Chu Qiuqiu controlled her excited expression and looked forward to the dark-faced Chu Yin coming in.Who knew that the girl who walked in was calm, her clothes were clean, and she didn\u2019t even have a scratch on her body, let alone a wound.What\u2019s going on? Those people didn\u2019t wait for Chu Yin?? Chu Qiuqiu was a little dumbfounded for a moment and hadn\u2019t controlled her disappointed expression.Chu Yin glanced at her.What a good sister Chu Qiuqiu is.Chu Shi came over and said, \u201cDid you arrive so late just to study?\u201dChu Yin shook her head: \u201cI met some strange people on the way. I thought they were going to trouble me.\u201dChu Qiuqiu quickly pricked up her ears.Chu Shi frowned: \u201cWhat strange people? What have they done to you?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s pair of peach blossom eyes slightly curved: \u201cNothing \u2013 they seem to be mentally retarded. I only said two words and they suddenly squatted on the ground to play with dog poop.\u201dChu Qiuqiu: \u201c\u2026\u201d Are those girls retarded?Chu Shi was also silent for a moment. After all, he was the eldest young master of a powerful family, and he had never seen anything like this. \u201cStay away from these people next time. \u201cChu Yin said with a smile: \u201cI know. It seems that they got lied to by a female student at Huiwen at noon and wanted revenge. I told them to remember her face clearly so they don\u2019t approach the wrong person. \u201cChu Qiuqiu\u2019s body shivered and she almost fell off the sofa.What?? Those\u00a0 half-witted skanks are going to take revenge on her?!And they\u2019re moronic idiots that play with dog poop! She doesn\u2019t want it!!!\u2026\u2026After dinner, a designer came to the door and brought an album of the season\u2019s\u00a0couture\u00a0dresses.Chu Qiuqiu gained her energy back.Chu Shi chose his outfit easily. He had a brand he was used to wearing. He had been buying an outfit from them every season. So, today\u2019s focus was to choose dresses for his two sisters.Chu Yin hadn\u2019t been interested in these things in her previous life. But after staying with Lu Zhen for a long time, she was accustomed to the luxury of the top class. These expensive things seemed to have no value in her eyes.The Chu family\u2019s financial resources were not enough.Although she\u2019d much rather go home to do a few sets of questions than going to a dance, she couldn\u2019t since she had promised Song Zhaolin.It was certainly not a good decision to go. She could only pick a dress that wouldn\u2019t let her stand out.Chu Shi was afraid of hurting Chu Yin. He didn\u2019t rush to help his sister to choose. He planned to wait for Chu Yin to finish reviewing the dresses before giving suggestions based on her choice.Chu Qiuqiu watched as her brother walked to one side, holding the brochures of several luxury brands. She sat next to Chu Yin affectionately, \u201cSister, don\u2019t you know these brands? I\u2019ll help you pick them~\u201dChu Yin moved to the side a little disgusted. Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s attitude was superfluous.The style and tailoring were very simple. The sleeves reached the wrist. The mid-length skirt hid a little playfulness to it, which was very suitable for her current age.Although she didn\u2019t want to admit it, Chu Yin knew that her sense of fashion was influenced by the dog man Lu Zhen. When she was brought back from the countryside, although she had her fashion style, it was not very high-level.That\u2019s why the dog man thought that the floral dress\u00a01\u00a0was ugly.Chu Yin was a little distracted when Chu Qiuqiu had enthusiastically selected one of the pictures for her: \u201cElder sister, I think this is quite suitable for you, this color is very cute, it will attract the male students~\u201dChu Yin looked at the bright pink, vulgar slit skirt: \u201c\u2026.\u201dThen she changed her advice from a bright pink dress into a fluorescent yellow dress. She enthusiastically recommended it to her, \u201cSister, this is also good. It will match your skin tone~\u201dChu Yin nodded and stopped Chu Shi who was walking by, \u201cBrother, I have chosen.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take this one,\u201d She pointed to the black dress she had just seen, and then her fingertips moved to the two hot-eyed dresses. \u201cMy sister likes these two and you must buy them for her.\u201dChu Qiuqiu was stunned for a moment and even said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\u2013\u201cChu Yin interrupted her: \u201cNo? But you said it\u2019s very cute, can attract the boys, and it matches the skin color?\u201dChu Shi looked at the photo and was surprised. Chu Yin picked a very good dress, but when he saw the two dresses behind, his questioning eyes fell on Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face.\u201cChu Qiuqiu, your taste is quite unique.\u201dChu Qiuqiu: \u201c\u2026\u201dIn the evening, Chu Yin arranged the recordings from her mobile phone and sent them to the Academic Affairs Office of the neighboring school.The neighboring school had a good education. Their college entrance examination scores were better than Huiwen\u2019s. There were many talented and bright students. Because it was a big school, there were many different students enrolled. The gangsters in that school assumed the role of various cannon fodders that were used as tools in the novel. Because of that, Chu Yin suffered a lot in her last life.Fortunately, the management of that school was very strict, and it was never soft-hearted to the students who caused trouble.The next day, when Song Zhaolin passed by the neighboring school, he saw a notice of punishment posted on the board at the gate.After he arrived in class, he said to Chu Yin, who had started studying, \u201cI found that there is justice in this world.\u201dChu Yin did not lift her head: \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYesterday those lecherous \u2013 no, those hooligans were punished by their school,\u201d Song Zhaolin touched his little chest, \u201cI\u2019m so moved.\u201dChu Yin stopped writing and looked up at him.Song Zhaolin inexplicably saw a kind of kindness in her eyes.\u201cIt is everyone\u2019s responsibility to love and protect a school\u2019s flower.\u201d Chu Yin was like a loving father.Song Zhaolin felt that it was necessary to revive his masculinity. Although his Sister Yin was not interested in him and had a little father-son relationship at most with him, he still wanted Chu Yin to remember that he was a handsome man.Song Zhaolin touched his hair: \u201cYou must come to the dance, I will do a good job stunning everyone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Chu Yin clapped her hands perfunctorily, \u201cYou will dance with the school\u2019s apollo?\u201dSong Zhaolin almost burst out: \u201cNo way, I still want to live!!!\u201dChu Yin said earnestly: \u201cLove comes from this kind of contradictions. Don\u2019t resist it. Let the seeds of love grow naturally.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c???\u201d\u2026\u2026Two days later, the campus dance was held in the auditorium.Both Fu Mingxuan and Chu Qiuqiu were very keen on this kind of social occasion, so they were dressed very ceremoniously as if they were going to walk the red carpet.After all, they were also the school\u2019s flower candidates. Both of them were famous campus beauties, which attracted many people\u2019s attention.Lu Zhen was standing on the second floor of the auditorium, leaning against the railing. He was drinking wine in a glass, looking lazily across the hall.The party was hosted by Yu Lin, a junior in senior high school. The Yu family and the Lu family merged through marriages a long time ago. Yu Lin was his cousin.\u201cThere are so many little beauties in your grade,\u201d Yu Lin stood beside him, glancing around the stairs. \u201cI\u2019ll go down and play a few games later.\u201dLu Zhen was not interested and was too lazy to come. But, he was dragged by his cousin to come to this dance party to support him.\u201cAh Zhen, you don\u2019t want to dance?\u201d Yu Lin also knew Song Zhaolin, \u201cYou and Xiao Linzi should dance together. I can already see you in the hot search.\u201dLu Zhen said \u201cgo away\u201d coldly.Yu Lin, of course, knew his cousin\u2019s temper, so he didn\u2019t dare to persuade him. He continued to look at the beauties downstairs.After looking around, his breath got almost taken away, \u201cDamn, damn! So beautiful! I saw a fairy.\u201dThe door of the auditorium was pushed open and a girl came in quietly. She didn\u2019t arrange her face in any way, nor did she deliberately attract other people\u2019s attention. But, as long as people caught a glimpse of her, they could not move their eyes.Yu Lin pushed the unmoved Lu Zhen beside him, and said, \u201cDamn it, she\u2019s so beautiful. Is she the one from the Chu family?\u201dLu Zhen suddenly turned his head.Chapter 18 \u2013 Come and Dance (2)He didn\u2019t need to look around because he found Chu Yin at first glance.He didn\u2019t meet Chu Yin often at school and hadn\u2019t seen her for several days. Even if he met her by chance, she would just ignore him if he didn\u2019t speak.Chu Yin didn\u2019t wear her school uniform today. Instead, She wore a black dress with her long hair draped down. It was a low-key dress, but for the crowd, it looked conspicuous.Not only Lu Zhen, but also countless people were watching her at the ball.Yu Lin was still staring at her: \u201cApollo, Xiao Linzi owes you a beating. This should be the school\u2019s flower, okay?\u201dLu Zhen suddenly frowned. He put down the wine glance and went downstairs.After Chu Yin came in, she went directly to the seat on one side. She intended to sit for a while before leaving, to give her deskmate some face. Although she sat down soon, she did not intend to waste time. After sitting down, she memorized the system task in her heart.In the distance, Zheng Yu felt excited and drank a glass of wine after he saw Chu Yin.Zheng Yu was very confident in himself. He had a good family background. He was also chased around by many girls.Although Chu Yin was beautiful and a little unsophisticated, Zheng Yu thought it should not be difficult to win her. After all, she grew up in a small village and had less knowledge. He guessed it wouldn\u2019t be long for Chu Yin to fall for him.Zheng Yu put down his glass and straightened his clothes. He was about to go forward when he saw Lu Zhen walking past.He walked in a circle and went back to where he had been.\u2014\u2014Excuse me.Chu Yin was memorizing the text in her heart when suddenly a cold voice reached her ears: \u201cWeren\u2019t you not going to come?\u201dWhen she lifted her eyes, she bumped into Lu Zhen\u2019s cold eyes.The light in the corner was dim. Although Lu Zhen tried to restrain himself, his eyes uncontrollably fell on her face\u2013from her forehead to her lips. Her natural beauty had a trace of a subtle charm. Even just sitting quietly was very attractive.An indescribable restlessness haunted his heart.Chu Yin could see that he was a little annoyed.She thought to herself:\u00a0Oh, dog man is pretty handsome today??You knew I wasn\u2019t coming? Does it matter to you whether I come or not??Although Chu Yin scolded him in her heart, she still spoke cautiously, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyes suddenly sank.Her voice was soft as if she had a good temper. She wasn\u2019t curious about him and didn\u2019t even ask him why he knew she wouldn\u2019t come. She only apologized just to get rid of him.As Lu Zhen\u2019s jaw tightened, many thoughts lingered in that passing instant.But in the end, he coldly said, \u201cThis place is not for you. Go back early.\u201dWith that, the young man left coldly.Chu Yin: \u201c?\u201dLu Zhen got angry at her? Dog man found her annoying?Oh, my god. Isn\u2019t this a great thing?!If there were firecrackers right now, she would certainly be the first to light it!!The moment Lu Zhen walked downstairs, many girls in the auditorium paid attention to his movements. They felt sour at first when they saw him walking towards Chu Yin.But Lu Zhen left with an ugly expression after speaking two sentences.They were relieved.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you, Brother Zhen won\u2019t lower his taste so much!\u201d\u201cPeople who came from the village can\u2019t speak properly. She must have said something that shouldn\u2019t be said.\u201d\u201cIn the end, she only has her face. She\u2019s so boring that she only knows how to study. With this kind of person, Brother Zhen won\u2019t take a fancy to her.\u201dAfter Chu Qiuqiu listened to them, she said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d\u201cWow, Qiuqiu, is this dress from J\u2019s? It\u2019s so beautiful~\u201dChu Qiuqiu smiled gracefully and chatted with them.\u201cAh, is that Senior Zheng? He\u2019s coming!!\u201d\u201cQiuqiu, he seems to be coming towards you.\u201dAlthough Zheng Yu, a third-year senior, was not as good as Gu Qiuze, he was also a rich second generation. He was handsome. Many girls also voted for him in the selection.Chu Qiuqiu brushed her hair. When Zheng Yu called her, she turned around and showed a perfect smile with a slight surprise: \u201c\u2013Senior?\u201dZheng Yu had been thinking about Lu Zhen\u2019s actions just now, for fear that he was also interested in Chu Yin.Their Zheng family was not small, but compared with the Lu family, they were only a fraction of the size. Even if Lu Zhen was one level\u00a01\u00a0lower than him, he wouldn\u2019t dare to rob him.After thinking about it, Zheng Yu decided to ask Chu Yin\u2019s sister first.\u201cHello, sister.\u201d He said with a smileChu Qiuqiu guessed that he came to invite her to a dance, so she shyly lowered her eyes, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, senior?\u201dZheng Yu said, \u201cOh, I just want to ask, does your sister, Chu Yin, have a boyfriend?\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face stiffened. He came to her just to ask for Chu Yin?!How come everyone\u2019s in love with her? Don\u2019t they know that she came from the village with no proper education??Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s feelings of embarrassment and jealousy burned like fire. She controlled her expression and awkwardly smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe my sister has a boyfriend in the countryside?\u201dZheng Yu was relieved: \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long she doesn\u2019t have a boyfriend here.\u201dThose people in the countryside were nothing to be afraid of!Zheng Yu happily turned to find Chu Yin but found that she was no longer in her seat.The music suddenly began and some people were already on the dance floor. Chu Yin was pulled by Song Zhaolin to let her watch him dance.Song Zhaolin was good at dancing. He had practiced dancing since childhood.Chu Yin looked envious because she had no talent in this area.Lu Zhen also taught her how to dance, but after being trampled countlessly with her feet, he finally gave up.After Song Zhaolin finished dancing a song, several girls joined in to talk to him.Chu Yin was very pleased with his dancing and applauded him.Now that she had finished her task, she could leave after she found her Brother Chu Shi.Taking advantage of the time gap between the next music, Chu Yin planned to withdraw from the crowd.But at this time, she was suddenly slapped hard from behind, making her tumble on the dance floor.Chu Qiuqiu, with a sweet smile, pulled her to the center of the dance floor: \u201cSister~ let\u2019s dance together~\u201dChu Yin sighed: Damn you.There isn\u2019t a time where you don\u2019t make a fuss, don\u2019t you?After the midterm exams, her fake sister suddenly became quiet for a while. She was a little noisy at most, but it seems that her silence was temporary.As soon as Chu Yin\u2019s figure appeared on the dance floor, it immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cIs that Chu Yin from second-year Class 5?\u201d\u201cShe can dance?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. It looks like she can?\u201dLu Zhen was originally sitting on the second floor when he suddenly saw her being pulled into the dance floor. He subconsciously was about to stand up and go downstairs.Chu Qiuqiu pretended to be intimate, holding on to Chu Yin not to let her go. She made up her mind to make a fool of Chu Yin, and let everyone see her poor dance. Chu Yin couldn\u2019t compare with herself!Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to throw a fit in public, so she directly knocked on the system: \u201cUnlock the script.\u201d\u3010Venue: Huiwen\u2019s auditorium. Characters: Chu Yin, Chu Qiuqiu, Classmates.\u3011\u3010\u2026\u2026 Chu Qiuqiu believed that if Chu Yin was riding a tiger\u00a02\u00a0she couldn\u2019t leave because leaving the dance floor equals showing her timidity. Chu Qiuqiu decided to seize the opportunity to show her demeanor as a wealthy daughter.With the melodious music, Chu Qiuqiu danced gracefully, attracting the attention of the audience.\u3011Chu Yin was speechless:\u00a0You can do it yourself if you want to. Why do you have to pull others to be your sacrifice?Xueji reminded: \u201cDing! Host, do you want to use a prop card?\u201dChu Yin thought for a moment: \u201cNo need.\u201dShe took up her pen and used her artistic ability. After thinking for a second, she crossed out the word [ gracefully ] and changed it into [ snake-shape ] .Since you\u2019re not kind, don\u2019t blame me for giving you an injustice, sister.Soon, melodious music played in the auditorium.Chu Qiuqiu smiled, took a good pose, and was about to take the first step of dancing\u2013Suddenly, her body moved into an S shape.The person next to her was pushed away by her: \u201c??\u201dWho knew her next move was more sultry.Chu Qiuqiu was like a nimble snake. She moved in the form of a snake, taking the spotlight alone. Everyone was stunned and dumbfounded.Under Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s energetic and enthusiastic dance steps, all the people around her couldn\u2019t dance anymore.People silently vacated the whole dance floor for her.Chu Qiuqiu herself felt she was crazy.Why?Why can\u2019t I stop myself?!My feet! What\u2019s wrong with my feet?!!Following the crowd, Chu Yin quietly retreated, watching Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s expression gradually collapsed.The weather is beautiful. The rain has stopped. Do you think you can do it again?You can go and dance thenPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There was no dance class arranged for her at home. His sister probably didn\u2019t learn it when she was in the village, so she wouldn\u2019t be able to dance. How could she be on the dance floor? He guessed that Chu Qiuqiu was playing tricks again.Although Chu Yin was separated from them, he never regarded Chu Qiuqiu as a replacement for her. Even if it was like this, he also had loved Chu Qiuqiu. Looking at his grown-up sister, she seemed to be different from what he thought.Gu Qiuze looked at the situation on the dance floor and said in a low voice: \u201cThere are too many eyes. It won\u2019t be good.\u201dChu Shi didn\u2019t say anything and planned to go up to rescue Chu Yin.But at this time, the music had already started. A few seconds later, there was a commotion among the crowd.Then, they witnessed a spectacular shocking appearance.Chu Shi: \u201c\u2026\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026\u201dAll the students in the school: \u201c\u2026\u201dGu Qiuze was silent for a long time before hesitating to voice his thoughts,\u00a0 \u201cChu Qiuqiu is quite\u2026energetic.\u201dChu Shi covered his eyes in silence.\u2026No one taught Chu Qiuqiu to dance like this?!What\u2019s the matter with this snake-like dance???That night, Chu Qiuqiu got her wish and became the focus of the audience because of her dance.Chu Yin hid her merit deeply and walked out silently, walking past the crowd.Not far away, a hand holding a red rose suddenly stretched out of nowhere.Chu Yin was blocked. She raised her head inexplicably and saw an extremely coquettish face.Zheng Yu finally seized the opportunity to block her, put out the most handsome expression, and affectionately looked at the girl in front of him: \u201cHello, beautiful. I\u2019m Zheng Yu.\u201dThis ancient way of greeting, Chu Yin was embarrassed.She didn\u2019t have much experience of being chased by boys. The main reason was that Lu Zhen was always by her side. At the time of her high school, the boys didn\u2019t dare to take the initiative because Lu Zhen had already started chasing her.In this life, since there was no Lu Zhen by her side, some people were eager to take the initiative. Although this person named Zheng Yu, who stood in front of her, was like a peacock, showing its grand beauty, it also confirmed to her that the plot had changed.Therefore, Chu Yin was more patient, nodded, and said politely: \u201cHello.\u201dLu Zhen stood not far away and watched.He saw her leaving the dance floor as well as being stopped mid-way.Seeing a fool holding a rose, standing in front of her with an indecent smile.Lu Zhen subconsciously squeezed his fingers and his breath became deep and heavy.Are you foolish? If you don\u2019t know the person, you should stay away.What do you have to say to such a suave and insincere person?When Zheng Yu saw that Chu Yin\u2019s personality was gentle as she replied to him, his heart was filled with joy.\u201cHow can a beautiful woman be alone?\u201d He continued, \u201cThis travesty is most definitely all the gentlemen\u2019s present fault.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dSorry, I\u2019m going to throw up.But in Zheng Yu\u2019s eyes, the girl in front of him was just frowning her delicate eyebrows. Her beautiful eyes were shining with waves. He felt pity for her.Zheng Yu couldn\u2019t help but get closer and said, \u201cYou are really beautiful. Can you be my\u2026\u201dLu Zhen gazed at the shrinking distance between them. His expression became more and more ugly. Finally, he couldn\u2019t help it and walked forward.Chu Yin resisted the impulse to punch Zheng Yu\u2019s face and took a big step back: \u201cyou should sober up!\u201dZheng Yu narrowed his eyes and followed her: \u201cI\u2019m very sober~\u201dJust as Chu Yin began to think about whether to change the script, a warm voice came in, \u201cYou will only scare her.\u201dZheng Yu suddenly raised his head and saw that Gu Qiuze came and blocked Chu Yin from his view.Gu Qiuze\u2019s temperament was as warm as a breeze. His stature was tall. When he stood in front of him, Zheng Yu\u2019s aura was somehow weakened.Chu Yin was relieved. In this situation, she really didn\u2019t want to waste her permission to change words.Although Zheng Yu was a little upset, his family\u2019s standing was far worse than the Gu\u2019s. Gu Qiuze stood unmovingly, so Zheng Yu had no choice but to give a slightly flattering smile: \u201cI\u2019m just joking.\u201dGu Qiuze\u2019s smile was gentle, but his tone was irrefutable: \u201cIt\u2019s not funny.\u201dZheng Yu\u2019s expression was a little ugly, but he couldn\u2019t counterattack. Finally, he had to say \u201cwait for me\u201d to Chu Yin, then turned around and left dimly.Chu Yin: Who is waiting for you???Gu Qiuze turned around, bowed his head, and gave a smile: \u201cWere you scared?\u201dChu Yin pursed her lips: \u201cThank you. I was disgusted.\u201dGu Qiuze was taken aback. He was amused by her again.Originally, they (Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze) were afraid of the little girl coming in contact with boys. It was easy to be deceived by boys like Zheng Yu. But it appeared to be that her vision and taste were good and they didn\u2019t need to worry at all. Chu Yin was really a girl full of surprises.Chu Yin looked behind him: \u201cWhere\u2019s my brother?\u201dGu Qiuze raised his eyes, not far behind Chu Yin, Chu Shi was standing in front of Lu Zhen. Just now Chu Shi pushed him to take care of Chu Yin, and he went straight towards Lu Zhen.To tell you the truth, Gu Qiuze didn\u2019t know why Chu Shi hated Lu Zhen more than he did.In addition to Chu Shi\u2019s hatred, he also felt that he had an unspeakable fear towards him.When Lu Zhen was stopped by Chu Shi, Gu Qiuze had already stood in front of Chu Yin.An inexplicable feeling of being robbed of something important suddenly rose from the bottom of Lu Zhen\u2019s heart. He was irritated, \u201cDo you need something?\u201dChu Shi laughed. Since his sister and Lu Zhen were here at the same time, he must pay more attention. When he saw the bastard walking towards Chu Yin, he came immediately.\u201cNothing.\u201d said Chu Shi, \u201cIt seems that you are going in the direction of my sister. I\u2019m afraid you will cause unnecessary trouble.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s aura was very cold. He stared at him with dim eyes, \u201cIf you have something to say, speak up.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you the truth,\u201d Chu Shi looked at him. \u201cMy sister only has studies in her heart. She doesn\u2019t like you. I hope Young Master Lu doesn\u2019t have any ideas that he shouldn\u2019t have.\u201dLu Zhen smiled, revealing a hint of hostility.Shouldn\u2019t have thoughts?Before he could speak, Song Zhaolin came out of nowhere then said, \u201cBrother, you think too much. Brother Zhen doesn\u2019t have those kinds of ideas for Sister Yin!\u201dOf course, Chu Shi didn\u2019t want to have a conflict with Lu Zhen. He nodded his head and deeply looked at Lu Zhen before turning around to find his sister.At this time, the music just finished, and Yu Lin\u2019s slightly embarrassed voice boomed from the microphone.\u201cThe performance just now was\u2026.. excellent!!! Everyone, let\u2019s give each other a clap!\u201dSong Zhaolin clapped his hands and said with a smile, \u201cBrother Zhen, didn\u2019t you see it? Chu Qiuqiu seems to be crazy. To dance crazily like that, even her family won\u2019t recognize her.\u201dLu Zhen answered casually.Then Yu Lin\u2019s voice came from the stereo: \u201c\u2013Next up! It\u2019s the climax of the ball! Let\u2019s invite our school\u2019s flower and our school\u2019s apollo to dance together!\u201dSong Zhaolin was caught off guard: \u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s face was expressionlessAt this time, Song Zhaolin and Lu Zhen were standing together, and the eyes of the whole audience shot towards them.Both of them were handsome. One was the pretty kind, while the other was the cold kind.No one said it but they were all looking forward to it.Song Zhaolin gradually felt shy under the attention of the crowd. He touched his cheeks shyly.Lu Zhen raised his eyelids and expressed to Yu Lin with his eyes: Do you want to die?Yu Lin felt embarrassed by Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s dance just now, so he risked his life to pull Lu Zhen to liven up the atmosphere. Of course, it was impossible to make him dance.\u201cHa ha ha. Just kidding! Due to this year\u2019s special circumstances, the school\u2019s flower and school\u2019s apollo can no longer dance together~\u201d Yu Lin added. His desire for survival was, after all, strong.However, after such a disturbing performance, the atmosphere in the auditorium finally returned to normal. Chu Yin retracted her gaze and sighed a little regretfully.Before she finished sighing, she heard someone say, \u201c\u2013Then, why don\u2019t we invite\u00a0 the second rank school\u2019s flower and second rank school\u2019s apollo to dance together?\u201dGu Qiuze and Chu Yin, who was suddenly cued: \u201c?\u201dAnd the two of them happened to stand together. This time, fiery eyes shot over Yu Lin\u2019s direction.Lu Zhen\u2019s jaw tightened as he glared at Yu Lin again. This time, his eyes were looking at him as if he was already a dead person.Yu Lin: ?? What\u2019s the matter?Gu Qiuze didn\u2019t care but he turned to look at Chu Yin and asked softly, \u201cDo you want to dance?\u201dChu Yin gave a shallow smile and simply refused: \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dGu Qiuze understood and shook his hands towards Yu Lin.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go on with the dance and have fun~\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes as the auditorium resumed its liveliness.The little nerd just laughed.When she smiled, there was a small vortex on her cheeks, which made her look very sweet.But Lu Zhen\u2019s heart was suddenly sour.The reason was that she didn\u2019t laugh because of him. She never laughed in front of him like that.\u2026\u2026Chu Yin had experienced too much this night and was very tired. After saying goodbye to her brother, she left.Walking out of the entrance of the auditorium, in the shadow in the corner outside, a cold voice suddenly came. \u201cChu Yin.\u201dChu Yin was shocked and looked into the shadow.Lu Zhen took a step forward, his cold white face was half exposed, and the precise dark line was separated by the shade. Only the tear mole at the corner of his eye was visible.\u201cStudy hard.\u201d He said.Stop participating in these things and don\u2019t entertain the approach of others.Otherwise, he\u2026After Lu Zhen said such an inexplicable remark, he left. It seemed that he had been\u00a0 waiting for a long time outside the auditorium just to say this.Chapter 19 \u2013 Suddenly, he was slammed (2)Chu Yin looked at his back and said to the system, \u201cChicken, this dog man told me to study hard.\u201d\u201cYes, host.\u201dChu Yin touched the tip of her nose: \u201cBut if I study hard, he will have bad luck.\u201dXueji: \u201c\u2026\u201dJudging from the host\u2019s actions until now, it was indeed true!When the event finally ended, the melon-seeds eating people discussed for several days Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s snake dance and Zheng Yu\u2019s public pursuit of Chu Yin. After this, they finally focused on learning.Chu Yin and Jiang Yan were familiar with each other. They study very hard. They come early and leave late in class. During the break, they would either discuss topics or find teachers to ask questions. Because of this, it affected the class and motivated the rest of the students to study hard.As time passed by, people began to greet Chu Yin. But she didn\u2019t want to make any friends, nor intend to waste her time learning on meaningless social interactions.After the midterm exam results, Chu Yin became the treasure of all the teachers. Teacher Wang, who criticized her mathematics before, apologized to her, saying that she was too rushed and judgmental. She also told Chu Yin she was welcome to come and ask her any questions in the future.Of all the teachers, the English teacher had the best impression of Chu Yin. She had no prejudice against the child from the beginning. After the surprise of her midterm exam, the English teacher liked her even more.After class, the English teacher came over and told Chu Yin to go to the teacher\u2019s office with her.As soon as they left, Class 5 immediately started chatting.\u201cDo you think the teacher wants Chu Yin to participate in a competition?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible. After all, she has the highest English score in our class\u2026\u201dFu Mingxuan was not happy to hear this. Before Chu Yin transferred to this school, she always had the best score in English. Whenever there was an English competition, she was the first candidate the teacher would think of.Soon someone helped Fu Mingxuan express her doubts:\u201cBut this time it\u2019s a speech contest? Chu Yin\u2019s test score is really high, but for speech\u2026not sure.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Students who come from the province can\u2019t keep up with spoken English even if they can score in written English.\u201dJiang Yan, who was doing the questions quietly in the classroom, didn\u2019t want to talk at all.No matter how bad you think her English speech is, I bet hers will be better than any of yours.In the office, the English teacher called Chu Yin away to talk about it.\u201cSpeech Contest?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d the teacher nodded. \u201cI\u2019m just asking what you think about it. There\u2019s no pressure. This is just a competition in the city. If you like, you can use it as an opportunity to practice.\u201dUnlike International classes, which often had foreign teachers, English classes in ordinary classes were taught by Chinese teachers. And Chu Yin didn\u2019t answer questions often in English class, so the English teacher was not sure about her spoken English.But every time Chu Yin handed in her English composition, it would always be good. She was using words and sentences that were hard vocabulary wise, making her better than those in the class. Her English ability was good enough. Therefore, the English teacher planned to let Chu Yin participate in this contest. If her spoken English was ordinary, she could accumulate experience. If she was good at speaking, she could earn certificates that would pave way for her future studies.Chu Yin was quite interested, because\u2014\u2014\u201cDing! Releasing the system task ~ Win first place in the English speech contest. Four stars in difficulty. After completing, you can get permission to change a single sentence and a random special item card~\u201dHaving permission to change a single sentence was too sweet she couldn\u2019t bear to give it up.\u201cTeacher, I\u2019ll take part.\u201d Chu Yin said with a smile.The English teacher was very happy that she pulled her to talk about the competition experience for a long time before finally telling her not to be pressured and she could come to her whenever there was a problem.By the time she got out of the English office, the class break was over. Chu Yin didn\u2019t have time to go to the bathroom. And since she didn\u2019t want to be late, she hurried back to the classroom.Just after she entered the class, several people\u2019s eyes glanced over.Chu Yin didn\u2019t care as she went straight back to her seat.As soon as she sat down, Song Zhaolin, who sat beside her, covered his mouth and whispered, \u201cZheng Yu was here.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cZheng Yu?\u201dSong Zhaolin thought that his Sister Yin was really cold and didn\u2019t even remember the boy\u2019s name, \u201cThe annoying man who came to talk to you at the dance party that day!\u201dChu Yin recalled that face and felt a chill.Annoying, that\u2019s right.Although Song Zhaolin was annoying sometimes, his annoying appearance was quite lovely. Whereas, Zheng Yu\u2019s way of annoying revealed his disrespect for women in nature. It made her feel disgusted by him.\u201cWhat was he doing here?\u201dSong Zhaolin raised his chin, \u201cTo chase you.\u201dNo wonder several people in class strangely looked at her when she entered.Chu Yin stretched her hand under her table and pulled something. She found a small bunch of freshly-cut roses, a box of chocolates from a brand overseas, and some extra things.Song Zhaolin had secretly been observing the reaction of Chu Yin.Although the title of the school\u2019s flower was given to him accidentally, the whole school knew that Chu Yin was originally the school\u2019s flower. How dazzling the school\u2019s flower was! Everyone wanted to pursue her. Zheng Yu was the first one to dare to start.But Chu Yin didn\u2019t respond for a long time. Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat do you think about it, Sister Yin?\u201dChu Yin coldly threw the things aside: \u201cIs he mentally ill? There\u2019s water on the flowers, and my books are all wet.\u201dSong Zhaolin: How heartless!!!Love!!She is worthy to be his Sister Yin!!After class, Chu Yin directly asked Song Zhaolin to send those things back to the third year International class.Song Zhaolin ran and went to the second year of the International class. He told Lu Zhen and Tan ke the joke about Chu Yin rejecting Zheng Yu\u2019s gifts.He thought that Lu Zhen would not be interested in it. However, there was a smile on his lips, which showed he was in a good mood.\u201cDid she really say that?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cYes.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips rose for a moment.But thinking of people falling in love with her, his eyes drooped down.\u2026\u2026Everyone in the third year\u2019s International class knew that Zheng Yu was chasing Chu Shi\u2019s sister. Some people had asked Chu Shi what it meant.\u201cI don\u2019t interfere with her choice. She has the right to decide for herself or not.\u201dThe bottom line was that Xiao Yin shouldn\u2019t get hurt, otherwise he would interfere. After all, in his dream, Chu Yin lost her freedom and was under the control of others. She was very miserable. Chu Shi hoped that she could escape that kind of life as much as possible.Gu Qiuze only laughed and said nothing. If Zheng Yu could win Chu Yin\u2019s heart, he himself would be disappointed.As a result, Zheng Yu\u2019s offensive chasing became more and more vigorous.He placed candles in an open area of the school building, colorful balloons inside a car, and endless tricks.There had been countless posts on Huiwen\u2019s forum to talk about this matter.[Li Tao: How long can our quasi-school\u2019s flower last under such flamboyant courting?]1L: I bet it will take a week.2L: Actually, I think it will be soon. Zheng Yu is handsome and rich. It\u2019s hard for ordinary girls to resist.3L: @ 2L, I agree with you. If she had no plans to accept him, she should have rejected him long ago.4L: Tsk. Now I\u2019m regretting it. If I knew she was easy to chase, I should\u2019ve\u202610L: @4L, line up, and stand behind me.11L: When she breaks up with ZY, you can go after her.\u2026\u2026Chu Yin had been preparing for the upcoming English competition these days. She didn\u2019t know what the students were talking about in school.But after being blocked twice, she finally had the desire to kill.What\u2019s wrong with this man?? Who gave him the confidence to pursue her??This Zheng Yu was quite powerful. Her hatred value in her heart about him stood shoulder to shoulder with Lu Zhen.Song Zhaolin ate melon seeds on the spot every day. His biggest pleasure was to gossip about it live with his friends.\u201cSister Yin tore Zheng Yu\u2019s love letter!\u201d\u201cJust now she threw Zheng Yu\u2019s gift box in the garbage can. So beautiful!\u201dIt was interesting to hear Zheng Yu being beaten in the face. Tan Ke happily took a mouthful of melon seeds and couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cShe is really hard to chase\u2026\u201dLu Zhen, who was looking down to play with his mobile phone, suddenly raised his eyes.Song Zhaolin said, \u201cIt seems that Zheng Yu is going to use his last trick today. He wants to confess to her.\u201d\u201cOoh, damn.\u201dLu Zhen suddenly got up and went out frowning.\u201cWhere is Brother Zhen going?\u2014\u201dLu Zhen walked a few steps away with long legs.After going to the bathroom, Chu Yin washed her hands and dried it before coming out. Then, she saw the flamboyant man leaning against the opposite wall.Zheng Yu carefully selected the angle, with a 45-degree side to face her, while making a deep and melancholy expression.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know why but she suddenly thought of another picture.Lu Zhen also waited for her many times.Leaning against the wall, with his head tilted upwards, either looking casual or looking as if thinking he was in deep thoughts.God is very kind to Lu Zhen. Even if he had no expression and just stood there quietly, he would still look extremely handsome, straight out from a magazine.\u2013and so,Chu Yin sighed.This old lady could handle any guys that could rival the same level as Lu Zhen. But this man with the surname Zheng, what confidence did he have for her to accept him?\u201cYin Yin, I have something to tell you.\u201d Zheng Yu looked at her affectionately.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to listen.She tapped on the system: \u201cUnlock the script.\u201d\u3010Zheng Yu has been ridiculed by his friends for several days already. If he can\u2019t win Chu Yin\u2019s heart, he would have no face to see them. Today, he prepared this killer move to obtain Chu Yin. ]Zheng Yu went to Chu Yin and said, \u201cMaybe you think I\u2019m not sincere enough, so I\u2019m here to show you my sincerity today.\u201dHe turned and took a small box out of his pocket.At the same time, Lu Zhen came from the side of the corridor. ]Chu Yin raised her eyebrow: Lu Zhen is coming??\u3010Then, Zheng Yu turned around, slammed Chu Yin on the wall, closed his eyes, and pointed to his heart: \u201cI like you, I really do\u2026\u201d\u3011Chu Yin had goosebumps: What\u2019s wrong with this script?!She was thinking about how to change it when she saw a glimpse of Lu Zhen\u2019s figure.The young man walked fast, with a gloomy breath on his body.Chu Yin suddenly had an idea \u2014 since it was delivered to her door, it shouldn\u2019t be wasted!!Let the dog man handle it!!!She moved her light pen and fell on the sentence [ Slammed Chu Yin on the wall ] . She scratched her name and wrote [ Lu Zhen ] . Then, Zheng Yu turned around and slipped to one side.Xueji looked at the depressed male lead who knew nothing at this moment, \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen frowned while showing a calm expression.He had just arrived at where Chu Yin was.But before he could say a word, he was caught off guard and was slammed on the wall.\u2014\u2014Shit?Zheng Yu closed his eyes, cupped his heart, and pursed his lips slightly: \u201cI like you, I really do\u2026\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWow.\u201dAlthough Lu Zhen\u2019s face was expressionless, the veins from the back of his hands bulged.Three seconds later\u2014\u2014\u201cBang!\u201d With a loud noise, Zheng Yu was kicked.Lu Zhen: \u201cGo die.\u201dThe author has something to say:Chu Yin looked frightened: I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re in such a relationship!Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am Not Fit to Be the Male Lead\u2019s First LoveCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20 \u2013 Kneeling (1)At that moment Zheng Yu flew out, and frankly speaking, Chu Yin felt refreshed.As the successor of one of the top companies, Lu Zhen received not only elite education but also fighting skills. His training was not comparable to ordinary people.His posture, angle, and strength were all perfect.His long leg full of explosive power\u2026Zheng Yu was kicked with this perfect fighting stance.\u2026Cool!!Chu Yin restrained her elated expression and tried to adjust the face of surprise, panic, and horror.Zheng Yu fell to the ground with a loud bang. Several students who happened to pass by were shocked. They wanted to eat melon seeds but didn\u2019t dare to eat them in front of Lu Zhen. They hid their gossiping eyes as they tried to watch secretly.What happened?Zheng Yu got beaten by Lu Zhen??Wasn\u2019t Zheng Yu chasing Chu Yin??Huh???Zheng Yu fell to the ground and couldn\u2019t get up. His annoying and flamboyant expression disappeared, leaving only a look of pain.Lu Zhen had a dark and grim face as he tilted his neck. He was full of hostility, \u201cReally, your mother.\u201dChu Yin was about to burst into laughter but held herself back by pressing the corner of her lips.It was a pity that she couldn\u2019t watch it in a first-class seat. The thought of Lu Zhen being confessed to by this flamboyant man made her feel contented.It would definitely be one rare adventure in Lu Zhen\u2019s life.Some of Zheng Yu\u2019s friends watched the scene in the dark. Who knew that Zheng Yu was blind enough to slam against Lu Zhen? They immediately felt cold. Sure enough, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t spare him at all and kicked him ruthlessly. It was painful to watch.Seeing that Zheng Yu couldn\u2019t get up even after waiting for a few seconds, his friends rushed to help him. They apologized to Lu Zhen before hurriedly walking away.Lu Zhen\u2019s icy gaze glanced around. And those few melon seeds eating people who were loitering around ran away immediately.Chu Yin tugged the sleeve of her school uniform before slipping quietly along the wall. After a few steps, she felt a scorching gaze towards her.\u201cSorry,\u201d Lu Zhen looked at her, \u201cDid I disturb you two?\u201dChu Yin: This dog man is weird!!She stopped and said seriously, \u201cNo. Thank you.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips twitched slightly, \u201cHe was beaten by me. You don\u2019t want to ask me about it?\u201dChu Yin couldn\u2019t help looking at him.Although she didn\u2019t want to say anything to Lu Zhen, Chu Yin still replied, \u201cHe disturbed my study, which was very annoying.\u201dLu Zhen suddenly laughed.Learning was more important than anything else. She was really cold.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart was a little sour but somehow also pacified by her reply.\u201cSo you like it when they\u2019re the same as you,\u201d Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cthat studies well?\u201dChu Yin looked at him strangely, with a sense of scrutiny.Lu Zhen seemed to have more interest in her as a nerd, who was only devoted to studying, but it was different from her previous life. Chu Yin didn\u2019t see the familiar aggressiveness in his eyes.But was Lu Zhen such a person?Chu Yin was on full alert as she looked at him suspiciously.Lu Zhen straightened his back subconsciously. The hand hanging on his side tightened slightly while his fingertips unconsciously rubbed his knuckles.Today should be a good chance to change clothes\u00a01.\u00a0Lu Zhen thought.Chu Yin finally shook her head: \u201cI don\u2019t like anyone. I just want to study hard.\u201dThis was her personality of constantly alienating him.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart, which was just beginning to burn, slowly cooled down, making him feel pain.After a while, he gave a light smile: \u201cGo to class, good student.\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin walked to a place with no people, then called out the system to show the script.Lu Zhen, as a top-class cold male lead, had a chance to become abnormal in his later stage. He had always been the type of person who was hard to guess. Even in the script, his psychological state and thoughts were not often described. There would occasionally be only one or two sentences.Chu Yin also discussed this matter with Xueji. She found that under the system rules, she could not directly tamper with the emotional and psychological elements of the characters. For example, she couldn\u2019t tamper with her fake sister\u2019s mind to abandon evil and promote the good. So, she could only make Lu Zhen ignore her or hate her.Therefore, she could only deduce their psychology through their behavior by monitoring them in real-time. Prevention was better than cure.She had no choice but to use the script and modify the situation slightly.Alas, a script artist is more difficult than a novel writer.\u2026\u2026Although the students kept silent, the incident about the matter still spread.After all, there were many witnesses, plus Lu Zhen was involved. At the same time, this incident centered on a few hot figures recently. The students\u2019 gossiping nature was intrigued by the news.Someone in the anonymous forum created a thread: [ Do you know that the third-year senior ZY was beaten? He was confessing just outside the floor of second year\u2019s girls\u2019 toilet before he suddenly got beaten! ]Anonymous 1: Passing the microphone\u00a02Anonymous 2: The internet is very good. Please continue talking.Anonymous 4: I can see that the person who created this thread has no desire to survive. Hahahaa. If it\u2019s me, I dare not mention it.\u2026\u2026Anonymous 10: I happened to be at the scene. My jaw literally dropped.Anonymous 11: @ 10, catch!! Master, please look here!!!\u00a03Anonymous 12: Because of jealousy? Wasn\u2019t Zheng Yu chasing Chu Yin? He was about to confess but then got beaten by Z. It\u2019s not hard to deduce this.Anonymous 13: Are you mentally retarded\u00a04? Jealousy???Anonymous 14: That\u2019s funny. Do you guys think Chu Yin is pretty?\u2026\u2026The next thing that happened was the battle of curses from netizens.Anonymous 85: Stop it!! I\u2019ll tell you the truth! It was Zheng Yu who suddenly slammed Lu Zhen on the wall before he got kicked! I saw it with my own eyes!!Anonymous 86\uff1a??Anonymous 87\uff1a????Things suddenly reversed, making everyone surprised.What, what\u2019s going on?? All of a sudden it turned out to be a boy\u2019s love??The problem \u2014 the center of the subject was Lu Zhen! They dared not think about it!Song Zhaolin, who wasn\u2019t listening in class, was browsing the forum. When he saw this reply, the water in his mouth gushed out: \u201cPoo\u2013\u201dThe Mathematics teacher immediately glared over: \u201cSong Zhaolin, what are you doing?\u201dSong Zhaolin apologized while wiping the water: \u201cSorry, teacher. I choked!\u201dWas this Zheng Yu confused with his identity?? Why did he chase after Sister Yin in front of so many people and yet went after Brother Zhen in the end??Meanwhile, in the same classroom, the good student Fu Mingxuan was also not listening to the lecture.She was in deep thought. Although Lu Zhen threw her into the water before, which broke her heart, she couldn\u2019t accept that Lu Zhen was interested in other girls, especially Chu Yin, the country bumpkin everyone looked down upon at the beginning.So seeing that Lu Zhen didn\u2019t beat Zheng Yu just because of Chu Yin, Fu Mingxuan immediately breathed a sigh of relief.Song Zhaolin poked Chu Yin, who was quietly studying next to him, \u201cSister Yin, Sister Yin. Zheng Yu really slammed by brother?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face was serious, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2013Fuck!\u201d Song Zhaolin covered his mouth and lowered his voice, \u201cWhy?! Didn\u2019t he confess to you!\u201dChu Yin thought for a while, \u201cMaybe he felt that Lu Zhen was too handsome so he suddenly couldn\u2019t control himself. He thought that maybe it was the only chance he got\u2026this is love.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe last time she made a similar statement, it was when she talked about him and Lu Zhen.Every time Sister Yin misunderstood, she would explain it in great detail that sounded nonsensical but still, held great meaning.Song Zhaolin: Knowledge of strange things increased.jpgHowever, as the school was noisy, Chu Yin still didn\u2019t care about these rumors.Speaking of which, Lu Zhen\u2019s kick helped her situation. This time, she didn\u2019t see Zheng Yu\u2019s annoying face and could focus on her studies.After Chu Yin wrote her speech, she would still have to practice it.The speech draft also needed to be polished over and over again to be suitable for the rhythm. Also, she must prepare herself for the impromptu speech part and study a lot of source materials.Chu Yin had studied abroad. Although she knew that her English skills were adequate, she had no experience in speech competitions. The English teacher found a lot of videos of English speech competitions for her and asked her to practice.Jiang Yan came to see her after class. Song Zhaolin was not in his seat so she sat down in his seat.Seeing Chu Yin seriously practicing, Jiang Yan was a little worried: \u201cYin Yin, I heard that Liang Yueqi of the international class is going to participate. She was the champion last year.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyebrow raised: Liang Yueqi?This was an acquaintance.The Liang family was also one of the top wealthiest families. They were friends with the Lu family. In her previous life, the Lu family intended to marry the Liang family, but because Lu Zhen later took power, the matter was directly destroyed.Liang Yueqi loved Lu Zhen and considered herself as Lu Zhen\u2019s future wife. She was more clever than a small cannon fodder like Fu Mingxuan. She didn\u2019t publicize or behave with great fanfare. She didn\u2019t have a high reputation like Chu Qiuqiu. She preferred to reflect on her differences with others.For example, she could be invited to the Lu family as a guest. Or she could take the Lu family\u2019s car to pick up Lu Zhen, and so on.In this life, Chu Yin hoped she would keep Lu Zhen locked so that he would not harm her.Chapter 20 \u2013 Kneeling (2)Jiang Yan looked at Chu Yin\u2019s smile and said, \u201cYin Yin, you\u2019re not worried?\u201dChu Yin laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s useless to worry. I\u2019ll just do my best.\u201dIt\u2019s not enough to fear Liang Yueqi.Jiang Yan sighed.\u00a0Chu Yin is really worthy.Even if Jiang Yan was a girl, she could still feel the \u2018valiant\u2019 aura in Chu Yin every time. She seemed to be much more mature than them. Chu Yin wasn\u2019t affected by the eyes and comments of other people. She was firm and focused on her own goals.Jiang Yan could understand why so many people like Chu Yin. She had a strong charm.\u201cI\u2019ll cheer you on during the competition!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSong Zhaolin went to the international class.He was itchy, wanting to know how Lu Zhen felt when he was slammed to the wall or whether he was jealous. But he didn\u2019t dare ask this and only scratched his head.Tan Ke looked uncomfortable. \u201cLin Zi, you didn\u2019t take a bath?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cDamn you\u2019re the one who didn\u2019t take a bath!\u201dHis deskmate was a beauty so he must ensure that he was fragrant every day to avoid his deskmate\u2019s dislike.Song Zhaolin fortunately didn\u2019t ask any questions since someone asked the question in his stead.Lian Yueqi came over and stood in front of Lu Zhen\u2019s desk, \u201cLu Zhen, the rumors aren\u2019t true, right?\u201dLiang Yueqi daring to ask Lu Zhen this question face to face was proof that the friendship between the Lu family and Liang family was good.The entire students in International class instantly raised their ears including Chu Qiuqiu. They couldn\u2019t help but listen.Lu Zhen slightly raised his head and glanced at her: \u201cWhat?\u201dLiang Yueqi smiled, her tone relaxed, \u201cThen does this mean that you\u2019re jealous and you fought for love?\u201dLu Zhen paused before a cold smile appeared a second later.This was his attitude.Liang Yueqi got her answer and the people who were secretly eating melon seeds were also satisfied. After Liang Yueqi casually raised the topic, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t respond.He lowered his eyes, the game on his phone showed game over. He was killed by the enemies and died.He fought because he was jealous?\u201c\u2026Can you lend us the foreign teacher for two days that Grandfather Lu invited?\u201d Liang Yueqi\u2019s tone towards him was very familiar, \u201cI have to practice since the speech contest is near.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cWhatever.\u201dTan Ke enthusiastically asked, \u201cAre you going to win this year again?\u201dLiang Yueqi smiled brightly, her eyes glanced at Lu Zhen, \u201cIsn\u2019t it thanks to Brother Zhen that didn\u2019t participate? If he does, I will only be a runner-up~\u201dThis was true. People who were familiar with Lu Zhen knew that he stayed in the United States when he was a child. His english was as fluent as his mother tongue.The teacher of the international class also asked Lu Zhen but obviously he declined.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t need those awards.His future path was already paved. After finishing high school, he would go abroad to study. Once he comes back, he would take over the company. Then he would marry a woman with an equal amount of power. Their marriage would merge and expand Lu\u2019s empire.Every step was carefully planned. There would be no mistakes.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t speak. He placed his mobile phone into his trouser pocket and got up to leave the classroom.He habitually went to the rooftop first but found no one. Lu Zhen went down the stairs, walked aimlessly in the building, and finally stopped by the window at the corner of the third floor.With the design of the building, he could see the person studying behind the window, opposite the corner.Chu Yin held the manuscript, muttering words, and constantly adjusting her expression.Through the two layers of glass, Lu Zhen could see the cover of the manuscript. It said: \u201cXX Cup speech contest draft\u201dWhen the class bell rang, Chu Yin turned around and ran back to the classroom. Lu Zhen turned around and walked into the English teacher\u2019s office.\u2014\u201dYou want to participate in the competition?\u201d The teacher was a little surprised.Although she hoped Lu Zhen would participate in more competitions every year,\u00a0 because of Lu Zhen\u2019s special status, he was not interested and couldn\u2019t be persuaded.At this moment, the young man in front of her was handsome as he looked at her with cold eyes. He didn\u2019t seem to be joking.\u201cYes. I will participate.\u201dHe probably wanted to prove it.He was not ignorant. He could also be a good student.Zheng Yu returned to school three days later.The Zheng family\u2019s precious son was beaten. They were originally furious but when they knew who did it, they didn\u2019t dare to speak.Not only did they dare not to come and ask for an explanation, but they had to bring gifts to explain the situation.Zheng Yu was wronged from beginning to end.He didn\u2019t know how he had dared approach Lu Zhen! He was not interested in Lu Zhen!His confession and ring that he prepared were all useless. He laid in the hospital for two days in vain!When he returned to school, his classmates looked at him as if he was a joke.Zheng Yu\u2019s self-esteem was hurt. He slapped the table and shouted, \u201cI won\u2019t give up!!\u201dHe never felt he couldn\u2019t win Chu Yin. He also knew that Chu Yin had a good impression of him!Chu Shi frowned and was left speechless by Zheng Yu\u2019s actions.Gu Qiuze next to him also sighed: \u201cHe really loves your sister.\u201dBut those melon-seeds eating people were just happy to see if his confession would be successful or not.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You\u2019re not over it yet?\u201d\u201cAre you sure you can do it? You can\u2019t even win a country-bumpkin\u2019s heart?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t do it, can\u2019t you just move on?\u201dZheng Yu: \u201cGive me another chance. I will definitely get it done.\u201dOn that day, someone posted in the online forum to attract those melon-seeds people.[ The party concerned said that he still wanted to pursue his love! ]Anonymous 1: I\u2019m moved by his dedication.Anonymous 2: To be honest, it was because Zheng Yu tried to manipulate the situation last time. Otherwise, why would it be unsuccessful? It\u2019s not difficult to get her.Anonymous 3: I can pursue Chu Yin for you.Anonymous 4: Yes. Maybe she just enjoys being chased. She will say yes to you if you chase her enough.\u2026\u2026Anonymous 20: According to the latest news, Zheng Yu planned to bribe her family with money.Anonymous 21: 666\u00a01, I\u2019ll see it tomorrow!Chu Yin herself was the last to know about the comeback Zheng Yu was planning.Song Zhaolin knew that Chu Yin was busy studying and had no time to browse the online forum.\u00a0 So, like a little eunuch delivering memorials, Song Zhaolin personally gathered all the news and information and presented it to Chu Yin.Chu Yin was very upset.It just so happened that today, the task given by the system was very difficult. Chu Yin was already irritated, but this news just hit the gut.Chu Yin squeezed the pen, threw aside the paper with a calm face, and relayed the paper to check the calculation.Song Zhaolin looked dumbfounded by her actions.Oh, my God, his Sister Yin is so beautiful when she looks fierce..!!!It took Chu Yin another ten minutes to complete the problems.The class ended before noon.\u201cDing \u2013 Complete today\u2019s final math problem \u221a unlocked the script, and get the permission to change a word~\u201dChu Yin opened the script and quickly learned that this overconfident man would launch his final offensive attack this lunch break.\u3010Location: At the door of Class 5. Characters: Chu Yin, Zheng Yu, students.\u3011\u3010Zheng Yu held the flowers in his hand. He looked at Chu Yin as he walked towards her step by step.This time, Zheng Yu didn\u2019t dare to close his eyes, and finally the wall was successful! His Adam\u2019s apple rolled as he looked at the girl in front of him. Then, he confessed affectionately in front of everyone.\u3011Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dComeback?Comeback???Chu Yin took a deep breath. She smiled as she changed [wall] to [ground].Since you like the ground so much, you go and kiss the ground!Outside the classroom, Zheng Yu waited with flowers on hand. Many students were excited to watch the scene.A new post in the forum- [ Live broadcast! A true love confession on site! A campus couple is about to be born! ]As soon as Chu Yin appeared, Zheng Yu walked towards her slowly which made the audience\u2019s appetite satisfied.Then, he moved!They saw him step forward\u2014\u2014And pounced on the ground!The air suddenly quieted down.Zheng Yu looked at the ground that was only ten centimeters away from his face and to Chu Yin\u2019s shoes not far away.It took him a long time to understand in the awkward silence of everyone\u2013in full view, he became a kneeling boy.Chu Yin took a step back, her expression was noble and cold.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t accept you. You can stand.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)A few minutes later, the previous thread sank to the bottom and was replaced with a new thread that was posted in the forum\u2014\u2014[ The queen is coming!! Get out of the way!!! \u2014 ]A photo was posted in the forum. It was exactly the picture of Zheng Yu throwing himself to the grown and Chu Yin looking down coldly.The girl in the photo was indifferent. From her full forehead, nose tip, and to her lips, every curvature was beautiful! Under this aura, she looked like an ice sculpture that was carefully carved.This time, not only the boys but also many girls fell in love.She was still in her old school uniform of Huiwen which was loose and baggy. Although she wasn\u2019t wearing any dazzling items on her body, she was still inexplicably beautiful.There were a lot of replies in the thread.Anonymous 1: She\u2019s really beautiful, to be honest.Anonymous 2: After seeing this picture, I suddenly understand why Zheng Yu failed.Anonymous 3: Sister, I can\u2026!!!Anonymous 4: Zheng Yu is also awesome. He is actually kneeling directly?!Anonymous 5: What\u2019s more, there was no fluctuation in her voice when she said \u2018no, stand up.\u201d It\u2019s a slap in his face.Anonymous 10: Sister, I can\u2026!!!!Song Zhaolin, the owner of this post, looked at the reply in his thread with satisfaction. He removed the shady comments and only left comments that were praising Chu Yin.As the first person to see Chu Yin\u2019s true beauty, he felt inexplicably proud when he saw more people recognized Sister Yin\u2019s prosperous beauty.The event ended with Zheng Yu\u2019s friends rushing to carry him away again.Zheng Yu\u2019s expression was horrible as it collapsed. He started to be suspicious of life and was in a daze for a long time. Because of this, he gained a psychological shadow of chasing girls.Chu Yin was relieved. She could finally study hard \u221a\u2026The competition would be a week from now. Chu Yin had a rare sense of urgency as she prepared for the competition simultaneously doing her daily studies.Chu Shi knew that she was going to compete and planned to call Gu Qiuze on the weekend to help her practice. After all, he had won all kinds of awards, accumulating experiences in various competitions.On Sunday morning, while the Chu family was still asleep, the servants were already preparing breakfast in the kitchen.Chu Yin went down to the living room and stood in front of the window to practice.The servant brought a cup of warm water and flattered her: \u201cMiss, you are really diligent.\u201dThe two young ladies looked very similar in the Chu family. As they were the same age, the family didn\u2019t say they were twins. Though the servants had no right to talk about their internal affairs, they must have a lot of speculations.Seeing the young lady from the countryside taking the first rank, the Chu family\u2019s parents were very satisfied. It seemed that the eldest young master also favored Chu Yin. The servants naturally followed the wind and did not dare to neglect Chu Yin at all.Chu Yin also knew what these people thought. She took the cup and said thanks.The impromptu speech in this competition was relatively difficult. The English teacher prepared a lot of topics and subjects for her. The safest method was to memorize all of them, but Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help but feel a headache from looking at the thick A4 papers.\u201cDing\u2013today\u2019s learning task\u2013memorize three speech materials in 30 minutes. After completion, you get permission to change a word~\u201dChu Yin: \u2026\u201cWow\u2026so now you added a time limit?\u201dXueji\u2019s voice sounded: \u201cThe difficulty of the task increases with the improvement of the host\u2019s ability. When you feel the difficulty of the task increases, congratulations. The system judges that your learning ability and intelligence level have also improved! Now the countdown is 29:59-\u201cChu Yin: \u201cOkay, okay. I see\u2026\u201dShe had always been afraid of tasks with memorizing. She was not a person with a good memory. It was her nightmare when she was forced to recite in her previous life.With time constraints, her focus and attention were highly concentrated. When she finally finished memorizing the three articles in the allotted time, the system notified her of her reward.Chu Yin opened the script at will.\u3010\u2026Chu Yin had been reciting materials and practicing facial expressions for her speech contest. Although she had a bad memory, she worked very hard, making her speech level improve.\u3011Sure enough, the script was simply about her. It was meaningless.Chu Yin was about to close the script when she suddenly had a flash in her head\u2014\u2014Could she change her own script? Like modifying the description within the plot?Xueji looked at her, lost in thought.It felt like the host had opened a door to a new world.Chu Yin moved the light pen, crossed out the word [bad], and changed it into [good]It was shameless but who let her have golden fingers?After the change, she waited for three seconds, but she didn\u2019t feel anything.Chu Yin knocked at the knock system with a little uncertainty: \u201cIt didn\u2019t work?\u201dXueji: \u201cPlease feel it by yourself.\u201dChu Yin lowered her eyes and went to a new article.After reading the whole article, she raised her head and closed her eyes.\u2014She could remember 80% of the article!!Chu Yan was instantly excited\u2014It\u2019s done! She changed her memory buff!!!What\u2019s this? She could play by herself!If she knew, she would have changed the word into \u2018amazing memory\u2019. From now on, the burden of studying was reduced by half. This was simply the strongest gospel for liberal arts students!!Chu Yan was so happy that she drank a bottle of brain platinum\u00a01.After unlocking a new world, she had a big idea. By just having this script in her hand, she could dominate life as she pleases? In the future, she could buy a lottery to win the jackpot or buy a limited number of stocks. It was simply too awesome.Xueji: The host is gradually becoming abnormal.jpg\u2026Chu Qiuqiu went downstairs and saw Chu Yin standing in the living room with a dazzling smile.She had been to a psychologist recently, wondering if she had a mental problem that couldn\u2019t be controlled by her consciousness.She lost such a big face when she danced last time, and she couldn\u2019t show her face for a long time. Then, there was so much news that Chu Yin was pursued by a male student in school. Why?And for this speech contest, she deliberately didn\u2019t register because she would be competing with Liang Yueqi. How did Chu Yin have the courage to participate?Chu Qiuqiu looked at the thick pile of manuscripts in her hand and couldn\u2019t help saying: \u201cSister, you can\u2019t compare to Liang Yueqi, so give up.\u201dChu Yin looked back at her.She was in a good mood now and didn\u2019t want to deal with Chu Qiuqiu.Chu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t know when her country bumpkin sister had the upper hand. She repeatedly failed to show Chu Yin who was better.She felt like she was punching cotton so she continued, pretending that she cared: \u201cYou have a bad foundation and your spoken language is definitely not better than others. I\u2019ll secretly tell you, Liang Yueqi borrowed foreign teachers from Lu Zhen. She was originally good, but with external assistance, you can\u2019t win her.\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows slightly. She also knew Lu Zhen\u2019s foreign teacher. He was a nice old American man who had been hired by the Lu family for many years. Although the old man in the previous life could not do anything about her situation, he would try to make her happy every time he came to teach her.Chu Qiuqiu observed her expression and finally felt comfortable: \u201cSister, I\u2019m looking ouy for you. After all, you have no experience in competitions, I\u2019m afraid you\u2019d hold too much hope and would end up disappointed.\u201dAs her voice fell, the Chu family\u2019s door was opened. Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze walked in.Chu Qiuqiu was surprised. Her good mood was then broken by a single sentence from her brother.Chu Shi hooked Gu Qiuze\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLittle Yin, I have brought you your foreign aid.\u201dGu Qiuze smiled warmly and waved to the two sisters in the living room.Chu Qiuqiu was slapped in the face as soon as she finished speaking. She immediately felt embarrassed. She ran back to the room, feeling wronged, but no one at the scene cared about her mood.After having breakfast together, Gu Qiuze sat in the living room to help Chu Yin review the draft, and then made her practice on the spot.Chu Yin rarely felt nervous. When she stood up, she clasped her hands in her lower abdomen, and the little rabbit cotton slippers on her feet subconsciously made a T-step.The girl was still wearing pajamas. She looked very soft. Gu Qiuze smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous. Just try to see me and your big brother as big turnips.\u201dChu Yin nodded, cleared her voice, and then recited the manuscript from the beginning to the end, as much as possible.After the speech, the two-person audience clapped at once.Gu Qiuze was really surprised. He was originally worried that Chu Yin would have bad pronunciation from having studied in a village school. Although he didn\u2019t expect she would have a proficient beautiful voice, the pronunciation was familiar.He didn\u2019t know why Chu Yin\u2019s pronunciation made him feel familiar as if he had heard it before.Chu Shi also did not expect sister to speak so well and crazily praised her: \u201cYou can win the championship with no problem!\u201dGu Qiuze also said: \u201cIt\u2019s really great, but to win the championship, you need to change a little.\u201dChu Yin asked with a guilty conscience, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dGu Qiuze looked at her and smiled: \u201cExpression.\u201dChu Shi pulled Chu Yin and Gu Qiuze onto a sofa and made them sit face to face. Chu Yin felt a little embarrassed, but to make progress, she didn\u2019t say anything in the end and only made a little distance from him silently.Chapter 21 \u2013 Win the Competition! (2)\u201cYour expression should be in line with the content of your manuscript. For example, when you mentioned in the mid-paragraph about meeting a strange person, your surprise and panic should be portrayed in your expression to arouse the audience\u2019s emotions.\u201dAfter Gu Qiuze finished, he saw Chu Yin\u2019s placid face, \u201cShow me how surprised you are.\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows, her eyes were dark and round, and her lips parted slightly as she looked at him.Gu Qiuze couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed directly.Chu Yin was a little embarrassed: \u201cIs my facial expression not enough?\u201dThe two brothers only laughed and didn\u2019t speak.But Chu Yin gradually found the feelings needed in her manuscript. After adding expressions, her speech sounded much clearer with the rhythm. Under the guidance of Gu Qiuze, Chu Yin revised some changes that made it even more professional. Chu Yin got a lot of inspiration and sincerely thanked Gu Qiuze.Gu Qiuze was also a good man in her previous life. He was completely the opposite of the cold and paranoid Lu Zhen.She didn\u2019t like Gu Qiuze that much in her last life. If she wasn\u2019t preoccupied with Lu Zhen, she might have learned to accept Gu Qiuze and fall in love with him. But in the end, she didn\u2019t experience a normal love life in her short life.Gu Qiuze stayed at Chu\u2019s residence all morning. He had something to do at noon and didn\u2019t stay for lunch.\u201cYin Yin, go and send off Brother Qiuze.\u201d Chu Shi said.Chu Yin looked at him and nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201dPushing the door open, the girl, who was still wearing pajamas, followed him out. Gu Qiuze turned back and looked at her with a smile. \u201cDon\u2019t be too nervous. I\u2019m sure if nothing happens, you\u2019ll get the championship.\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d Gu Qiuze looked down and touched her head, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so polite with me.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cOkay, I understand.\u201dThey lived in the wealthiest district of the city. Gu\u2019s family also lived nearby. As the villa goes deeper, the higher the price of the lot. After Gu Qiuze left, Chu Yin also turned and went back.In the distance of the tallest building, Lu Zhen leaned on the balcony of the second floor, staring at the man and woman. He withdrew his sight after coldly looking at them for a long time.He depressedly turned and went downstairs after hearing the butler\u2019s call.His grandfather was sitting in the living room drinking tea. They had a guest today.Lu Zhen\u2019s younger uncle Lu Linyuan had always been a slightly sensitive topic in the wealthy circle.Grandfather Lu had an affair a few years earlier and had a son from outside. After Grandfather Lu\u2019s legitimate son died, the son who was raised outside, was the only one left.Lu Linyuan was in charge of all the properties of the Lu family. He and Lu Zhen were like two sides of the Lu family\u2019s huge empire. Lu Zhen stood on the bright side, taking over the power in the future, while Lin Linyuan stood on the dark side as the Lu family\u2019s secret knife.Seeing Lu Zhen walking downstairs, Lu Linyuan smiled: \u201cAh Zhen is coming?\u201dLu Zhen, although in a bad mood, still nodded: \u201cUncle.\u201dLi Lunyuan was only ten years older than Lu Zhen. He was more like Lu Zhen\u2019s older brother. He had been very good to Lu Zhen since childhood.Beside Li Lunyuan was Liang Yueqi. She was dressed in formal clothes. To maintain a good impression in front of Grandfather Lu, she didn\u2019t dare sit down.As Grandfather Lu got older, his temperament became much better. He looked at Liang Yueqi cheerfully, \u201cHow is your grandfather?\u201dLiang Yueqi cleverly answered, \u201cMy grandfather said that he would like to play golf with you every day.\u201dOld man Lu laughed, \u201cOld bones is restless.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s sight turned between Liang Yueqi and Lu Zhen and said with a smile, \u201cYou two were born in the same year, and now you are classmates. This is fate.\u201dThe old man Lu liked to listen to this, and nodded with a smile: \u201cAh Zhen is nice to Qiqi in school. And also, when you were a child, you two shared a kiss.\u201dLiang Yueqi immediately blushed.Lu Zhen was just leaning on the sofa, his eyes slightly empty. No one knew what he was thinking.Grandfather Lu couldn\u2019t sit for a long time, so he was helped back to his room.Liang Yueqi looked expectantly at Lu Zhen: \u201cI will have a competition next week. Lu Zhen, do you want to go to see it?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s dark eyes were dark and heavy. He didn\u2019t speak for a long time. When Liang Yueqi thought he wouldn\u2019t answer, Lu Zhen\u2019s cold voice sounded, \u201cOk.\u201dAlthough Chu Yin preferred people like Gu Qiuze.He still wanted to try proving he wasn\u2019t cheap.Liang Yueqi didn\u2019t expect that he would agree, so she was very surprised.After a while, Lu Zhen sent both his uncle and Liang Yueqi out. Li Lunyuan looked back at the happy little girl and asked him in a low voice, \u201cDo you like her or not?\u201dLu Zhen said coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t like her.\u201dLu Linyuan raised his eyebrows imperceptibly and then asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s your preference? Uncle will help you find a girl.\u201dLu Zhen waved his hand: \u201cC\u2019mon.\u201dLu Linyuan smiled, his eyes held deep meaning, and didn\u2019t ask him again. He then left with Liang Yueqi.Finally, it was the day of the competition.Under the effect of the enhanced memory buff, Chu Yin mastered all the materials in her heart.She was not afraid of Liang Yueqi. Her goal was the championship, no one could stop her.The competition venue was located in the neighboring school. Students from various schools in the city came to participate.Chu Yin arrived early in the morning. When she got out of the car, a lot of eyes stared at her.Because she wore the school uniform, it was easy for others to distinguish.\u201cHuiwen?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so beautiful, my god!\u201d\u201cWhy haven\u2019t I heard of her name? Is she not the school\u2019s flower?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s complexion was calm. She quickly walked out of everyone\u2019s sight. After a while, a car also stopped at the gate of the school and a student of Huiwen came out.\u201cI know her. She\u2019s the last year\u2019s champion\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s also pretty. Her fashion style is better than the one who came before.\u201d\u201cBut her face is a little bland compared to the girl before\u2026\u201dLiang Yueqi took off her sunglasses and walked confidently to the school.Students who come to participate in the competition would get a handbook at the registration office after signing in and drawing lots. The number drawn by Chu Yin was No. 13, which was in the middle, not good nor bad.After entering the competition venue, the students from the school guided the contestants to sit in their seats and wait for the competition to start.Jiang Yan slipped in from the back door, ran to Chu Yin, and handed her a drink.\u201cNot nervous?\u201d Jiang Yan asked.Chu Yin laughed: \u201cI think you are more nervous than me.\u201dJiang Yan came to learn, but as soon as she entered the venue, she became very nervous. Fortunately, Chu Yin wasn\u2019t acting the same as her. She looked very stable now.After a while, Liang Yueqi came in from outside. Her eyes glanced at Chu Yin before going to her assigned seat No. 8.Jiang Yan was relieved and whispered, \u201cFortunately, her number is ahead of you.\u201dThere were more and more people in the contestant area. Jiang Yan couldn\u2019t stay any longer. After repeatedly encouraging Chu Yin, she returned to the audience area.There were already people sitting on both the front and right side of Chu Yin, while her left side was still empty. She heard that every year, there would be a contest that would withdraw. The person sitting next to her was probably not coming.She reviewed the manuscript silently in her heart. Suddenly, she heard someone calling her in a low voice.\u201cSister Yin!\u201dChu Yin looked along and saw Zhaolin\u2019s smiling face.He made a big love gesture by placing both his hands on his head, forming a heart shape. Then, he showed a few more cheering moves which made Chu Yin amused. Although her son was a good for nothing, he could cheer her up.After seeing Song Zhaolin, Liang Yueqi\u2019s eyes brightened obviously, and began to look for someone around the competition field.And when the competition almost started, she couldn\u2019t find the person she wanted to see. She turned back in disappointment.The host took the stage and the judges took their seats. After a simple opening remark and speeches, the competition officially began.The first round was a speech presentation and it would be in the order of the lots drawn.The first two players were probably too nervous since their voices in the microphone were shaking, which affected their performance. As soon as they stepped down, they covered their faces and left.Among the top 7 players, only No. 5 and No. 6 performed well, and the other players performed mediocrely. When Liang Yueqi came on stage on the 8th, there was applause in the audience.Nearly 10 minutes of speech, Liang Yueqi did very well. She was fluent and smooth in the first half with standard pronunciation and emotional involvement. It\u2019s just that when she arrived in the middle and late part of her speech, she saw a familiar person from the audience. However, even from this, her professional ability was excellent, and she quickly picked up her performance.Before she stepped down, Chu Yin\u2019s mobile phone got several messages.Jiang Yan: [Liang Yueqi is good. She has good pronunciation and good speech content]Jiang Yan:\u00a0 [I heard from the students in this school that the judges and teachers all know her, and the score will be high, what should we do? ]After Chu Yin replied [Don\u2019t be afraid], Song Zhaolin\u2019s WeChat also came.[Liang Yueqi invited a foreign teacher. Sister Yin, if you don\u2019t win, it\u2019s okay.][You are still the first in my heart! ]Chu Yin laughed and asked him, [Why did you come to the competition?]Song Zhaolin: [You\u2019re here! Of course, I\u2019ll come!]Chu Yin put away her mobile phone with a smile.Liang Yueqi didn\u2019t put her under much pressure. No matter how good her English was, she was only the level of an ordinary 17-year-old high school student. In their whole grade, except for people like Lu Zhen who lived abroad as a child, no one else could speak English better than her.Liang Yueqi went down the stage with a smile, her eyes going straight to Chu Yin.Chapter 21 \u2013 Win the Competition! (3)Chu Yin felt a little strange then she saw the whole contestant area become quiet.Then, a familiar, clear smell floated to her left.A man sat down in seat no.12.Chu Yin turned her head in silence and looked at the man.The seats in the contest area were full, and the gap was only one palm wide, close enough to hear their seatmate\u2019s breathing.Seeing the astonishment under her eyes, Lu Zhen laughed lightly, the tear mole on the corners of his eye was very clear, and his black eyes were shining: \u201cHello.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026.\u201dDog man.I\u2019ll.kill.Lu Zhen.She couldn\u2019t believe that this dog man would come to participate in the competition!! Was he here to win the championship?? Sure enough, the male lead\u2019s halo was hindering her from completing the task!!The whole contest area blew up in surprise.Although they weren\u2019t familiar with the Huiwen\u2019s school flower, they knew who the school\u2019s apollo was for two years.Lu Zhen, the young heir of the wealthiest company, the most handsome guy.Just by his appearance, the audience, and the contestants were all boiling.After seeing Lu Zhen sitting down, he didn\u2019t even look at Liang Yueqi. Her expression gradually became ugly. Her sight fell on Chu Yin beside him, showing a little displeasure.Chu Yin closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths.If she asked to withdraw from the script, even if she won the championship, she would be judged as a failure by the system. She pursed her lips and thought,\u00a0it\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not afraid of him.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t want to disturb her.It was the first time the two of them had sat close together.Her knee was sticking to his leg while her wide sleeves touched his forearm unconsciously. These all made Lu Zhen\u2019s breathing light and shallow.The light fragrance of Chu Yin lingered around him, and all of Lu Zhen\u2019s manic depressions in the past few days gently smoothed down.This was the magic of the little nerd.After the chaos Lu Zhen triggered, the contestant area became stabilized again. The contestants came on stage one by one before then reaching the 12th.Before Lu Zhen stood up, he suddenly approached Chu Yin: \u201cClassmate, can you cheer me on?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face was tight as she gave a hypocritical smile: \u201cGood luck.\u201d Not!!!Lu Zhen said thanks with a smile and walked on the stage casually. The audience were all staring expectantly.Lu Zhen\u2019s voice was low. When he spoke English, he was as fluent as when he spoke his mother tongue.The young man stood under the spotlight. His facial features were three-dimensional and deep. His black hair and cold fair skin looked exceptionally beautiful. No one could take their eyes off of him.Lu Zhen was comfortable speaking English.Chu Yin had a deep understanding of this in the past few years abroad and often had watched blonde beauties ask for contact information. After they communicated with Lu Zhen, they would be even more enthusiastic.Five minutes later, Lu Zhen stepped down from the stage, and all the girls in the audience went crazy.\u201cThe pronunciation is too excellent, my god, ah ahhhh\u201d\u201cCan you still pay attention to what he is talking about? I stared at the face the whole time!\u201d\u201cThe girls in Huiwen are so lucky. Damn it, I\u2019m so envious.\u201dChu Yin was a little relieved.Although Lu Zhen\u2019s oral English was good, his manuscript was too casual. She didn\u2019t know whether he specially examined or not, or if he had deducted the title at all. If not for his pronunciation, his body and expression were too casual.Chu Yin pursed her lips and went to the stage calmly when she heard her name being called.Liang Yueqi leaned on the back of the chair, smiling disdainfully at her.She was also in the wealthy circle. She knew that Chu Yin, who was brought back from the countryside, got full marks in her midterm English exam.But this didn\u2019t mean she could win in the speech category. Pronunciation, expressions, on-the-spot reaction. These are all important. There was absolutely no opportunity for her to excel.Although her courage to enter the competition was commendable, it was better to have a good foundation to do so.The audience had just experienced Lu Zhen\u2019s performance so they were not interested in the next contestant. Because the stage was too far away, they couldn\u2019t see what she looked like. They just saw that the contest was wearing an old-school uniform.Amid the buzzing sound, Chu Yin stood still on the stage, looking at the audience below, showing a decent smile.Then she started her own speech.From the first sentence, the whole area became quiet.After a while, Liang Yueqi\u2019s expression changed.Where did she learn pronunciation??Why is it so similar to Lu Zhen\u2019s??No \u2013 it is even more sophisticated and pure than Lu Zhen as if it has been used for a long time!In the contestant area, Lu Zhen was stunned for a few seconds and then laughed.Her pronunciation was really similar to his, and there was a subtle resonance that made people\u2019s hearts leap.The audience was also surprised: \u201cI just discovered there\u2019s so many people with\u00a0 American accent now??\u201d\u201cHow can just anyone participate?\u201dFive minutes into her speech, Chu Yin did not make any mistakes. Her tune was stable and excellent until the completion of her speech.After bowing, the whole arena clapped with thunderous applause. Both Jiang Yan and Song Zhaolin were in utter shock.\u201cThe host has performed very well. At present, the scoring data ranks first, which is a step closer to success.\u201dAfter listening, Chu Yin did not return to the contestant area but went out to find an empty classroom to prepare for the second round of impromptu speech.This time, Liang Yueqi didn\u2019t dare to relax anymore, she also hurriedly found a place to prepare for the second round.After the first round was over, the second round would be drawn again. This time, Liang Yueqi was 11, Chu Yin was 12. They were close to each other, but Liang Yueqi suddenly lost confidence.If she couldn\u2019t win the championship\u2026She steadied herself and walked onto the stage.The judges on the stage knew that she was the champion of last year. They weren\u2019t merciful at all. Liang Yueqi\u2019s psychological pressure increased sharply and her palms were full of sweat. In the end, she explained too weakly.Then Chu Yin came, powered up.The judges\u2019 questions were equally sharp.However, sufficient material accumulation and excellent memory played a role at this time. In the face of the problems raised by the examiners, even if they were sharper, Chu Yin could still draw out two or three examples to support her point of view. Her enunciation was clear and organized.After three questions, the examiners expressed their satisfaction.The competition ended at 5:00 p.m., the scores were submitted for statistics and the results were announced on the spot.Lu Zhen was invited to the office.In this city, who didn\u2019t know about the Lu family? After the news of the young master in the Lu family participating in the competition, the organizers were all nervous.After the score was out, Lu Zhen was not the first. But he wrote his own manuscripts, clearly showing that he wanted the award.\u201cYoung Master Lu, you can rest assured that with your level, there is no objection to winning the championship.\u201dLu Zhen raised his eyes and looked at him: \u201cWhat\u2019s my score?\u201dThe organizer carefully said: \u201cThere\u2019s this girl that the judges ranked too high. We all think it\u2019s not reasonable. After the adjustment, you are the first!\u201dLu Zhen looked at him with a smile: \u201cWho?\u201dThe organizer pondered his expression and said, \u201cA girl named Chu Yin who was wearing old school\u2013\u201dBefore he finished, he was suddenly interrupted by coldness.\u201cShe\u2019s deserving of number one. If she isn\u2019t, you won\u2019t be an organizer here again.\u201d\u201cYes, yes!\u201d The organizer was almost paralyzed with fright.\u2026\u2026At the end of the competition, Chu Yin relaxed and strolled to the toilet.It was a smooth day, except for the dog man who killed it suddenly, everything was the same as she expected.Chu Yin was humming. As she turned the corner, she suddenly ran into a person.She was caught off guard and was knocked back. She was, in the second, held by the man tightly.Their two bodies were attached for a short time.The familiar smell, the familiar temperature\u2026. Lu Zhen. Chu Yin immediately reacted.This physical contact, which hadn\u2019t happened for a long time, instantly activated many memories. Chu Yin shuddered for a second and quickly pushed him away.Lu Zhen looked at her.After holding her hand, the temperature still lingered in his palm.The place she hit was suddenly filled with something.His fingertips trembled from excitement.Subconsciously, Lu Zhen wanted to cover up his mistake with some topic. He asked, \u201cDo you think you can win?\u201dChu Yin had just calmed down, but the moment she heard this, she became angry again.Is this dog man provoking me???If I can\u2019t, who can??You??Just then, the announcement rang out: \u201cChu Yin, Lu Zhen, Liang Yueqi, please come to the podium\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014Look at this order, she won the championship!!At the same time, Chu Yin heard a system sound:\u201cDing \u2013 winning championship in the speech contest! Congratulations to the host for getting permission to change a single sentence! You received a special reward [delete card] ~ \u201cLu Zhen lowered his eyes and laughed: \u201cCongratulations.\u201dChu Yin smiled: \u201cThank you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She should study them when she had time. This delete card would be more effective than the previous replacement card. It would be great if she could delete a character directly.\u2014\u2014Deleted the male leadXueji: \u201c*Coughs* That\u2019s dangerous!\u201dChu Yin rolled her eyes in her heart.Now that the results were broadcasted, she had a good reason to leave and turn to the podium. Lu Zhen seemed to be in a trance and didn\u2019t say anything more. He just followed her slowly.Chu Yin hadn\u2019t gone far when she met Liang Yueqi in the corridor.Liang Yueqi lost so much this year. Not only did she fail to win the championship, but she was also robbed of the runner up position by a man she liked.Looking at her, her face was still in shock.Chu Yin shook her head and sighed.This person is too incapable of fighting. Can\u2019t she fight with more passion?Be strong! Make Lu Zhen see your excellence and beauty!!If it doesn\u2019t work, take the initiative to hit him!! Don\u2019t let him bump into me backstage!!Ughh.Chu Yin\u2019s clear and beautiful eyes showed extreme hatred which shocked Liang Yueqi enough that she was left frightened.Liang Yueqi grew up as the eldest lady in an influential family. She had never been looked down upon in this way. She squeezed her skirt and was about to say something, but Chu Yin had already walked past her.Liang Yueqi had another fright.She reached out to stop Lu Zhen and said with red eyes, \u201cLu Zhen, you didn\u2019t come to see me compete?\u201dLu Zhen glanced at her: \u201cI\u2019m here to compete.\u201dLiang Yueqi: \u201cWhy? You never care about these awards.\u201dLu Zhen snorted and wanted to get away from her.Liang Yueqi was always elegant and clever in front of Lu Zhen. She was not the same as the crazy girls in school. This was the reason why Liang Yueqi had not aroused Lu Zhen\u2019s ill feelings towards her.But this time, Liang Yueqi couldn\u2019t help it, and suddenly blurted out: \u201cIs it because of Chu Yin?\u201dAlthough it was absurd, Liang Yueqi\u2019s sixth sense told her that this was the reason. Lu Zhen didn\u2019t even watch her performance speech at all, but when it was Chu Yin who took the stage, Lu Zhen watched her performance from beginning to end!Just as Lu Zhen\u2019s aura cooled down, a trace of anger emerged. \u201cDo you think too highly of yourself?\u201dLiang Yueqi trembled in fright. But Lu Zhen\u2019s reaction affirmed that her guess was right. \u201cLu Zhen, think of your identity. Are you not afraid of Grandfather Lu if he finds out? She\u2019s just a country bump\u2013\u201d\u201c\u2013Shut up,\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s face sank down: \u201cMind your own business.\u201dThis cold treatment directly squeezed her heart.She knew Lu Zhen since she was a child. Although she often didn\u2019t receive any response from him, this was the first time that Lu Zhen treated her with such an attitude.She turned to stare at Lu Zhen\u2019s back, filled with grievances and unwillingness.\u2026\u2026The awards are awarded in the order of the third place, runner up, and champion.Chu Yin successfully won the championship of this xx Cup English Speech Contest. When she came to the stage, the organizer personally presented her with medals and certificates. For some reason, the organizer who came to present her the award was extremely kind to her, like a blooming chrysanthemum.When Chu Yin came to the stage to perform her speech, no one cared.When she came to the stage to receive the award, it attracted the attention of countless people.This young lady of Huiwen had good English pronunciation! She calmly presented her impromptu speech, making her even more beautiful! After the competition, Chu Yin captured several fans in this school.Jiang Yan and Song Zhaolin sat in the audience area. Listening to the rainbow farts of the people around them, their sense of pride rose. They took many photos of Chu Yin with their mobile phones.After all the awards were given, they took a group photo together. Chu Yin stood in the middle, Lu Zhen on the left, and Liang Yueqi on the right, which made her uncomfortable.The photographer commanded, \u201cThat handsome boy on the left, yes, move a bit to the right!\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes, curled up his fingertips slightly, and moved a bit towards the girl.Chu Yin was forced to stay right next to Lu Zhen.Her shoulder only reached his chest, so her body was overpowered by him.Because their breathing intertwined slightly, some of Chu Yin\u2019s memories were instantly revived.She shivered, remembering all the seductive words he said to her in those years while being wrapped by his scent.Dog man.She pursed her lips, her dimples showing on her cheek.\u2014\u2014\u201dClick\u201dThe audience was not yet willing to leave the competition area.\u201cWhat kind of beauty is this\u2026\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell which one of these two is better.\u201d\u201cBoth are beautiful!! Brother and Sister, ahh ahh.\u201dAfter getting off the stage, Chu Yin went straight to Jiang Yan, but she was stopped by Lu Zhen.\u2014\u201dGood student.\u201dThe young man\u2019s voice was low, whilst showing a trace of a smile on his lips.Chu Yin turned back helplessly.Lu Zhen stood a few steps away and laughed: \u201cI\u2019m not a bad student.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026Oh\u201d\u201cSo\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s dark eyes looked at her, \u201cCan you not be afraid of me?\u201dWhen they took the photo just now, she was trembling.Chu Yin was silent for a while.Yes, you are not a bad student.You are still in your embryo stage of developing into a bad one!!Who\u2019s afraid of you?!Bah!!On the way out, Jiang Yan was very excited. She didn\u2019t expect that Chu Yin\u2019s spoken English was so good that she outranked everyone.Jiang Yan emotionally said: \u201cYin Yin, I think you can do anything. You are omnipotent.\u201dSong Zhaolin was beside them since Lu Zhen already went home. He nodded frantically this time, \u201cI agree! Sister Yin, do you think you can win the fencing and skating competitions?Chu Yin really thought about it for a while and replied, \u201cI can\u2019t.\u201dFencing and skating were just a hobby of hers. It was still difficult to win the competition.As they laughed and talked while walking out of school, they were stopped by a few students.Looking at the girls in front of them with cigarettes in their hands, Chu Yin\u2019s delicate eyebrows raised.\u2014\u2014Acquaintances.When Song Zhaolin saw these elder sisters, he remembered the fear of being harassed in the alley that day. His face suddenly paled.The elder sister walked over with an evil smile as she looked at Chu Yin, \u201cDare to come to our territory? I heard you won the prize here?\u201dThe punishment they received in school last time was probably because of this woman. It just so happened that they ran into her today!The students in the school all stopped and watched in secret.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t know how Chu Yin angered them, but he was a man, and he must protect the girls this time. He covered both Chu Yin and Jiang Yan behind him. \u201cIf you have any business, come at me.\u201dMany of the students who gathered had just finished watching the competition. They were a little nervous.How could the little sister who won the prize just now offend them?She wouldn\u2019t be bullied, would she?The elder sister looked at Song Zhaolin while touching her chin, \u201cOh, the handsome guy is here. How many sisters do you want?\u201dAs soon as her voice fell, Chu Yin lightly smiled and pushed Song Zhaolin away, blocking him and Jiang Yan.Then she suddenly said, \u201cHuh? Are you not the same group who played with dog poop in the alley that day?\u201dUnexpectedly, the crowd of onlookers: \u201c???\u201dSong Zhaolin was also surprised: \u201cPlay with dog poop?\u201dThe elder sister suddenly remembered the fear of touching dog poop. Her expression became extremely ugly, \u201cYou, why are you talking nonsense!\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face was sincere, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys like playing with dog poop? This time you have fun!\u201dThe most important thing for these eldest sisters was their reputation. When they were exposed in public, several of them got angry and wanted to beat Chu Yin after throwing the cigarettes in their hands.Suddenly, Chu Yin said in a loud voice, \u201cMy god! Why are you playing with bird poop now!\u201dThe crowd intently looked and saw that there were bird poops on their hands! So colorful and so real!Oh my god! The elder sisters in this school really had this kind of hobby!The faces of several gangsters were green\u2014\u2014Here it is again!This fear of being dominated by shit!What kind of scientific explanation could this possibly have?!!Under the stares of everyone, they couldn\u2019t beat this kind of mocking eyes and finally ran away.Chu Yin clapped her hands with satisfaction. As soon as she saw these people, she changed the cigarettes in their hands to bird poops in the script.She hoped that these elder sisters would cultivate a psychological shadow and would stop making trouble in the future.She turned around and touched the heads of Song Zhaolin and Jiang Yan one by one: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201dThe two were in a daze.The crowd of onlookers howled again.This unchanging aura! This kind of calm demeanor!!On the same day, there were several posts in the forum of the Neighboring School. They were all praises of Chu Yin. She was extremely beautiful. Not only did she win the championship, but also drove away the elder sisters on the campus.Without knowing it, Chu Yin harvested a large number of fans in the Neighboring School.The winning of the speech contest made the English teacher very happy, and she praised Chu Yin as soon as the class started.Chapter 22 \u2013 Setting up Lu Zhen (2)Class 5 also heard that Liang Yueqi, who was last year\u2019s champion, only won third place this time. While the one who got second place was Young Master Lu Zhen.Chu Yin actually managed to beat these two contestants. Even if they didn\u2019t watch the competition, they knew that Chu Yin\u2019s spoken English must be better than everyone in the class.Many of her classmates strangely looked at her.Because of this, some classmates imitated Chu Yin\u2019s behavior. They only sat in their seats to study during break time and asked questions from their teachers. It was as if Chu Yin was their benchmark.Chu Yin didn\u2019t realize this because there was only one thing in her mind right now that made her distressed.Huiwen\u2019s sports event was about to begin. Every student in the class should participate in at least one sport.As a very wealthy aristocratic private school, Huiwen\u2019s sports event was completely different from other ordinary schools. Most schools host their sport event during October when the weather was neither hot nor cold, but for Huiwen, this didn\u2019t matter since they had sports venues that were suitable for all climates.Moreover, the sports hosted in this event were not ordinary. Fencing, skating, basketball, badminton, tennis, and softball were all the sports Huiwen had. Not all schools could cater to these.For this, Huiwen students compete with each other according to the point system. The class with the highest points would be rewarded with ten thousand dollars plus honor medals.The headteacher knew that it would be Chu Yin\u2019s first time to participate so she encouraged her to participate actively.But Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to participate. She had no good memories during this sports event.If she could, she preferred to be a spectator listening to English speeches.In contrast, Song Zhaolin was enthusiastic about the sport\u2019s event.\u201cI don\u2019t if we can beat the international class this year.\u201d He excitedly rubbed his hands, \u201cLast year, we were 20 points short of winning the championship!\u201dChu Yin was in the International Class in her previous life. She knew that the International Class also attached great importance to this activity. Both Class 5 and International Class were the best in the whole grade.\u201cIf Brother Zhen participates in fencing, tennis, and basketball, then winning the championship will be difficult.\u201dAlthough he said this, he was not discouraged, \u201cWe can still turn the tide!\u201dChu Yin only listened to his bragging while doing problem exercises. She didn\u2019t expose him.Lu Zhen was taught fencing and tennis since he was a child. These aristocratic sports were deliberately cultivated by the Lu family. Coupled with the physical stamina of Lu Zhen, ordinary people couldn\u2019t compete with him.After the class ended, the sports committee member, Zhao Yuxiong, walked over with the list.Zhao Yuxiong was a big and tall man. He poked the table, his face a little red, \u201cStudent Chu Yin, do you have any sports you want to participate in\u2026\u201dThe whole class was very active. The application list was almost filled with names.Although Chu Yin\u2019s heart was like iron, she couldn\u2019t say she didn\u2019t want to contribute to the class. \u201cMay I think about it first?\u201dHer eyes were so clear that Zhao Yuxiong\u2019s face instantly blushed harder, \u201cYes, yes!\u201dAfter speaking, he ran away.Chu Yin\u2019s plan of answering more problem exercises was disrupted, so she decided to go out get some water, then come back to continue doing it.While walking to the corner, holding the water bottle, she accidentally saw Lu Zhen again.The boy leaned against the wall and waved at her.Chu Yin took a deep breath and walked over.She stood two meters away and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Zhen came over, lowered his head, and suddenly stuffed something in her ear.Chu Yin was startled and subconsciously wanted to jump away before realizing that it was a headset.Then, Lu Zhen placed a small thing into her hand. The corner of his lips was raised, \u201cI\u2019m giving this to you since you like it.\u201dChu Yin couldn\u2019t react for a long time.Why did Lu Zhen give her this?What?Lu Zhen had been waiting for her for a long time. He didn\u2019t want to look deliberate so he left after giving her the thing.When Lu Zhen left, Chu Yin looked at the pink iPod in her hand. She hesitated for a while before pressing the play button.The first song played was the Great Compassion Mantra. The second was the Mantra of Amitabha. The third was the Medicine Buddha, then was followed with Rebirth Mantra and the Six-Character Daming Mantra.Chu Yin\u2019s hand, which was holding the iPod, slightly trembled.\u2014Is he crazy!!!You don\u2019t know what I like!!!A few minutes later, Chu Yin went back to the classroom with a cold face.She said to Song Zhaolin: \u201cI thought of a way to contribute to the class.\u201dSong Zhaolin immediately looked at her: \u201cWhat is it?\u201dChu Yin sneered.\u2014I\u2019ll make it impossible for Lu Zhen to participate in the sport\u2019s event.Fuck him!!! (shouts) (shouts louder)Chu Yin listened to the Buddha\u2019s Heart Sutra while waiting for two days before finally catching the opportunity in the script.That evening, Lu Zhen would go to a dinner party with his uncle.There was a paragraph in the script that read:\u3010The representative of the Lu family was always Lu Zhen, however in the past two years, Lu Linyuan gradually began to appear on public occasions.Lu Zhen drove his uncle\u2019s car. Because he didn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license, his driving speed was 80 mph. Lu Liyuan and Lu Zhen were close since childhood so they chatted a lot along the way.When they arrived at the venue and got out of the car, someone greeted them.\u3011Chu Yin still remembered Lu Linyuan. Her impression of this handsome uncle of the Lu family was that he was graceful as the wind.I\u2019m sorry, uncle, but blame your nephew for this.She moved her light pen and crossed out a word in the script.Hehe.Lu Linyuan was a low-key person. His car was the same as everyone else\u2019s.Although the outer appearance was low-key and did not exude luxury, the interior was one of the best with extremely high performance.Lu Zhen drove this car many times so he adjusted the driver\u2019s seat to his preference. Lu Linyuan sat on the co-pilot seat and looked over, \u201cI heard you bullied Qiqi? She went home and cried to Mr. Liang.\u201dLu Zhen lowered his head and started the car. He said nonchalantly without denying, \u201cI did.\u201d\u201cAlthough she was wronged, she didn\u2019t speak ill of you.\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes and asked casually, \u201cUncle, have you been close to the Liang family recently?\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s eyebrows twitched and laughed, \u201cI\u2019m just worried about you.\u201dAfter saying that, he sounded like a worried uncle. He moved closer to Lu Zhen, \u201cSeriously, Qiqi is very beautiful. Her family background suits you so much. Why don\u2019t you care about her? What type of girls do you like?\u201dLu Zhen gave a soft pause.\u00a0What do I like?He thought for a while and then the corners of his lips inexplicably raised, \u201cThose who devote themselves to Buddha with great concentration.\u201dLu Linyuan: \u201c\u2026?\u201d\u00a0This is a weird standard.\u201cLet\u2019s go. Slow down. We\u2019re not in a hurry.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLu Zhen put his hand on the steering wheel and stepped on the accelerator.In the next second, the car suddenly flew out. The speedometer directly went up to 180 mph!Lu Linyuan\u2019s whole body was pressed on the back of the chair by recoil.Lu Zhen\u2019s pupils shrunk. Seeing that the front car was about to hit the tree, he adjusted his direction and slammed on the emergency brake.Lu Linyuan\u2019s body was rushed forward again by the sudden break. He was almost strangled by the safety belt.In just a few seconds, they nearly lost their life.When the 1.2-ton car stopped, it suddenly emitted a burnt smell that reached the tip of their noses.The two people in the car fell into silence.They felt so overwhelmed that they couldn\u2019t speak for a while.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart was beating wildly. He managed to barely calm down before stiffly turning his head, \u201cIf I said it was the car that moved on its own, would you believe it?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am Not Fit to Be the Male Lead\u2019s First LoveCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23 \u2013 Don\u2019t mess with her!(1)Because of that night, Young Master Lu didn\u2019t drive again.The speed surge happened outside the Lu family\u2019s mansion, so the sound of the car flying out was heard in the quiet high-end villa area. This incident even alarmed Grandfather Lu.His son died in a car accident. If something happened to his grandson, he would probably have a heart attack on the spot.\u201cYou\u2019re not really hurt?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dLu Zhen was completely calm at this time, quietly thinking about numerous possibilities in his heart.The person who dared to do this was very bold. As the sole heir of the Lu family, of course, this would be investigated thoroughly. Once they found out who did this, it would absolutely not be taken lightly.Lu Zhen thought for a moment, and somehow felt the familiar sense of absurdity.The degree of absurdity was similar to the knife that fell down the sky\u2026?Grandfather Lu babbled a few words before turning his head to look at Lu Linyuan. \u201cLu Zhen doesn\u2019t have a driver\u2019s license yet but you always allow him to drive. What if something really happens?!\u201dLu Linyuan grinned and said, \u201cIt will definitely not happen next time.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cIt has nothing to do with uncle. I\u2019ll go with uncle later to the party.\u201dThe uncle and nephew pair was sent to the dinner party by a driver, while the car was sent away for inspection.This time, the speed of the car was 40 mph. The million-dollar luxury car slowly drove towards the destination. The scene was like a king parading in a chariot.Seeing that the dinner party\u2019s appointed time was near, the driver glanced in the rearview mirror and asked, \u201cDo you need me to speed up a little bit?\u201dHe was waiting for Lu Zhen for instructions.Lu Zhen was silent for a moment: \u201cNo need.\u201dLu Linyuan also had lingering fears, \u201cThis speed is enough.\u201d\u2026It was just too scary.By the time they arrived at the venue, the dinner party had already begun. As soon as the representative of the Lu family showed up, someone greeted Lu Zhen immediately.\u201cYoung Master Lu, this way, please!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Lu, long time no see!\u201dWhen the cool and upright young man appeared in the hall in a top-level customized suit, he immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention.The young man looked lazily, not responding to anyone. Behind this young man stood the huge empire of the Lu family, whose wealth and power gilded him with the best of the best.Liang Yueqi, who was at the railing on the second floor, blushingly looked at Lu Zhen. But when she thought of his attitude to her previously, there was another burst of anger.Grandfather Liang took his granddaughter\u2019s hand and asked, \u201cDid you say that Young Master Lu likes the girl who was picked up by the Chu family?\u201dLiang Yueqi didn\u2019t pretend to be mature and steady in front of her grandfather, \u201cAlthough Lu Zhen didn\u2019t say it, I feel like he does.\u201dGrandfather Liang snorted. He comforted his granddaughter, \u201cQiqi, you don\u2019t need to care about the girl in the Chu family.\u201dLiang Yueqi was stunned.\u201cThe two heads of the Chu family are not farsighted enough. Their development model is unstable and they might collapse someday. Even if they can maintain the status quo, they can\u2019t compare with our Liang family. Lu Zhen\u2019s grandfather knows this better than us.\u201dLiang Yueqi\u2019s depression suddenly dispersed.Because she lost the competition against Chu Yin, she had a ridiculous inferiority complex for a while.\u00a0Grandfather was right. What is Chu Yin\u2019s family background compared to hers? Not to mention, Chu Yin lived in the countryside for more than ten years, which was different from her aristocratic family.When Grandfather Liang saw his granddaughter, he understood and showed a loving smile, \u201cSo, don\u2019t treat that girl in the Chu family as your opponent.\u201d\u201cIf Lu Zhen makes such a wrong choice, it only shows that he is not qualified to be the heir of the Lu empire.\u201dLiang Yueqi showed a knowing smile: \u201cI know, grandfather.\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin looked forward to the day Song Zhaolin\u2019s microphone would preach good news~Such as, Lu Zhen being hospitalized due to a car accident and missing the sports event.Or Lu Zhen having a broken leg and having to go to school on crutches.Unfortunately, when school started on Monday, Song Zhaolin told her with a look of amazement that Lu Zhen was sent to school today in an S-GUARD bulletproof car. The safety factor of the car equals that of the country\u2019s president.\u201cBut I think brother Zhen is fine. Why is he suddenly so alert?\u201d Song Zhaolin touched his head in confusion.Chu Yin snorted in her heart.Damn the male lead\u2019s halo, bah!Got lucky!However, judging by the level of defense Lu Zhen prepared, he must have been frightened that day. At such a thought, Chu Yin\u2019s dark heart was enlightened.The Lu family must have dug three feet to find the person responsible for this.But hey, hey, hey, you\u2019ll never find them~These days, the students of Huiwen were excited about the sports event. The class was eagerly discussing, who signed up for what, who would win the championship this year, and the flag bearer of each class.Chu Yin was completely unmoved as she listened to the class as usual. After all, when the sports event ends, it won\u2019t be long before the final exam, which was more important to Chu Yin than these activities.During the political class, the teacher analyzed and explained new concepts in detail then announced to the class to recite them\u00a01.Song Zhaolin was drowsy, but suddenly woke up with a pale complexion. Although he couldn\u2019t recite it, he knew the teacher wouldn\u2019t scold him. But he would be ordered to copy it a dozen times!!Not only him but other students in the class who listened to the teacher\u2019s discussion couldn\u2019t help but cry. Understanding is understanding, it didn\u2019t mean they could recite it directly!Everyone frantically opened the book, trying to use the last few seconds to write down more words.Chu Yin wasn\u2019t in a hurry. When she received the textbook, she casually turned the pen and waited for the teacher to dictate.During the dictation, Song Zhaolin squeezed his fingers and racked his brain. His deskmate was silently answering, not even fazed.Song Zhaolion\u2019s back was straight as he slowly tilted quietly. He gradually moved close to Chu Yin, his head and waist were inching towards her. His neck stretched out as long as he could as his eyes widened to look for answers.\u2014\u201dSong Zhaolin! What are you doing?\u201dThe teacher saw him sneaking glances for answers, \u201cFocus on yourself. It\u2019s bad to look at other people\u2019s papers! A big young man leaning on a little girl\u2019s seat is not good to look at!\u201dThe whole class burst into laughter.Chu Yin quickly filled the dictation paper, then pointed her fingers to the table as she leaned her arm.Song Zhaolin was so moved that he almost cried: Dad!!!When all the papers were submitted, the teacher stood on the platform and flipped the papers. Then when he saw Chu Yin\u2019s paper, he smiled with satisfaction, \u201cYes, a student in this class can still write everything silently. Everyone should learn from Chu Yin!\u201dAll the students in Class 5 looked back at her.They didn\u2019t know why but they were not surprised seeing this happened again.But what kind of brain did she have to memorize everything she just learned! That\u2019s too unacceptable!Because Fu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t answer the question, a hint of jealousy arose in her heart. Why did she (Chu Yin) have a good memory? Did she study in advance?Chu Yin: Guilty but chose to keep quiet.jpgEver since she added buffs to herself, she didn\u2019t have any sour legs and waist anymore\u00a02. It was refreshing to memorize everything so easily.Thinking about it, she shouldn\u2019t feel guilty. She only promoted herself to a \u2018good\u2019 level.If she encountered a description of herself in the future, she must reform herself.When the class was over, the students were free of trouble. They continued to talk about the sports event.\u201cSo who is the flag bearer of the class?\u201d Someone asked Zhao Yuxiong, the sports committee member.Zhao Yuxiong was embarrassed about this matter.Huiwen\u2019s sports event required each class to design a flag logo then select a person to raise the flag for display.By tradition, each class would choose a student with the best \u2018face value\u2019 appearance.Last year, Fu Mingxuan, the class flower of Class 5, was the one who held the flag. But this year\u2026Zhao Yuxiong secretly looked at Chu Yin in the corner of the window, his face was a little hot.Chu Yin was more suitable if it was according to appearance.The boys had discussed it many times in private. They all feel that the current class flower should no longer be Fu Mingxuan. Chu Yin was not only a class\u2019s flower but also the school\u2019s flower.Someone said, \u201cFu Mingxuan should be the flag bearer this year since she has experience.\u201dThen someone objected: \u201cBut Chu Yin is more beautiful!\u201dXing Lan looked at the boys\u2019 behavior and was irritated. Before, Zhao Yuxiong and others were busy circling Fu Mingxuan, but now they had become Chu Yin\u2019s licking dogs??Fu Mingxuan was also upset. She had been waiting for two days for Zhao Yuxiong to tell her to be the flag bearer.She heard from her friends that Chu Qiuqiu became the flag bearer of International Class. Since she was the flag bearer of Class 5 last year, wouldn\u2019t it be a slap in the face if she wasn\u2019t the bearer this year?Fu Mingxuan turned to ask Zhao Yuxiong with a bad tone: \u201cHas the flag bearer determined already?\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Zhao Yuxiong hesitated for a moment. Just as Chu Yin passed by from the back of the classroom, he quickly stopped Chu Yin: \u201cWait a minute!\u201d\u201cThis flag bearer has been decided by the class. Do you want to be the flag bearer, Chu Yin?\u201dFu Mingxuan tightly stared at Chu Yin.Hearing about the flag-bearer, a short period of unpleasant memories came to Chu Yin\u2019s mind.After she became the school\u2019s flower in her last life, she naturally was promoted to the flag bearer position of the International Class. Some girls thought that she liked to show off and used pathetic means to bully her.Chapter 23 \u2013 Don\u2019t mess with her!(2)Chu Yin remembered that she was called to a classroom by a student pretending to be a teacher. As soon as she entered the door, she was greeted with a bucket of ice water, then the door was locked from the outside. She stayed in the cold classroom for a long time until Lu Zhen came.Chu Yin suspected that this plot was needed for the characters\u2019 emotional factors. At that time when Lu Zhen broke the door and calmly took off his coat and put it on her body, Chu Yin felt that the young man was extremely handsome.Since the 17-year-old Chu Yin was ignorant, she could excuse her slight affection for Lu Zhen once, but not twice. The young Chu Yin didn\u2019t know she would get entangled with this person until death.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know what that day meant to Lu Zhen, but if the plot would repeat itself, she must change herself.What emotional factors, let\u2019s just play with eggs \u00a0[/mfn] In other words, \u2018let\u2019s just believe in ourself\u2019 / self-reliant [/mfn]Chu Yin looked at Zhao Yuxiong and shook her head, \u201cNo intention. I don\u2019t want it.\u201dZhao Yuxiong was disappointed but the problem was now resolved, \u201cThen, this year\u2019s flag bearer is still Fu Mingxuan.\u201dFu Mingxuan secretly breathed a sigh of relief but felt she had picked up something Chu Yin didn\u2019t want, so she felt very depressed.\u201cSince you don\u2019t want to be a flag bearer, did you pick any sports?\u201d Fu Mingxuan asked.Xing Lan covered her mouth and snickered, \u201cThis school specializes in sports like fencing and skating. People like Chu Yin who\u2019s from the countryside wouldn\u2019t know how to play.\u201dFu Mingxuan also laughed, \u201cIf only the school included sports where everyone can participate\u2026\u201dThe students felt embarrassed for Chu Yin.Although Fu Mingxuan said this harshly, looking at the way Chu Yin usually dresses\u2026it didn\u2019t seem like she would know any high-end sports.Zhao Yuxiong awkwardly looked at Chu Yin. It was he who stopped her just now and initiated talking to her, but as a result, she was ridiculed.But the girl standing in front of him didn\u2019t have a trace of annoyance on her face. She was calm and beautiful as ever.Chu Yin raised her eyebrows and asked Fu Mingxuan, \u201cWhat did you pick?\u201dFu Mingxuan subconsciously replied, \u201cBilliards.\u201dChu Yin nodded and turned to Zhao Yuxiong: \u201cis there still a spot in billiards?\u201dZhao Yuxiong was inexplicably affected by her aura and replied stupidly, \u201cYes.\u201dChu Yin raised her chin and snapped her finger: \u201cThen I\u2019ll choose this sport.\u201dAfter speaking, she turned to leave.While walking, she sighed.\u2014Class participation, she is clearly doing it ah!Alas, it\u2019s a pity that no one knew of the so-called \u2018participation\u2019 Chu Yin was referring\u00a01.After Chu Yin left, Fu Mingxuan recovered and asked Xing Lan, \u201cWhat did she mean just now?\u201dShe said she signed up for billiards, and then Chu Yin said she wanted to play billiards, too? Is this funny??Was she provoking her?!Fu Mingxuan was so angry that she walked out of the classroom furious. Then she suddenly ran into Liang Yueqi as she turned the corner.These two people were regarded as rivals in love. At this time, both of them looked at each other.Fu Mingxuan laughed: \u201cYueqi? I heard that you placed third in speech completion this year. How come you didn\u2019t beat Chu Yin?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d Liang Yueqi\u2019s sore spot was poked. Of course, she didn\u2019t accept it without talking back, \u201cYou study so well, how come she beat you in the result rankings?\u201dFu Mingxuan: \u201c\u2026\u201dThey were silent for a few seconds before thinking of a good idea.They both lost to Chu Yin at their own home\u00a02.\u2026What is this!!Liang Yueqi took the lead and smiled at Fu Mingxuan. \u201cDid you know that Lu Zhen likes her?\u201dFu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t control her volume: \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cHow can it be?? Don\u2019t spread rumors!!\u201dLiang Yueqi: \u201cI have my own channel. If you don\u2019t believe it, do you want to make a bet?\u201dFu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t accept this fact at all. She immediately asked, \u201cWhat kind of bet?\u201dLiang Yueqi leaned in her ears and whispered, \u201cIf Lu Zhen won\u2019t save her, he doesn\u2019t like her. If he saves her\u2026\u201dFu Mingxuan looked at her: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you would do such a thing.\u201dShe also needed to confirm whether her guess was right.Fu Mingxuan thought of Chu Yin\u2019s provocation in the classroom just now and replied while sneering: \u201cIn this case, it\u2019s better to have fun.\u201d\u201cHow interesting?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dTwo girls hid in the corner of the corridor, whispering for a long time.Song Zhaolin chose four sports for this event\u2013Softball, ice hockey, badminton, and basketball.As soon as the application list was handed in, he wandered to the international class to inquire about military information.\u201cBrother Zhen, brother Zhen, what have you reported?\u201d\u201cBasketball,\u201d Lu Zhen said lazily.Song Zhaolin widened his eyes and said in surprise, \u201cOnly one?\u201dTan Ke shook his head and sighed, \u201cLast year, it was hard to convince Brother Zhen to participate in the games, so this year, don\u2019t make him change his mind!\u201dHe was worried. If Lu Zhen wouldn\u2019t participate, they surely would not win against Class 5.Lu Zhen raised his head and glanced at Song Zhaolin, seemingly wanting to ask him.\u00a0Which sport did Chu Yin choose?She\u2019s probably not interested in these.Little nerd only likes to study.Lu Zhen took a breath and didn\u2019t know how to ask him.But fortunately, Song Zhaolin was a chatterbox. Before Lu Zhen could ask, he spilled the beans, \u201cBrother Zhen, why are you so inactive? Hahaha! You\u2019re not as good as my deskmate. She chose billiards. Although she only picked one, I know she\u2019s very good at it!\u201dLu Zhen suddenly raised his eyebrows.\u201cIs she going to participate in the sports event?\u201dSong Zhaolin naively replied, \u201cYes, Sister Yin is very active! She also told me she wants to contribute to the class!\u201dLu Zhen suddenly smiled.After inquiring about the military situation, Song Zhaolin left happily.Lu Zhen reached out his hand and hooked his finger towards Tan Ke.\u201cBring the application form.\u201dHe took the pen and refilled his name in both fencing and tennis.Tan Ke was excited: \u201cDamn. Brother Zhen, are you going to participate?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cYes.\u201dSince she\u2019ll be watching.It was finally the opening ceremony for the sport\u2019s event.Huiwen\u2019s gymnasium was very large. Most girls wore shorts skirts to look pretty, but Chu Yin was still wearing an old loose school uniform with a jacket wrapped around her. She sat at the back of the gymnasium.At the end of the principal\u2019s speech, the student representative spoke\u2013Gu Qiuze. He was invited by the school to speak.Although third year students did not participate in most sports, the school mandated them to participate in basketball.As soon as Gu Qiuze came on stage, the audience began to scream.\u201cSo handsome, so handsome, so handsome \u2013\u201c\u201cSenior Gu can also be the school\u2019s apollo~\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in love, ah, ah!\u201dGu Qiuze was indeed the type that girls all want. He was gentle and elegant. When he stood on the podium and spoke, the people felt the spring breeze blowing.Even Jiang Yan, who was sitting next to Chu Yin, could not help but push her glasses, \u201cSenior Gu is really handsome.\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dAfter Gu Qiuze\u2019s speech was over, the girls were still over their heads.Then it reached the most anticipated event, the flag bearers were about to appear.The flag bearers had to pass the teachers and students before describing the meaning behind their flag. Besides the explanation, it was more important that they look better than the other flag bearers.When Fu Mingxuan walked over with a smile while raising the flag, Class 5 naturally gave their class a lot of face. They roared and clapped wildly.She wore a close-fitting skirt, showing her concave figure and slender legs. This attracted people\u2019s attention.Later, when Chu Qiuqiu walked through the stage, the international class also offered their roaring claps.But some people recognized her, \u201cPfft. Is this not the student who did a snake dance that day\u2013\u201d\u201cI also remember hahaha! She could become famous for it!\u201d\u201cWhenever I think about it, I couldn\u2019t help but laugh!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not me. It\u2019s not my business.Throughout the opening ceremony, the demon (Lu Zhen) didn\u2019t do anything. Chu Yin breathed a sigh of relief.The fencing match was up next. Chu Yin was not interested, especially when she heard people screaming Lu Zhen\u2019s name. Both Chu Yin and Jiang Yan planned to go back to the classroom to do some problem exercises.However, just after getting out of the gymnasium, a teacher-like person came to her and stopped her, \u201cAre you Chu Yin from 2nd year, Class 5? Billiards players need to go to the third classroom of the second floor.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt has come.Chu Yin smiled: \u201cOkay.\u201dShe walked up the stairs then directly knocked on the system.The script stated:\u3010\u2026The door of the third classroom on the second floor was open as if someone was waiting for her. At this time, Chu Yin didn\u2019t know that it was a trap carefully designed by Liang Yueqi and Fu Mingxuan.\u3011Although the location and characters had changed, it was still the same thing that happened in her previous life.And seeing the roles of Fu Mingxuan and Liang Yueqi, Chu Yin understood.In all likelihood, it was because of the dog man Lu Zhen.Although she had nothing to do with Lu Zhen in this life, the hostility and malice of women really didn\u2019t make any sense.But Chu Yin had always been confused because of this. Why not go to Lu Zhen instead of her??What kind of logic is this?? Can they have Lu Zhen if they do this???The two love rivals couldn\u2019t reconcile with their suspicions and decided to work together against her. Now, they estimated that she was on the second floor.Chu Yin kept walking and quietly went up to the third floor. She sat down the stairs.The next paragraph in the script was a series of operations they planned after entering the door.\u201cHost, do you want to use [delete card]?\u201dChu Yin asked, \u201cHow to use it?\u201dXueji explained: \u201cYou can delete a plot in a script with a fixed number of words. The remaining plot description will automatically connect to continue the plot.\u201dChu Yin understood.Although it was not as bad as deleting a character, it was quite useful to delete a certain plot.Xueji: \u201cdo you want to use it? \u201cChu Yin touched her chin, \u201cNo.\u201dSince her behavior was not controlled by the script, she could directly avoid this. And even if it\u2019s easy to delete it directly, it\u2019s not her style~The little devil\u2019s wings fluttered again as she showed an angelic smile. She crossed the sentence before the [ trap ] .\u201cUse [change sentence] permission.\u201dThen she wrote stroke by stroke\u2014\u2014\u3010But by mistake, Lu Zhen took it all.\u3011Go on, my friends, go get the man!Good luck!!3\u51b2\u9e2d\u2026\u2026Inside the gymnasium.Before changing his protective clothing, Lu Zhen glanced across the stands of Class 5.Up and down, there was no figure.Lu Zhen frowned and strode out of the field. When he met Song Zhaolin, he asked directly: \u201cWhere is Chu Yin?\u201dSong Zhaolin was dumbfounded and subconsciously replied, \u201cI heard she was called to the second floor\u2026\u201dLu Zhen bypassed him and went upstairs.Song Zhaolin stood there and scratched his head.How did he know that Sister Yin went to the second floor? No, Brother Zhen, why is he going to Chu Yin? No, didn\u2019t Tan Ke said Brother Zhen is going to take part in the fencing competition?Song Zhaolin: ???There were so many question marks floating on his head now.Lu Zhen strode up the second floor and saw the door of the third room open.There was no one in the corridor, only his clear footsteps could be heard.Lu Zhen went to the open door and went in unprepared.At this moment, someone suddenly came out of the empty corridor and slammed the door shut. The bucket of water on the top of the door clattered.Lu Zhen was drenched by the water when it fell from the door.With a \u2018click\u2019, the door was locked behind him.A deliberately lowered voice laughed wildly, \u201cHahahaha! Let\u2019s see if Lu Zhen will come to save you!\u201d-Inside the door-Lu Zhen raised his hand and slowly lifted up his wet hair.Shit.\u201cI\u2019m the fucking Lu Zhen.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Lu Zhen briefly thought about life.The ice water trickled down, leaving a puddle of water on the ground. He only had a thin shirt on his body, which was now soaked and clung to him.After a minute of thinking, Lu Zhen still couldn\u2019t understand the logic behind this. He took a deep breath and turned to look at the door.Just now, the voice was deliberately suppressed. It was not someone he was close to and he failed to recognize who it was. But he understood one thing, this person didn\u2019t intend to lock him up.Who does this person want to lock?Fu Mingxuan, who was outside, was dumbfounded.The voice inside the door clearly penetrated her eardrum. Fu Mingxuan was sure she didn\u2019t hear wrong\u2014How can it be Lu Zhen?!?!Where is Chu Yin?? Didn\u2019t she order that person to call Chu Yin??If Lu Zhen pursues this further, she would be finished!!At this time, Lu Zhen\u2019s cold voice came through the door again, \u201cWho should I save?\u201dFu Mingxuan shuddered. Now, she was glad that the door in front of her didn\u2019t have any cat\u2019s eyes. She froze for a moment before making a decision\u2013Run away, run.Can\u2019t let Lu Zhen know that she did it!! Besides, it wasn\u2019t her idea!Fu Mingxuan ran to a certain place and hid, only to find that Liang Yueqi, the little bitch, discovered that something was wrong and had run away long ago. When she realized that she was completely used as a gunman, her teeth gritted\u00a0 with anger. Love rivals couldn\u2019t join forces!Hearing the footsteps sound of running downstairs, Chu Yin, who was sitting on the stairs, was stunned.Ran away?Xueji: \u201cIt seems so, host.\u201dChu Yin leaned over the third-floor window and saw Fu Minxuan sneaking away. Then she sat back on the steps with her chin in her palm.This situation had an unexpected and inexplicable hilarity to it.Lu Zhen, the young master of the Lu family, who would later take over the Lu family empire, was trapped in the cold classroom like a drenched rat.Chu Yin pursed her lips and wanted to laugh.However, as the culprit herself, she had no conscience at all. Chu Yin raised her slender fingers and pressed the dimples of her cheek with her backhand.But it\u2019s still funny.Xueji: \u201cIf you want to laugh, just laugh.\u201dChu Yin sat for a long time, but no one came to the second floor. Therefore, it\u2019s proven that these women were cruel. They knew that they locked up the person they liked, but to save themselves, they disappeared like scumbags.Chu Yin came down from the third floor and took a look at the corridor on the second floor, suspecting that Lu Zhen might still be locked up.Forget it, she still had a bit of conscience. Today, Lu Zhen would be granted her pity.Although she couldn\u2019t get away from this dog man in her previous life, Lu Zhen did come to save her.Chu Yin silently walked to the third classroom. She had a good plan. She would gently twist the door lock and run away. This could be considered as her doing her best.But just as she walked to the door quietly, she suddenly heard a \u201cboom\u2013\u201c.Chu Yin was so scared that she clung to the wall.Immediately afterward, there was another loud bang. This time the door panel directly flew out and hit the wall with a \u201cbang!\u201dLu Zhen kicked the door open.Outside the door, Chu Yin stood there with a dazed expression.The two people were caught off guard.Lu Zhen\u2019s thin shirt was still wet even after being wrung dry. His wet hair was parted back of his head, revealing his cold white forehead.He looked at her for a few seconds, then suddenly raised his eyebrows and laughed.\u201cWas it you?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dWait, wait?!Don\u2019t misunderstand! It\u2019s not me!!!\u2026\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me.\u201d Chu Yin followed Lu Zhen one meter behind, \u201cClassmate, you misunderstood.\u201dLu Zhen had no temper at all.He walked slowly with his hands in his pocket, waiting for her.\u201cFollow me and have a look at the surveillance.\u201dThere was a smile on his lips, but his voice was very low.The autumn wind gently swept the campus at this time. Lu Zhen\u2019s competition had already ended.For the first time in his life, Lu Zhen felt that walking was such an interesting thing.Chu Yin was filled with regret.Although the little genius changed the plot, the car had overturned her this day.So\u2014\u2014Is conscience useful!! Can conscience be eaten!!Why did she try to save the male lead who has the halo!!Chu Yin ingrained a lesson deep into her bones.She explained in anger, \u201cI was just passing by. I was called by someone\u2026\u201dLu Zhen stopped and looked back at her, \u201cBy whom?\u201dChu Yin only wanted to wash clean and not be involved in any emotional entanglement with Lu Zhen. \u201cIt was a teacher\u2013and I went to the wrong floor.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows were raised, \u201cSo it\u2019s like this.\u201dHe also knew that the voice outside the door couldn\u2019t be Chu Yin.But\u2026finally, he got a connection with her. And didn\u2019t want to let this opportunity go.There was even a voice in his heart, humbly hoping that she had done it.This way they would have more connections.They walked quietly to the school\u2019s security office. After a while, Lu Zhen asked softly, \u201cChu Yin, why didn\u2019t you watch the game?\u201dChu Yin felt that she was being suspected so she replied cleverly, \u201cI wanted to go back and do my homework.\u201dA smile appeared in Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes.\u00a0Worthy of being a little nerd.When they arrived at the security office, the person on duty shook his head quickly when he heard they wanted to watch the surveillance, \u201cNo, this is against school\u2019s regulations. The surveillance can\u2019t be given casually\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, the school director came over in a hurry and slapped him on the shoulder, \u201cIf Young Master Lu wants to see it, show it to him!\u201dOf course, the person on duty had heard the name of Young Master Lu, but he didn\u2019t expect the real deal to be in front of him. He quickly transferred the surveillance they wanted.Chu Yin secretly rolled her eyes from on the side. The dog man has privileges everywhere. Bah.After adjusting the computer, the person on duty stood up from the chair, and respectfully asked Lu Zhen to sit down.Lu Zhen waved his hand: \u201cNo.\u201dChu Yin was next to him. They stood together in front of the computer. Because the security room was small, the distance between them was small. Lu Zhen subconsciously clenched his fists.She smells so good.Chu Yin was eager to wash her sins and didn\u2019t care about anything else. She leaned slightly and stared at the screen closely.Because the time was not accurate, the first few minutes of the surveillance were boring. After a while, Lu Zhen finally appeared in the corridor of the surveillance. He walked along the corridor and to the opened room.This was a scene Chu Yin hadn\u2019t seen. Now that she saw it, she wanted to laugh again.She did well arranging this dog man to her pit.Her lips were quickly pursed, knowing that the next scene was the turning point.As soon as Lu Zhen walked into the door, a figure suddenly appeared from outside. With a big wave of the person\u2019s hand, she smashed the door shut and locked the door.Although the surveillance video was pixelated, Fu Mingxuan\u2019s appearance could vaguely be identified.Through the evidence, it was confirmed. Chu Yin straightened up happily and quickly disassociated herself from Lu Zhen, \u201cSee, it\u2019s really not me!\u201dI didn\u2019t lock it! (Although I planned all this).Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes lowered.Whenever he looked at her, she would always have a dull and well-behaved appearance. At this moment, her uncontrollable excitement made her beautiful eyes shine like falling stars.Lu Zhen also laughed, \u201cWell, indeed not you.\u201dThe twinkling light of the stars was so hot that Lu Zhen felt his heart burn.Chu Yin thanked the man on duty and didn\u2019t say too much as she quickly left the security office.As soon as she stepped down the stairs, she saw Song Zhaolin hurrying over.\u201cWhy are you here? I have so many questions!\u201d Song Zhaolin looked suspiciously at Chu Yin and Lu Zhen, who came behind her, \u201cWhat did you two do?\u201dDidn\u2019t Brother Zhen hate his deskmate before? How did they know each other??Chu Yin smiled and said, \u201cNothing.\u201dSong Zhaolin saw Lu Zhen and said, \u201cBrother Zhen, did you go and take a bath?\u201dLu Zhen looked a little embarrassed, but since he was in a good mood, he replied, \u201cI guess.\u201dSong Zhaolin was dumbfounded.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to stay and chat with them, so she said, \u201cI\u2019ll go back to the classroom first.\u201dSong Zhaolin was immediately distracted, \u201cHey, don\u2019t\u2013Sister Yin, the competition just started, you can come and watch it together with me!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cI\u2026\u201dLu Zhen behind her, suddenly opened his mouth to call her: \u201c\u2014Good student.\u201dChu Yin had no choice but to look back: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Zhen looked at her deeply, and the corners of his lips smiled: \u201cI\u2019ll be participating in the match. Can you do me favor? Help me watch the person on the surveillance.\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s expression became even more suspicious: \u201cWho? Who? What happened!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen Dog Man who\u2026who wants to help you!!!!After Lu Zhen finished speaking, he pulled Song Zhaolin away from Chu Yin. Then he patted him on the shoulder before turning to the gym changing room to change into protective clothing.Although Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t get the meaning, because of his burning heart filled with gossips, he stayed behind and followed Chu Yin.\u201cWhy do you not care about our team\u2019s honor and reputation?\u201d Song Zhaolin babbled, utterly losing his temper.\u201cShut up and hurry.\u201d\u201cWho is the person that Brother Zhen asked you to watch?\u201d Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t help but ask eagerly, \u201cNo. I\u2019m here but why did he ask you for help?\u201dChu Yin was helpless: \u201cCuriosity kills the cat. You ask less.\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s eyes rolled round and round, thinking about the appearance of his Brother Zhen and his Sister Yin, and finally gave a reasonable guess: \u201cDid you two commit adultery?!\u201dChapter 24 \u2013 Not me!! (2)Chu Yin was ascending the stairs and almost fell.Where\u2019s my knife. Where\u2019s my knife!\u201cThat\u2019s an absurd situation!\u201d She replied, \u201cMy adultery is only studying. Isn\u2019t it far more worthy than a man?!\u201dSong Zhaolin covered his head and sobbed.So heartless! As expected of his Sister Yin!!!But Song Zhaolin still felt that Brother Zhen and Sister Yin had a little secret behind his back, so he had been observing secretly.When Jiang Yan saw Chu Yin came back, she was a little surprised, \u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201dChu Yin hadn\u2019t spoken yet when Song Zhaolin mysteriously said behind her: \u201cThere is a special mission!\u201dJiang Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin said, \u201cDon\u2019t pay attention to him. I\u2019ll just sit down for a while.\u201dJiang Yan nodded and cleared her seat, \u201cLu Zhen is about to play. Everyone is excited.\u201dEven if she was a studious person, she knew how attractive Lu Zhen was.But Chu Yin wasn\u2019t interested.The Lu family deliberately cultivated this aristocratic sport fencing. Although Lu Zhen\u2019s level was not up to the professional level, it was more than enough to beat these Huiwen\u2019s students. Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to watch the dog man\u2019s glorifying scene.She glanced and saw Fu Mingxuan sitting on the side, her expression a little dazed. She would usually grab the railings excitedly, but now her abnormality was obvious. She couldn\u2019t conceal her guilt.Chu Yin glanced across the aisle of the International Class.Liang Yueqi looked calm. While she watched the game, she would also communicate with her classmates.In this way, Liang Yueqi\u2019s rank was much higher than Fu Mingxuan.Soon, Lu Zhen came on the stage.A pure white protective suit with chest armor and arm protection didn\u2019t look bloated on him. On the contrary, it showed his wide shoulders, narrow waist, and long legs. Lu Zhen held a mask in his hand but did not put it on. His plain sight glanced across the stands.All the girls started screaming.\u201cAh, ah, ah, he\u2019s looking here!\u201d\u201cDid he just look at me?!\u201d\u201cTreat your eyes if you have any problems! Ah, ah, ah, so handsome~\u201dChu Yin covered her ears and glanced aside in despair.Then found that Song Zhaolin\u2019s fierce howls were louder than the girls\u2019.\u2014\u2014\u201dBrother Zhen! Great! Brother Zhen! Invincible!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin collapsed on the stand in despair.At the beginning of the game, Lu Zhen\u2019s face could not be seen under his mask. His offensive movements were clean, his block was very standard, and his attack and defense distance were maintained quite well.Go forward, press the wrist, hit, score.The opponent couldn\u2019t stand it at all. As Chu Yin expected, the opponent was completely beaten.The screams of all the girls in the school never stopped.There were even quite a few high school seniors who secretly came to watch Lu Zhen\u2019s game.Lu Zhen easily won the fencing competition.Song Zhaolin was so excited that he began to worry: \u201cit\u2019s over. Brother Zhen is going to be the champion again this year. What should I do? Class 5 will not be able to beat the international class\u2019 score again\u2026\u201dChu Yin was expressionless.In the field, Lu Zhen took off his mask.The boy shook his black hair slightly, his lips pursed as he raised his eyes and glanced across the stands of Class 5.Those who knew the dispute between the two classes regarded this as a provocation.The girls in Class 5 screamed and the boys were boiling with blood.Song Zhaolin clenched his fists: \u201cEven if it is\u00a0 steamed buns we\u2019re fighting for, we will still definitely work hard!!\u201dChu Yin said with cooperation: \u201cGood luck!\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cSister Yin, you must strive for success in the billiards match tomorrow.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s tone was perfunctory, \u201cHmmm.\u201dBesides the billiards match, she would work harder in other places!Work hard to contribute to the class (makes a fist)\u2026\u2026After Lu Zhen left the stage, the girls in the stands stood up and were about to leave.But at this moment, two security personnel suddenly stepped onto the stands, walked to Fu Mingxuan, and said a few words.Then, the people saw that Fu Mingxuan stood up pale and followed them away.A group of people around was guessing what happened to Fu Mingxuan.Things then got better after a while! The two security personnel came up again in the stands. This time, they went to Liang Yueqi.Chu Yin touched her chin, thinking that this was Lu Zhen\u2019s work. The efficiency of the school was really high.Soon some testimonies came out. Several people saw Lu Zhen returning to the stadium in wet clothes.Because the subject was Lu Zhen, the subject was accelerated instantly. A student then posted a thread in the forum.[For love and hate, it gradually became perverted? What kind of drama is this?]Anonymous 1: *eating melon seeds*Anonymous 2: So what about Liang Yueqi?Anonymous 3: Tsk tsk. Although Miss Liang didn\u2019t make it clear, didn\u2019t she always regard herself as the future daughter-in-law of the Lu family?Anonymous 4: This melon seed is very complicated to eat.\u2026\u2026Anonymous 37: New scoop! The two of them did it together. It is said that the Fu family and the Liang family apologized to the Lu family.Anonymous 38: Fuck!Anonymous 39: Dammn.\u2026\u2026Anonymous 77: So it\u2019s love madness? Love rivals joined forces in the darkroom? Exciting!!While Chu Yin was doing her homework at night, her phone\u2019s notification turned on.After opening it, she saw Song Zhaolin forwarded the post to her and asked her: [Sister, were you watching these two just as Brother Zhen asked you?]Chu Yin didn\u2019t like the forum, but she went in and looked.Seeing that it began to move towards the direction of imprisoning their beloved in a dark room, Chu Yin was speechless for a while.Thinking of the days when she was trapped next to Lu Zhen in her previous life, she couldn\u2019t help thinking\u2026this damn imprisonment!!Chu Yin turned off her phone and sighed.After finishing the system task, Chu Yin unlocked the script on the next page.Both the Liang family and Fu family apologized to Lu Zhen.Liang Yueqi was originally not involved, but Fu Mingxuan wasn\u2019t willing to bear the responsibility alone. Of course, she sold Liang Yueqi off. As a result, these two people were punished together.In the script, Lu Zhen said coldly, \u201cYou should apologize to the actual victim.\u201dBut no matter how they were asked, Fu Mingxuan and Liang Yueqi bit their mouths to death. They didn\u2019t reveal their original stupid plan. Therefore, Chu Yin wasn\u2019t involved in this matter from beginning to end.After finishing the script, Chu Yin found that it was the direction she hoped for, and there was nothing to modify.And because this paragraph was to solve this matter, Chu Yin also did not find a place in the script to start trouble with Lu Zhen.So she had a peaceful night\u2019s sleep.The next day when she went to school, Song Zhaolin looked at Chu Yin bitterly.\u201cSister Yin, you didn\u2019t reply to my WeChat.\u201d Song Zhaolin pouted.Chu Yin was completely accustomed to his behavior. She took out her notebook and workbook from her bag and replied, \u201cSorry, I forgot after reading the post.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cHave you read it?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat do you feel? Is there anything you want to add?\u201dChu Yin was almost convinced by him to spill the beans: \u201cNone!\u201dSong Zhaolin looked at her and suddenly realized a lady\u2019s feeling that \u2018her sister has a little secret on her back\u2019Chu Yin ignored his gaze. Her hands went to the table hole and found her pencil case.When she took out the pencil case, she accidentally brought out another thing\u2013the small pink tin box, which fell on the ground with a crisp \u201cclick\u201d.Song Zhaolin habitually helped her pick up her things. As soon as he fished it with his long arms, he intently looked at it and suddenly said, \u201cYou said you didn\u2019t have adultery!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Chu Yin lowered her eyes. It was the dog man who gave her the iPod.She originally thought about paying it back, but she forgot about it.Song Zhaolin held it up, lowered his voice, and asked incredulously, \u201cisn\u2019t this Brother Zhen\u2019s thing?\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows: \u201cYou know about this thing?\u201dAre you two in love??\u00a0Song Zhaolin said: \u201cI remember the color because it\u2019s too saucy, and I am familiar with the scratch on the side!\u201dChu Yin said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, please help me return it.\u201dSong Zhaolin said: \u201cIf Brother Zhen gave it to you, you can\u2019t return it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin thought of the Buddhist scriptures, \u201cNo, leave it to those who need it.\u201dAfter a while.Song Zhaolin secretly asked, \u201cIs there really no adultery?\u201d\u201cNo!! Ask again and you\u2019re dead.\u201dIn the evening, the iPod returned to Lu Zhen\u2019s hands.Lu Zhen played with the cold iron thing in his hand for a long time.Maybe Chu Yin didn\u2019t like Buddhist scriptures, or she just didn\u2019t want to own his things.Lu Zhen leaned on the head of the bed and stared at it for a while.Then he opened the playlist to see if she emptied the iPod he gave.But after opening it, he saw that the Buddhist scriptures were still on the list. Lu Zhen played one of them randomly then aimlessly flipped down.Then, Lu Zhen was dumbfounded. He found one more song at the bottom of the list.\u2026Chu Yin added it?The discovery made his heart burn slightly.It was a foreign song,\u00a0Schnappi Das Kleine Krokodil.It seems to be German, which had a kind of inexplicable intimacy. Lu Zhen\u2019s fingertips trembled as he clicked the song.The rhythm was unexpectedly cheerful.Surprisingly\u2026innocent?In the chorus part, the singing children kept repeating the word Schnappi, and the pronunciation sounds unfathomably\u00a0 familiar.Lu Zhen thought about it and called Song Zhaolin, who passed the iPod to him.\u201cWhat is schnappi?\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Song Zhaolin was confused.He researched it on the music software and said, \u201cI see. It\u2019s a song about a little crocodile!\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cWhat song?\u201dSong Zhaolin sang happily and innocently, \u201cthat\u2019s the one. It\u2019s very hot! The chorus part sings like, \u201cYou\u2019re the, you\u2019re the devil, the devil, the devil\u201dSong Zhaolin sang innocently and happily: \u201cThat\u2019s it. Ah, it\u2019s very popular! The chorus sang like, \u201cYou\u2019re the evil, evil, you\u2019re the devil the devil.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen hung up the phone.T/N: Sorry, I don\u2019t clearly understand Schnappi Das Kleine Krokodil. It\u2019s probably about a little crocodile snapping at everyone (to relate it to the story, it might be Chu Yin saying she\u2019s snapping at Lu Zhen at every chance she gets).\u00a01***This is the English lyrics:I am Schnappi the little crocodile.I come from Egypt, it lies right on the Nile.At first I lay in an egg,Then I schni- schna- snap myself free.Schni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi SchnappSchni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi SchnappI am Schnappi the little crocodile,I have sharp teeth and they are quiete pretty.I hog what I can snap,Yes I snap because I can do it so well.Schni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi SchnappSchni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi SchnappI am Schnappi the little crocodile,I like to snap, it\u2019s my favorite game.I creep onto my mommy,And show her how I can snap.Schni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi SchnappSchni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi SchnappI am Schnappi the little crocodile,And because I\u2019m snapping I don\u2019t get there very much.I briefly bite into my dad\u2019s leg,And then I easily shrink.Schni Schna SchnappiSchnappi Schnappi Schnapp (Snap)Schni Schna Schnappi (Yes)Schnappi Schnappi Schnapp (Snap)Schni Schna Schnappi (Mhmm)Schnappi Schnappi Schnapp (Yes)Schni Schna SchnappiSchnappi (Hmm) Schnappi SchnappPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

( 1)The campus sports event was still in full swing.The next day, after the fencing final, Lu Zhen won the championship easily.Chu Yin didn\u2019t go to the game, but Jiang Yan went. Although Jiang Yan studied very hard, she was not the kind of good student who didn\u2019t listen to things outside the window. She also liked to join in the fun. She had been paying attention to the forum incident this time and helped speak for Chu Yin since she had no account.\u00a01Jiang Yan knew how to study and play. Chu Yin really liked this little girl.After Jiang Yan came back from watching the game, she said to Chu Yin excitedly, \u201cHe\u2019s really handsome!\u201dChu Yin shook her head and sighed.You are all being cheated by that douchebag!!Lu Zhen made a good start. The whole school was enthusiastic about the sports event. People were excitedly talking about the candidates for each sport and every significant thing related to the games. Even when Chu Yin went to the teacher\u2019s office, the math teacher in Class 5 was chatting with the math teacher in the International Class.\u201cI heard that the young master of your class won the championship today?\u201d\u201cYes, I can\u2019t sit still even when the class isn\u2019t over. When the bell rang, I ran to watch the game!\u201dChu Yin silently opened her workbook. When she arrived at the desk, Teacher Wang clapped, her eyes were all praises, \u201cYou\u2019re really consistent. Other students have lost their hearts in studying because of this event, only you\u2019re the one who\u2019s still thinking of studying.\u201dChu Yin showed a standard good student smile. \u201cYes, teacher.\u201dTeacher Wang patted her arm and smiled, \u201cHowever, you should relax when it\u2019s time to relax! I don\u2019t know if your previous school was too strict, but we don\u2019t advocate for children to be excessively tight in studying. You should appropriately take part in more activities.\u201dChu Yin paused: \u201cYes, teacher.\u201d\u201cDo you know the school\u2019s apollo that\u2019s in International Class? What a handsome guy, you should go and watch his game!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dNo need! Excuse me!!I can not relax after watching it!!\u2026\u2026Chu Yin did want to participate in the event. Today was her billiards match.Although she didn\u2019t have any appeal for winning the prize, since she took part in it, she needed to do her best.Her game time collided with the Class 5 basketball game. Although the basketball game was ahead, Song Zhaolin said that he might not be able to catch up to watch her game.Chu Yin didn\u2019t care. She didn\u2019t need any audience to give her best effort for her class.Song Zhaolin looked sad. The first reason was that he couldn\u2019t watch his Sister Yin\u2019s game. The second reason was that the opponent in today\u2019s basketball game was the international class.Lin Lin is heartbroken, Lin Lin is heartbroken.\u201cWhen the game is over, I\u2019ll go and give you support,\u201d Song Zhaolin said, \u201cSister Yin, you have to fight to the end.\u201d\u201cI will try my best,\u201d Chu Yin finished, and gave Song Zhaolin a rare encouragement, \u201cThere is no enemy that can\u2019t be defeated. Lin Lin, believe in yourself, good luck!!\u201dSong Zhaolin almost cried: \u201c\u2014Sister Yin!\u201dHe even believed that he could defeat Brother Zhen! What kind of trust this is!Mom, he\u2019s so touched!During the day, the learning atmosphere in the class was obviously not very strong. Everyone was waiting excitedly for today\u2019s basketball game.Fu Mingxuan was a little uncomfortable. It happened that the time of the billiards game collided with the basketball game. She also wanted to see Lu Zhen play basketball! For a moment, she almost wanted to give up the billiards game, which she had signed up for.But when she thought that Chu Yin had also signed up, she felt that she had to go. Chu Yin had provoked her!Yesterday\u2019s incident was settled down at home. Since the Liang family was bigger, the Lu family didn\u2019t reprimand them too much for the sake of harmony. Except for her and Liang Yueqi, no one knew of their original plan.Hmpf\u2026 Chu Yin didn\u2019t know what she had escaped by chance.But in today\u2019s billiards game, she could slap her in the face.She was a nerd who came from the countryside. Fu Mingxuan guessed that she had never touched a pool table before. Fu Mingxuan\u2019s uncle liked to play billiards. They had a top-level billiard table in their house. Her uncle would teach her a few strokes when he was free. This was more than enough to deal with people like Chu Yin.The classroom was already empty in the afternoon. Everyone ran to watch the basketball game.Fu Mingxuan stood up, glanced back at Chu Yin before proudly leaving the classroom. She planned to go to the basketball match first, cheer for Lu Zhen, then go back to the billiard\u2019s pool hall.Chu Yin sat in the classroom to finish the task steadily and then left for the venue where the competition was held.\u201cDing \u2013 Completed the history exercises \u221a\u00a0 You received a [change word] permission~ Host, keep on working hard~\u201d\u201cKeep it first.\u201dBecause of the basketball game currently happening, there were only a few people in the billiards field. The people inside were only the contestants who signed up for the game. There were about ten people in total who were divided into eight groups for group competitions. People in the same group would battle in three rounds then the top three places would be determined.When Chu Yin walked into the stadium, many people looked over.\u201cThis is Chu Yin from 2nd year, Class 5.\u201d\u201cWhy did she come to the billiards game?\u201dFu Mingxuan arrived long ago and chatted with a few people in the court. Seeing her walking in wearing a loose school uniform, she sneered and said a few words to the people next to her, and then their gazes at Chu Yin became somewhat mocking.Some people present really liked billiards, so they had no good impression of people who treat it as a joke. Although Chu Yin was beautiful and good at learning, she didn\u2019t look like she could play billiards. It was obvious that she was just treating this sport as a joke.After drawing a group, Fu Mingxuan wasn\u2019t happy that she couldn\u2019t get into a group with Chu Yin. She went to Chu Yin and said, \u201cGood luck, Chu Yin! Fight to score a goal.\u201dChu Yin thought of her dejected appearance yesterday, and then compared with her appearance now, she sighed in her heart.Cannon fodder, always hopping.Fu Mingxuan left triumphantly.Chu Yin followed her opponent to the pool table. The girl was very happy that she randomly received an easy opponent. Her tone was polite: \u201cThen let\u2019s start?\u201dChu Yin moved her shoulder and neck a little, and a little light lit up in her eyes: \u201cGood luck.\u201d\u2026\u2026Half an hour later, Fu Mingxuan walked to the results announcement area triumphantly.She just defeated her opponent. She would at least be in third place!Fu Mingxuan looked back and found that Chu Yin had just finished her match.Just when she wanted to ask Chu Yin if she scored a goal, the referee came with the results and announced the top four players\u2013among them was Chu Yin\u2019s name!Fu Mingxuan\u2019s expression was incredulous.Was Chu Yin\u2019s opponent easy? Was she this lucky??In this round of drawing, she and Chu Yin got into the same group.When Fu Mingxuan was about to say something to Chu Yin, there was a commotion outside the billiard hall, then a large group of people poured in.As soon as Song Zhaolin came in, he called out to Chu Yin. Seeing her, he trotted over: \u201cIs the match over??\u201dChu Yin: \u201cNo, it will be in the second round \u2013 how about you?\u201dSong Zhaolin said, \u201cWe humbly lost.\u201dBrother Zhen seemed very upset today. He had a cold face throughout the game. His style of playing was particularly ruthless. Zhao Yuxiong in Class 5 couldn\u2019t even handle them. The players in Class 5 were so afraid that they lost a dozen points against the International Class.\u201cBut it\u2019s a glorious defeat for us! Oh, don\u2019t worry about us. Let me see who your opponent is \u2014 same class? Then either of you can win\u2013 no, you should win. Sister Yin, I\u2019ll be rooting for you!\u201dChu Yin was nagged to death by him, so Jiang Yan came and pulled Song Zhaolin away.Several people went in at the other side of the door. Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze rushed over while Lu Zhen lazily came with a coat in his hand.Fu Mingxuan\u2019s sharp eyes immediately spotted him. Determined to have a good performance, she would definitely humiliate her opponents in front of Lu Zhen.There were more and more people. Finally, the billiard hall was packed with people. They looked at the two tables in the court.Since Chu Yin\u2019s school uniform was too loose, it was prone to accidentally sweep the ball on the table. So this time, she pulled down the zipper, took off her school uniform jacket, and tied it to her waist.The eyes of the audience fell on her.Chapter 25 \u2013 What a powerful man!! ( 2)Taking off the old school uniform jacket, she only had a black thin shirt that outlined her beautiful curve. Chu Yin neatly pinned her hair into a high ponytail, revealing a long and swan-like neck.She picked up the cue and placed a chalk powder. Then she raised her chin at Fu Mingxuan, \u201cGood luck.\u201dGu Qiuze, who was not far away, looked at this scene and suddenly smiled, \u201cI thought your sister was participating for fun. Looking at her gestures\u2026it doesn\u2019t look like it.\u201dChu Yin held the stick with her left diagonally while the powder block in her right hand. The action of playing the powder was rhythmic. Her left hand turned the stick, ensuring that it hits the center of the ball. She looked like she was used to this.Chu Shi was a little surprised. He didn\u2019t know Chu Yin could play billiards.No one knew that Chu Yin\u2019s hobby in her previous life was billiards. Among the things that Lu Zhen taught her, this was what Chu Yin was best at. She even later played better than Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen was interested in her preferences. After finding out that she liked billiards, he installed a pool table made of rare mahogany that was hand-carved. Chu Yin didn\u2019t think it was necessary at the beginning but later discovered that she could beat the dog man in other games.Chu Yin shook her head and immersed herself in the game in front of her. The billiard cue provided by the school was not as good as the one she used before. But fortunately, Huiwen had money and the billiard cue in her hand was passable.The game finally officially began.She spread her slender fingers, put them on the cue, folded her thumb, and clasped the cue with her index finger. She made a standard hand frame. Even Lu Zhen, who was sitting in the corner, raised his eyebrows.Chu Yin leaned down and lowered her upper body on the table. Her body was extremely lowered, showing her slender legs and her curvy waist. Her clothes tightly clung to her body, making the people in the audience blush. They held their breath subconsciously.She aimed at the first ball in the ball pile. It went down in one shot before it violently bumped with other balls.With a \u201cda\u201d, the pile of balls was scattered beautifully.There were several suppressed breaths.\u201cShit, she\u2019s so weak.\u201d\u201cWhy did I become excited by seeing her bump the balls?\u201d\u201cTo tell you the truth, I am also\u2026\u201dIn the corner, Lu Zhen retracted his gaze, frowned, and leaned back.Fu Mingxuan was a little nervous at this time. She stared at Chu Yin\u2019s hand closely. After two consecutive shorts, Chu Yin wasn\u2019t able to control her force and it hit lightly.Spectator Song Zhaolin was nervous: \u201cAh, ah, it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over!\u201dJiang Yan was so angry that she gave him a hard slap: \u201cYou shut up!\u201dFu Mingxuan was also relieved. Although Chu Yin could play better than she thought, her level was not higher than hers.When it was Fu Mingxuan\u2019s turn, she scored two goals before it was Chu Yin\u2019s turn. After Chu Yin scored another goal, it was Fu Minxuan\u2019s turn again before changing to Chu Yin after she scored another goal.Overall, Fu Mingxuan seemed to have the upper hand. Although communication wasn\u2019t allowed in the middle of the match, Fu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t help but disturb her, \u201cOh, what should I do? I\u2019m so weak. My level is really poor.\u201dChu Yin held the cue stick, looked down at the table, and nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dFu Mingxuan: \u201c\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin stared at the billiards table nervously and murmured, \u201cCan she do it? Why do I feel that they are at the same level? Can Sister Yin win or not?\u201dJiang Yan was speechless next to him. She wished she could cover Song Zhaolin\u2019s mouth with a tape. In truth, she had no confidence in herself. She also hoped that Chu Yin would but, but Fu Mingxuan seemed to be very good at it too.At the same moment, Lu Zhen in the corner looked at the table and laughed in a low voice.Smart.Chu Yin hit the ball using the cue stick. Her peach blossom eyes were filled with excitement.She had made the necessary preparations.Now, she\u2019s going to start.Fu Minxuan didn\u2019t realize what was going to happen at first.But over the next five minutes, she gradually learned what it meant to collapse.She never had the chance to make a move.Chu Yin scored five in a row. Her action was clear and accurate. The way she walked around the stage was casual and elegant.The position of the black ball was very tricky. Everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on it.Fu Mingxuan was desperate and prayed that she would miss.Chu Yin casually looked then stood for ten seconds before slamming the cue stick.\u2014\u2014The black ball rebounded and spun until it fell directly into the pocket!At this point, Chu Yin cleared the stage with one stroke, leaving no chance for her opponent.The audience roared.\u201cDamn!\u201d\u201cMy god, what kind of fairy is she?\u201d\u201cI love, I love, I love~\u201dGu Qiuze clapped, \u201cThat hit just now was amazing.\u201dSong Zhaolin held Jiang Yan excitedly. The two of them cried together shamelessly, \u201cChu Yin, ah ah!!\u201dIn the second game, the two group winners face off. Chu Yin completely found the feeling and easily won the game cleanly.There had been countless people on the scene that became her fans.Song Zhaolin, the number one fan brother, and Jiang Yan, the number one fan sister, ran to celebrate for her.\u201cChampion ah!!!\u201d\u201cToo strong!\u201dChu Yin was shaken by Jiang Yan, and her lips couldn\u2019t help smiling.The feeling of youth and victory was good. It\u2019s fresh and enthusiastic.Lu Zhen looked at her from beginning to end. Watching her calmly take the shot, watching her joyful face, his heart was filled with an indescribable feeling.She should be like this, excellent and beautiful, calm but blooming.It was obvious that there would be many people attracted to her.Will she belong to anyone\u2026Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze walked to Chu Yin. They vigorously praised her again and again.Gu Qiuze blinked: \u201cWhen will you fight me? My skills are good.\u201dChu Yin laughed and said, \u201cOkay, whenever.\u201dFrom a distance, Lu Zhen darkly stared at her smiling face. After a while, he got up and left the stadium with a cold look.Chu Shi: \u201cNow, your brother is up next.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cAre you going to play basketball?\u201dGu Qiuze laughed: \u201cThird-year seniors only have this activity. How can we let it go?\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cWho are you competing with? I\u2019ll go and cheer you on.\u201dChu Shi rubbed his hands and said with a smile: \u201cI think we\u2019re up against the second-year International Class.\u201dChu Yin almost burst out with a \u201cpoof\u201d.Basketball was a school-wide competition. The winning class among the grade would compete with other classes in different grades. In the second year grade, both Class 5 and the International Class were the strongest. But since Class 5 lost against the International Class, the International Class was promoted to compete against other grade levels.Therefore, it\u2019s a high probability that the second-year International Class would compete against the third year.Chu Yin: Can I not go\u2026Dog man plays basketball well. She didn\u2019t want to watch him gloriously play.Chu Shi patted his sister on the shoulder, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother will show you how to win the champion.\u201dChu Yin tried to believe, but doubts were revealed in her eyes.\u201cReally!\u201d Chu Shi said, \u201cMe and Brother Qiuze are invincible. We were number one last year.\u201dThis was true. Gu Qiuze nodded with approval.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help being a little elated.\u00a0Brother\u2026can they really beat Lu Zhen?\u201cAnd Lu Zhen, in the second-year International Class.\u201d Chu Shi waved, \u201cHe\u2026It\u2019s okay. I\u2019m not afraid.\u201dGu Quize: ??You\u2019re pretending too much.But Chu Yin was quite cooperative: \u201cMm-hmm, I think so too!\u201dChu Shi suddenly floated in his own dreams: \u201cHe playing has a lot of loopholes, in fact, not very good.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cSo it is! No wonder he doesn\u2019t look so good.\u201dChu Shi: \u201cSo Yin Yin, come to the game and watch how we beat him.\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe basketball game lasted for two days, and the final winner was the second and third international classes.A century war was about to start.Chu Yin won the championship in billiards and accumulated five points in the class, and then she completely stopped paying attention to the sport\u2019s event and was obsessed with studying.Chapter 25 \u2013 What a powerful man!! ( 3)It wasn\u2019t until the day of the basketball finals that she was reminded to watch her brother\u2019s game after class.The people in the class quickly ran and Jiang Yan said that she would go to take a place for her, so she went first.Chu Yin finished her notes in no hurry, then took her water bottle to get some water.After turning a corner, she met Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen held her arms, looked at her as if she wanted to run. The corner of his mouth was raised: \u201cGood student.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Zhen stepped closer, looked down at her, and smiled: \u201cThe iPod song, were you scolding me?\u201dChu Yin shrunk her neck slightly.\u2026.I almost forgot about it.The dog man saw it, then he listened to it.Yeah!! Scold you!!What\u2019s wrong with it?But on the surface, Chu Yin was confused and asked, \u201cWhat song?\u201dLu Zhen looked down at her carefully.Sometimes he wanted to knock on her little head to see what\u2019s inside. Why is she good at studying? Why is her billiards skill so good? Why is everything so\u2026attractive.Lu Zhen shook his head: \u201cNothing.\u201dEven if she scolded him, he would be happy.He\u2019s probably a fool.\u201cChu Yin,\u201d he looked at her, \u201cDo you like those who study well?\u201dJust like Gu Qiuze, who studies well. She would be gentle as she smiled at him.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t keep up with his jumping thoughts and let out a suspicious \u201cah\u201dLu Zhen couldn\u2019t help but curl his lips.So dumb. So cute.\u201cThen you come to watch the game,\u201d said Lu Zhen. \u201cRight now at the basketball court.\u201dWatch how I defeat him (Gu Qiuze).Look at me. I\u2019m better than him.Chu Yin knocked on the system with a confused face.\u201cDo you think the dog man is weird?\u201dXueji: \u201cThe host needs to judge for herself.\u201dChu Yin slowly walked towards the basketball court while pondering.To be honest, 17-year-old Lu Zhen is completely different from the future.And because of the years that followed, Chu Yin was a little vague about what Lu Zhen looked like when he was 17\u00a01. But from the perspective of her memory, Lu Zhen\u2019s appearance in this life was very different, which made Chu Yin very unsure.But anyway, the dog man is still a dog man.While thinking about it, she arrived at the basketball court.Some students took the initiative to greet Chu Yin, and she responded each of them. When she found the seat Jiang Yan reserved, she walked over. Her elder brother knew that Jiang Yan was her friend, so he sat near her seat, closest to the court.Chu Yin suddenly saw Zheng Yu.\u2026.She forgot that this self-proclaimed confident man was also in her brother\u2019s class.Chu Shi saw her hesitation, touched her head, and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother has warned him. He won\u2019t look for you again.\u201dChu Yin breathed a sigh of relief.Both Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze who wore their jerseys were quite handsome. Many girls in the audience looked at Chu Yin and Jiang Yan with jealousy.They also want to be close to the seniors too!This scene was in front of the second year International Class. Chu Qiuqiu was sitting in the stadium stands when she saw Chu Shi touching Chu Yin\u2019s head.Someone asked: \u201cChu Yin, why does your brother love your sister so much?\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face turned pale, but she smiled and said, \u201cYes. My brother wanted me to go there but I wanted to cheer for our class, so I refused.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s it.\u201dSoon, Lu Zhen came on the court.He wore a black and white jersey, exposing his arm wrapped in black arm guard. The black and white headband on his hair exposed his white forehead. His brown-red tear mole under his eye was extremely clear.He glanced at the opponent\u2019s area and smiled.The girls crazily cheered.Their phone snapped a hundred photos even before the game had started. There were numerous threads and posts in the forum simultaneously. It\u2019s as if they were recording the history of World War II.Chu Shi distressingly looked at Lu Zhen\u2019s appearance and turned his head discontentedly. But seeing that his younger sister was unmoved, he felt at ease.\u201cWait and see how we clean up these children.\u201dChu Yin clenched her fist: \u201cBrother, I believe you.\u201dGu Qiuze came over and informed, \u201cIt\u2019s time we go to the court.\u201dZheng Yu followed him to the court. Turning his head, he showed a complex look with both traces of melancholy and affection at Chu Yin.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen saw this scene from a distance, and his eyebrows folded.Soon, when the referee whistled, the game officially began.Although Zheng Yu was a lewd person, his height was good. Lu Zhen\u2019s height was 186cm this year. Zheng Yu looked a little stronger than him, plus Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze were both very tall. The third-year team was like a wall of people.The second-years on the opposite side looked much weaker. Lu Zhen was the tallest, followed by Tan Ke, and the following team members were decreasing in height.Chu Yin sincerely looked forward to seeing Lu Zhen being defeated.But.When she watched Lu Zhen play Zheng Yu like a little kid\u2013He dribbled the ball around him and made a smash dunk. All the girls howled to death.She knew.She was naive.\u201cAh ahhhhhh Brother Zhen!\u201d\u201cSo handsome.\u201d\u201cMiddle charge!!!\u201d\u201cThe second year of senior high school is sure to win!\u201dLu Zhen passed them while dribbling the ball. He shot in one go since no one dared to block him.His exuberant hormones radiated vigorously. This young man who played basketball under the rays of the sun looked incomparably dazzling.At halftime, the second-years were leading by more than ten points. Chu Shi couldn\u2019t complain anymore. Even when the third-years tried many tactics, they couldn\u2019t help but watch their team crumble.\u201cIs Lu Zhen crazy?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no use fighting so hard?\u201d\u201cHas anyone of you angered him?\u201dSeveral people were silent for a moment.Then they looked at Zheng Yu.\u201cMaybe it was when you slammed Lu Zhen on the wall\u2026\u201dZheng Yu was drinking water and almost choked to death: \u201cI didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t mean to! \u201c\u201cOkay,\u201d Gu Qiuze clapped his hands, \u201ccalm down.\u201dJust now when Lu Zhen stole the ball from him, he saw him smile. It was so provocative that he knew this was intentional.This kid may just want to abuse him.\u201cLet\u2019s hold our ground. There\u2019s still a chance in the second half.\u201d The players stabilized their military spirit.Lu Zhen\u2019s stamina seemed endless. He only left the court once in the middle time and then played from beginning to end. No one could defeat him.Chu Yin had lost hope and became a salted fish.\u2026She obviously came to see Lu Zhen being defeated. How could this be the case?She was forced to watch Lu Zhen\u2019s handsome scenes for forty minutes!The point was that he was so handsome that it angered her to death!!!The more charismatic dog man is, the angrier she becomes.There was only one minute left in the game.Lu Zhen took the ball outside the three-point line and suddenly looked outside the court.He raised his chin to showcase his beautiful jawline. The smile on his lips gleamed with sweat as he gently raised his hand towards the audience.It was just a one-second action, but the girls on the stands burst out in high screams.Chu Yin was surprised.She knocked the system wildly, \u201cDid the dogman look at me just now?!\u201dXueji: \u201cit seems to be\u2026\u201dChu Yin: \u201cHe\u2019s actually teasing me? Teasing me!\u201dShe immediately decided to open the script.\u3010Lu Zhen raised his hand and made a standard throwing action. The three-point ball crossed a beautiful arc in the air and went in!\u3011Chu Yin sneered and crossed out [ went in ] 2\u00a0and changed it to the word [ exploded ]You play so handsomely, go and destroy it, you scum!!In the court, Lu Zhen raised his hand, lifted his arm, and threw the basketball accurately.Thousands of pairs of eyes followed the ball and watched it about to enter the basket, but then\u2014\u201cBang\u201d There was a loud noise.Suddenly, it exploded into fireworks.The audience was silent.Lu Zhen was also shocked.In the 50 years since Huiwen school was founded, the first man with a strange power appeared with the ability to blow up a basketball.Chu Yin finally applauded.\u201cWow!\u201d\u201cWhat a powerful man!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Everyone in the stadium wasn\u2019t expecting it. Their faces showed genuine awe.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dStrange things kept on happening.\u201cBeep\u2013\u201cAt this time, the whistle blew signaling that the game just ended.People finally came to their senses.Although the explosion ruined the beautiful three-pointer, second-year International Class still won the game! They won against the strongest team of third-years! The students of the second-years immediately cheered.Chu Yin\u2019s voice was not loud and there were no other people around her, so only Jiang Yan heard her praises.She recovered from the explosion shock, clapped, and turned her head to Chu Yin, \u201cWh, What powerful man?\u201dChu Yin smiled profoundly, \u201cHow powerful is he to blow up the ball.\u201dJiang Yan: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhy do I feel like you don\u2019t mean that??If she remembered correctly, during the entire game just now, when the girls were crying and roaring to death, Chu Yin didn\u2019t say a word, as if she was completely unexcited, only when the basketball exploded did it caught her attention.Jiang Yan couldn\u2019t help feeling ashamed: She was still too unstable. Just now she couldn\u2019t help but cheer loudly. It seemed that there was still a long way to go between herself and Yin Yin.Chu Yin felt comfortable.She said to Xueji: \u201cYou saw how that dog man looked at me. If he plays handsome again, I\u2019ll knock his head off.\u201dXueji was completely accustomed to her series of evil operations. It even thought that this finishing stroke had quite a dramatic effect.\u201cHost, you\u2019re amazing.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dLu Zhen overturned Chu Shi. Before the game started, Chu Shi felt proud of himself. He was too arrogant in front of his sister and didn\u2019t hold back with his bragging. This was too embarrassing.Chu Shi wiped his sweat and looked at Gu Qiuze bitterly.Gu Qiuze was also tortured by Lu Zhen. He patted Chu Shi on the shoulder and scolded him, \u201cNext time, don\u2019t take me with you.\u201dHow shameless in front of his sister.The opposite area was celebrating crazily, while the third-year seniors were calmer. Chu Shi hesitantly walked to Chu Yin and said, \u201cBrother is not in a good condition today and didn\u2019t play well.\u201dJiang Yan witnessed Chu Yin\u2019s praise of Lu Zhen just now. Although her tone was a bit strange, she probably cheered for the second-year team more. Who knew that when Chu Yin opened her mouth, said, \u201cNo, brother. I think you are much more handsome than the other person!\u201dChu Shi was also surprised: \u201cReally, really?\u201dChu Yin said sincerely, \u201cYes, The man on the other side was playing too wild, not handsome at all, but your dribbling is like art.\u201dJiang Yan: \u201c!!\u201dThis is too exaggerated!Sure enough, Chu Shi, once again floated in his daydreams, \u201cIn fact, I also think he is average. Someday, if my physical condition is better, I can win it back.\u201d\u201cBrother, you are modest.\u201d Chu Yin shook her head, \u201cI believe you can defeat him anytime if you\u2019re in good shape.\u201dChu Shi immediately felt he was standing from the sky just like an emperor with an incredible aura. It\u2019s as if he could rub that bastard Lu Zhen to the ground in the next second.Gu Qiuze looked at him: \u201c\u2026\u201d Wake up.Jiang Yan also looked at them and thought: Yin Yin and Chu Shi have a good relationship!On the opposite side of the area, the players of the second-years International Class were surrounded by a large crowd.Lu Zhen avoided the crowd, stood on the stand, and glanced across the opposite side.Chu Yin sat surrounded by a group of tall seniors. Her figure was completely submerged and couldn\u2019t be seen.Lu Zhen watered his mouth and lifted his hand to wipe away traces of water. Annoyed.Song Zhaolin squeezed towards him through the crowd. He automatically entered his boasting mode, \u201cBrother Zhen, MVP! So handsome! My throat is hoarse from screaming for you!\u201dLu Zhen glanced at him and thought. He asked: \u201cWhere were you sitting just now?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cJust behind your area!\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes: \u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dThen he didn\u2019t know her reaction.\u201cBut Brother Zhen, you can actually blow up the ball, so fierce~!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen was silent for a moment, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean to.\u201dHe was sure that the ball was still normal when he threw it. Something went wrong just as soon as it was about to go into the basket.Over the past few months, there seemed to be more and more unthinkable things. They all had something in common that he couldn\u2019t find just yet.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t think so much about it. He just thought that his brother was too awesome! He was over his head, \u201cNo matter what, you made history!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen gave him a kick: \u201cGet out.\u201d***The final champion of the basketball game was the second-year International Class. They originally had five points but now six points were added from winning the championship. At present, the total points completely eliminated Class 5.Song Zhaolin\u2019s mentality was particularly good. After knowing that Class 5 couldn\u2019t catch up, no matter how much he wanted to be in the first place, he wasn\u2019t burdened with the results at all. Every day, he wandered around various venues, watching this and that, just like chasing stars.While Chu Yin was studying, she felt envious when she saw Song Zhaolin\u2019s carefree appearance.How nice to be a simple-minded person! At least he\u2019s happy all the time!She stood up and went out to the toilet. Song Zhaolin, who was playing with his mobile phone, quickly and respectfully made way for the queen.A lot of people in the class went to watch the billiards game last time.\u00a0 Because Class 5 was just defeated right before, they didn\u2019t feel good returning to the classroom, so they went to billiards hall. They were just in time to see two flowers battling against each other.Originally, they were betting for Mingxuan to win. After all, they knew that Chu Yin only knew studying.After the match, all of them turned against each other.Whenever the ball fell to the pocket, the boys still couldn\u2019t recover from their shock. Chu Yin finished it so fast!!From then on, although they didn\u2019t explicitly say it, they regarded Chu Yin as a little queen in their hearts.Of course, Song Zhaolin was the best at licking people\u2019s shoes. As soon as Chu Yin was about to take her water cup, Song Zhaolin immediately found the cup and delivered it to Chu Yin with both of his hands.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help laughing: \u201cThank you, Xiao Linzi.\u201dThe boys around who secretly watched were full of envy.Chu Yin took the cup and looked around from side to side, but found no enemy, so she continued to move forward. Unexpectedly, when she turned a corner, she met another acquaintance.But this time, it was not Lu Zhen, but Zheng Yu. Well, nothing good.Although Zheng Yu and the others lost to the second year of high school, they were runners-up at any rate. He scored second on the team. Even if those goals were almost negligible under Lu Zhen\u2019s glory, he also performed very well. At the end of the game, many little girls came to give him water.So he completely walked out of his psychological shadow of being kicked by Lu Zhen and accidentally kneeling in front of Chu Yin.Chu Yin looked at his regained confidence and felt that this was good. She didn\u2019t want to give people PTSD.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZheng Yu looked at her deeply: \u201cYin, how did you feel when you watched the basketball match that day?\u201dChu Yin had goosebumps and almost turned to leave. But she breathed hard and held back, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel much.\u201dZheng Yu looked at her and was about to lift his hand. It seemed like he wanted to come nearer. But the next second, he consciously retracted his hand back.Chu Yin: \u2026Very good. At Least he still had a bit of psychological shadow left.\u201cIs it really impossible between us?\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cYes, it\u2019s impossible. You can find someone else.\u201dWith that, she walked away.Zheng Yu stood in the same place all by himself.He came this time because he heard some news from his parents: The Chu family intends to marry their daughters to powerful families to merge their family\u2019s business.Although Chu Qiuqiu was also good, Chu Yin was obviously more beautiful. Zheng Yu felt that if Chu Yin wanted to marry someone else in the future, why couldn\u2019t she marry him? He felt that it would be difficult for Chu Yin to find a better one than him.Zheng Yu was aggrieved. Suddenly, a soft voice came from behind: \u201cSenior?\u201dHe turned his head and saw Chu Qiuqiu standing behind him, looking at him like a deer with a pair of eyes: \u201cDid sister make you angry?\u201dZheng Yu\u2019s frustrations in Chu Yin were immediately satisfied by Chu Qiuqiu. He showed a chic smile: \u201cIt was nothing, don\u2019t worry.\u201dChu Qiuqiu smiled, \u201cIf you\u2019re unhappy, senior, can I walk with you? Consider it as my sister\u2019s apology.\u201dZheng Yu, a straight man, had always liked being treated like this. He immediately thought to himself, Chu Qiuqiu treated him with this attitude, what could Chu Yin do? She came from the countryside, how could she be compared to Chu Qiuqiu? Chu Yin would regret not picking him in the future.And when he looked closely, Chu Qiuqiu looked two-thirds like Chu Yin. She was also very pretty.Zheng Yu raised a smile: \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go for a walk.\u201dIn the evening in Chu\u2019s residence.At the dining table, the Chu parents were beaming with joy. Looking at the two daughters, one was gentle and well-behaved, the other was bright and beautiful. They were good at their academics that they felt so proud.Father Chu said, \u201cQiuqiu, Xiaoyin, you\u2019re all grown-ups now. I didn\u2019t notice it for a while, but you grew up so beautifully. \u201cChu Qiuqiu obediently said something to Father Chu.Chu Yin was silent, thinking that this \u201cperiod\u201d was long enough.It\u2019s been more than ten years.Chu Qiuqiu glanced at her unmoved look and was secretly happy. A character like Chu Yin was not suitable for marriage at all. She was afraid that Chu Yin would just embarrass herself.Chapter 26 \u2013 So exciting!!(2)She had overheard the conversation between the servants and learned that her parents were planning to marry them to powerful families. Chu Qiuqiu remembered how dilapidated and poor her family\u2019s condition was before the age of 7, so her goal had always been to perform excellently to maintain her position in a wealthy family.Marriage is a good way to merge the families\u2019 wealth. This way, she could still enjoy the glory and richness of a powerful family.Chu Qiuqiu was more practical than Fu Mingxuan. She knew she couldn\u2019t reach an elite family like Lu Zhen. She would consider herself as a winner in life if she could marry into a family that was wealthier than the Chu\u2019s. Chu Yin didn\u2019t know about these and didn\u2019t even know the opportunities she missed.Father Chu looked at Chu Yin\u2019s expressionless face while eating and he felt unhappy.Their own biological daughter had been in the house for several months yet there were no signs of maturity at all. If you don\u2019t ask her, she wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to speak. She had never kissed her mother and never went out of her room.How could this kind of character be qualified to participate in social occasions in the future? In the end, she became like this because she wasn\u2019t raised at home.Mother Chu tried to stir up the topic with Chu Yin, \u201cIs Yin Yin very good at billiards? If so, that\u2019s good..\u201dChu Yin wiped her mouth: \u201cWell, a little bit.\u201dThen the atmosphere went cold again.She wasn\u2019t doing this deliberately. She was just too disappointed in her previous life that she had nothing to say to them in this life.Moreover, from the tone of her parent\u2019s voices, combined with the memory of the last life, Chu Yin understood the subtext of it.They might have been thinking about marriage again.Before, when the Chu family looked for marriage partners for them, Chu Yin was still underage and didn\u2019t know about the operation of these events. In contrast, Chu Qiuqiu was obviously very happy.Chu Yin had no interest in this marriage in her previous life, and Lu Zhen, that dog man, wouldn\u2019t allow her to consider it.The Chu family would eventually go bankrupt and the marriage would not last long.Looking at Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s positive attitude, she felt quite pitiful.Seeing Mother Chu\u2019s face turned red with embarrassment, Father Chu went cold, \u201cYour mother wants to know more about you. You\u2019re her child. Why do you talk so little?\u201dChu Yin just finished eating and placed down her spoon, \u201cI don\u2019t. It just depends on my mood.\u201dFather Chu became angrier. What does this mean? Are you not in the mood to talk to your parents?!Chu Shi looked up at his father, frowned, then patted Chu Yin\u2019s arm, and said in a warm voice, \u201cGo back to your room.\u201dChu Yin nodded, turned, and left.Father Chu: \u201cYou!\u2014\u2014\u201dChu Qiuqiu looked at her father\u2019s face and felt happy. She quickly comforted him and said, \u201cDad, don\u2019t be angry. You know that sister has a temperament.\u201dFather Chu sighed: \u201cQiuqiu is still sensible.\u201dEven if his biological daughter\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t good, he still needed to consider her when planning for a suitable marriage partner.\u201cI will take you to some banquets so you\u2019ll get to know more people.\u201d Father Chu said, \u201cQiuqiu wouldn\u2019t make us worry, right?\u201dChu Qiuqiu knew the purpose and significance of the banquet and immediately raised a smile.\u201cOf course not. Don\u2019t worry, mom and dad!\u201dThe sport\u2019s event lasted for several weeks before it finally came to an end.Second-year, Class 5 placed second in total. The champions in the class were Song Zhaolin, Zhao Yuxiong, and Chu Yin. The prize for placing second was 50,000 yuan. The class monitor announced that this prize would be used in the future for the class.Second-year, International Class ranked first in total, in which Lu Zhen scored 21 points, higher than the total score of other classes.Song Zhaolin talked about Lu Zhen\u2019s great achievements around Chu Yin, whilst Chu Yin replied in a low voice, \u201cHmm\u2026like an animal.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cAh? What are you talking about?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cI said, he\u2019s so fierce.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cHahaha, right, Brother Zhen is really fierce!\u201dChu Yin looked at his silly white and sweet appearance, and reminded him with a smile, \u201cLin Lin, have a snack first. Don\u2019t forget it will be the final exam soon.\u201dThe Song family actually had high requirements for their children. Song Zhaolin had an excellent elder brother. After the last midterm exam, his elder brother cleaned him up clearly after seeing the colorful transcript1.After returning alive from his brother\u2019s punishment, Song Zhaolin studied honestly for a few days. But as soon as the sport\u2019s event took place, his heart flew together with excitement.Song Zhaolin was startled after being reminded by Chu Yin. He looked at his phone\u2019s calendar and reassured himself.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. There\u2019s still time.\u201d Song Zhaolin said. \u201cMoreover, there\u2019s still an event before the final exam!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhat event?\u201d\u201cChristmas!\u201d Song Zhaolin said, \u201cChristmas Eve is so romantic! There\u2019s a gift-drawing activity that is hosted annually!\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyebrows were raised slightly. She was a little impressed.There were many big activities in Huiwen. Both Chinese and foreign festivals were celebrated. In the Christmas event, a huge Christmas tree is placed in the hall of the school building. Each person would place their gifts under the tree before they would draw the lot together.In addition to putting the gifts inside the box, it also had its own name and blessings. The person who received the other person\u2019s gift was usually regarded as some kind of fate.The reason why Chu Yin remembered it was that she exchanged gifts with Lu Zhen.Her gift of biscuits in a small jar was exchanged with an 800,000 yuan watch.She was so surprised when she opened the box that she almost dropped the watch. At that time, Chu Yin thought that Lu Zhen was mentally sick. He didn\u2019t want to get the watch backSong Zhaolin grossly winked: \u201cSister Yin, you have to be prepared. With our special fate, maybe we will draw each other~~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d***Worrying about Song Zhaolin\u2019s father\u2019s mentality, Chu Yin urged Song Zhaolin to study a little.Huiwen\u2019s sports event was indeed well-organized. It made the students discuss it for a while everyday, and forget any intention of studyingOn this day, the teachers held a meeting. They decided to let the top three students of the grade discuss their own learning experiences. They believed this would revitalize the academic atmosphere in the school.Fu Mingxuan was angry at the news. She placed fourth in the grade, one short!If Chu Yin didn\u2019t join in, she would have been the one talking to the class!Chu Yin glanced at Fu Mingxuan, who was full of displeasure. She took the initiative to talk to her, which was rare, \u201cHow about you go in my stead?\u201dFu Mingxuan\u2019s eyes widened: \u201cAre you provoking me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin said, \u201cForget it.\u201dShe really didn\u2019t want to go. She had to go to the International Class for this lecture.Chu Yin was thinking of a reason to avoid going to the International Class when the headteacher rushed and pressed her shoulder, \u201cLet\u2019s go. The teacher of Class 1 already made the students sit down. They are waiting for you!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin was silent for two seconds, \u201cOkay, teacher.\u201dThe second and third students were from other classes, a boy and a girl. They didn\u2019t talk with each other that much and only went to Class 1 directly.The girl, who placed third, was quietly looking at Chu Yin. When Chu Yin caught her looking, she quickly retracted her sight, her face turning a little red.How can someone be so intelligent and beautiful at the same time?Looking up close is even better than looking far away!When they entered the classroom of Class 1, the students had already sat down. As soon as they appeared, they immediately burst into applause.They mostly stared at Chu Yin. Their reactions were the same as the girl, who placed third.\u201cGod, I think I can listen to her chanting Sutras in front of me\u2026\u201d\u201cMe too. She can beat me like a wooden fish!\u201dChu Yin was calm. After discussing her study schedule and study habits, she stepped aside and gave the stage to the second and third place.\u2026Although there was still time left before the class would end, Lu Zhen got up directly from his chair while looking at his phone.Tan Ke glanced and saw him leaving, \u201cIs something wrong, Brother Zhen?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dWhen Lu Zhen just walked out of the classroom, he suddenly saw Chu Yin walking with a boy not far away.The boy was not tall. His glasses were thick and he looked like a nerd.Chu Yin turned her head and said something to him. The boy nodded quickly.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes darkened a little bit.An indescribable impatience strangled his heart like a thread as his fingers tightened. He stood there, staring at her while inching a little close.What should he do? Should he hide? Or should he pretend not to see it?Lu Zhen looked at her before walking back to the classroom.The international class was the last lecture class. Chu Yin went back to Class 5 and drank a glass of water before continuing.The atmosphere of each class was pretty good. No one was looking for trouble. But Chu Yin knew that the last class was the key point. After all, several people in this class had names and surnames in the script.After entering the International Class, Chu Yin glanced around and saw that Lu Zhen wasn\u2019t present. She immediately felt happy.Lucky! The dog man left early.Just when she celebrated, a familiar figure appeared outside the classroom.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay.Tan Ke was surprised and asked, \u201cYou came back?\u201dLu Zhen sat down and looked up at the platform. \u201cSomething came up.\u201dIt turns out that she was here to give lectures.Liang Yueqi quietly turned her head back and observed Lu Zhen\u2019s expression. He didn\u2019t seem to be happy, and his expression was a little cold, just as usual. This discovery made her somewhat happy.Chu Qiuqiu sat in the middle of the third row. Seeing Chu Yin walking in, she felt upset.This idea, which the school thought of, was bad. What would these representatives talk about in class?Wasn\u2019t Chu Yin a fool for learning? Fu Mingxuan said that she would sit in her seat all the time just to study. If people would follow this study method, even fools would get higher marks.Chu Yin glanced at her fake sister and thought, If you don\u2019t mess with me, I won\u2019t mess with you.Then we\u2019ll have\u00a0peace &amp; love.But not long after she started talking, the first question came.Chu Qiuqiu asked with a smile, \u201cSister, is your time planning too harsh? We also have our own time allocation habits. We don\u2019t need to be so strict to achieve the same effect.\u201dChu Yin had no expression: \u201cOh, that\u2019s great.\u201dShe continued to talk about her time planning and then began to talk about her study habits, such as taking notes at any time in class, communicating with teachers more after class, and sorting out and reviewing notes in time.Although these were all conventional methods, only a few people could stick with them.Chu Qiuqiu asked again: \u201cSister, don\u2019t blame me for asking so much. What you said seems to be a very common method. I want to ask, as a liberal arts student, how do you remember the learning points?\u201dLu Zhen frowned and looked at the other side.Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s voice and tone annoyed her. Chu Yin wanted to block her mouth with something.It\u2019s sunny, and not raining. The weather is wonderful. Why are you doing this again?The snake dance last time wasn\u2019t enough to wake you up, huh?But in front of so many people, Chu Yin couldn\u2019t say that she had a golden finger. She thought for a moment and said, \u201cYou can refer to Ebbinghaus\u2019s memory curve and observe your brain\u2019s performance.\u201dAs soon as the voice fell, Chu Qiuqiu showed an eager expression again.Chu Yin saw her intention this time and directly knocked on the system: \u201cOpen the script.\u201d\u3010Location: International Class. Characters: Chu Yin, Chu Qiuqiu, Lu Zhen, etc.\u3011\u3010After Chu Yin finished lecturing, Chu Qiuqiu said with a confident smile: \u201cSister, that\u2019s not right.\u201dNext, Chu Qiuqiu delivered a long speech. She refuted Chu Yin with a scientific basis, and fully demonstrated her knowledge, depth, talent, and won a burst of applause.\u3011Okay, you want to discuss?Chu Yin moved the light pen, crossed out her [ speech ], and changed it into [ silence ].I won\u2019t let you talkIn the audience, Chu Qiuqiu confidently smiled as she shook her head, \u201cSister, that\u2019s not right.\u201dChu Yin showed an expression as if eager to listen to her.The whole class was also attracted by Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s sentence, waiting for her to speak.A second later, she wasn\u2019t speaking.A minute later, she still wasn\u2019t speaking.Chu Qiuqiu smiled and said nothing. The classroom fell into a strange silence.\u2014\u2014So what\u2019s wrong????\u2014\u2014Are you not talking??Chu Qiuqiu: I also want to talk!!!Why? Why doesn\u2019t my mouth listen??She tried so hard to open her mouth.She gave all her energy that she almost farted.After a long time of silence.On the podium, Chu Yin clapped her hands: \u201cWhat a wonderful speech!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked at the girl on the podium and thought that this little nerd had a sense of humor.Whether Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s speech was embarrassing or not, Chu Yin\u2019s applaud while praising her sister was adorable.Besides Lu Zhen, Tan Ke also couldn\u2019t hold back and chuckled.\u201cDamn, she\u2019s interesting.\u201dAlthough he vaguely felt that Chu Qiuqiu was a little aggressive just now, he didn\u2019t expect she would keep her silence after raising her hand to question. It was funny.It was not only him that found it funny, but many people in the class were actually holding back their snickers.But because Chu Qiuqiu was their classmate, they saved her some face.She finally completed her speech after silencing Chu Qiuqiu. She stepped back to the corner and waited quietly. When the second and third students finished speaking, they lined up before going out together.These three people were all good students. Seeing that they looked like elementary school students walking in line, people wanted to laugh.Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze fell on Chu Yin. She followed behind, her head slightly bowed, as her arms swayed back and forth. She was well-behaved.As Lu Zhen watched her leaving figure, he felt an unpleasant feeling.Although they knew each other, she didn\u2019t even spare him a glance.After they left, the International Class became noisy again. They originally thought that Chu Yin would be dull and boring, but today, the atmosphere became interesting.When Chu Yin left, Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s inexplicable silence restriction was lifted.She took a big breath before she quickly explained, \u201cI was suddenly speechless just now!\u201dThe classmates nodded reluctantly: \u201cIs that so.\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s not because Chu Qiuqiu was unable to speak, but more like she didn\u2019t know what to say. If she didn\u2019t know, why did she have to refute Chu Yin?Chu Qiuqiu knew that no one believed her. She was so anxious that her face turned red, \u201cReally! I was about to say that Ebbinghaus\u2019 curve data was based on his personal data, which may not apply to everyone!\u201dThe classmates had a confused look: Then why didn\u2019t you just say??Chu Qiuqiu felt a sense of powerlessness.This happened twice! First was at the school dance party. She suddenly began to dance weirdly! The second was today. She couldn\u2019t speak no matter how much she wanted to!If Chu Qiuqiu was smarter, she could connect more dots. For example, the taste of her red wine changed, the name of the ballot she made became hers, and so on. Unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t that smart.Chu Qiuqiu could only find one thing in common, that is, Chu Yin was present in both cases.\u2014\u2014Is it related to her?!Chu Qiuqiu couldn\u2019t help but rushed out of the classroom, found Chu Yin, who was not far away, and grabbed her: \u201cYou, demon!!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c??\u201dThat\u2019s a new title.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Chu Yin said coolly, \u201cSister?\u201dSeeing the strange eyes of the people around them, Chu Qiuqiu calmed down and said, \u201cWas it you?\u201dChu Yin looked at her and knew what she meant. After this fake sister was fucked over several times, she finally had doubts. Chu Yin wasn\u2019t worried about this. Instead, she wondered if Lu Zhen would notice something abnormal.Although the power of the golden finger lies in her mind, she still needed to be careful.Chu Yin stepped back a little further away from her: \u201cWas I\u2026what?\u201dFor the first time, Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s white lotus persona crumbled. She sneered while gnashing her teeth, \u201cDid you do something to me?\u201dMany students were coming and going in the corridor. When they recognized that the sisters were fighting, they didn\u2019t leave the scene.\u201cDamn, isn\u2019t that Chu Yin?\u201d\u201cAnd her sister\u2014\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation? Why does it seem like they\u2019re fighting?\u201dChu Yin was annoyed by the feeling of being watched. Her eyes became cold, \u201cMore like, what did you do to me? Has it been ten years already?\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face turned pale.Although there were not many people around her, she still had a feeling of being stripped off.Even though Chu Yin had been silent about this issue, she was actually proud of her identity as a real daughter, right? Will people find out?No! She must not let them know the truth!Chu Qiuqiu had forgotten her previous agenda and quickly made up with Chu Yin, \u201cSister, stop making trouble. I was just joking with you! Shall we go home together after school?\u201dChu Yin smiled and turned away: \u201cWho wants to go back with you?\u201dThis scene was seen by many people. After a while, someone posted a thread in the forum to discuss this matter.[Sister dispute? Is the relationship between the Chu sisters really bad?]The thread was about the situation that happened in the corridor.Anonymous 1: I think it\u2019s normal since they recently just lived together.Anonymous 2: I\u2019ve been wanting to mention this before. Am I the only one who thinks Chu Yin and Chu Qiuqiu look alike? Are they twins? Has the Chu family made any public statement regarding this?Anonymous 3: @2, even though they look alike, it\u2019s considered an insult.Anonymous 4: @3, I agree.Anonymous 7: When did the country bumpkin gather so many licking dogs?Anonymous 8: @7, If you\u2019re also a country bumpkin who can rank first place in the exam and win the billiards championship, I will lick you too.The following replies from the thread were distorted as two groups of people battled each other.In the classroom of Class 5, Song Zhaolin held his mobile phone with great interest.As both groups were tearing each other, he joined in and replied, \u201cYes! I\u2019ll lick you too!\u201dAfter he posted, numerous people cursed him.Song Zhaolin happily showed his mobile phone to Chu Yin: \u201cSister Yin, you\u2019re popular! So many people are fighting for you.\u201dChu Yin was so engrossed in her studies that it took a while for her to look up.These students are too idle.She took Song Zhaolin\u2019s phone, searched out pieces of swear words from the browser, and then copied it directly into the post and responded.As soon as these awe inspiring curses were posted, the thread became quiet.Then Chu Yin turned her head and nodded: \u201cFoul language leads to war.\u201dSong Zhaolin watched this whole set of operations and clapped in amazement.A few minutes later, the post was deleted.As a result, he cried loudly, \u201cSister Yin, because you used my account to scold them, I was banned! The restriction won\u2019t be released until a week later!\u201dChu Yin looked at him like a strict father: \u201cBrowse the forum less and focus more on studying, silly son.\u201dSince Song Zhaolin could only read posts and couldn\u2019t reply, his time browsing the forum decreased. Instead, he listened carefully for a while in class.Chu Yin completed today\u2019s learning task and got single word permission from the system.She was already familiar with the system\u2019s mode. The size of the reward directly depends on the difficulty of the task. Due to boosting her memory, her previous task level was also reduced. For example, for the same task, she could get more than a word as a reward, but now, she could only get one word.The highest authority that Chu Yin had obtained so far was a sentence. What\u2019s going on?\u201cThe host can imagine freely, oh ~\u201d, Xueji said.To obtain a higher level of authority, Chu Yin felt that she should seek more difficult tasks. For example, the last English speech contest was at the municipal level, so if she goes to participate in the provincial or national competition, would she get a higher authority?Chu Yin pondered for a moment.As a senior high school student, what was the most difficult learning task?College entrance examination?If she could get first place in the college entrance examination, how high would the authority be given to her by the system?Chu Yin\u2019s heart warmed slightly.This feeling of being able to dominate the world felt very good. This current life was more interesting than the previous life where she was stripped off of her freedom and killed.When the time comes, the dog man, the fate of dying early, the character of being the male lead\u2019s first love, would no longer stop her from reaching my dreams.Whenever she thought about this, she would be ignited with a passion for learning.Xueji silently watched, thinking: My King Yin is definitely powerful! [fist]\u201cCome on, are there any tasks?!\u201d Chu Yin banged the system fiercely.Xueji: \u201cYes\u2026\u201d It felt lucky that it met a host with a strong sense of professionalism.Chapter 27 \u2013 This is better!\u00a0(2)The cold wind of December was blowing.The atmosphere of Christmas on the campus had become more intense.For the past few days, the decorations for the Christmas event were slowly being transferred to the school building.Apart from preparing for the final exam, the students couldn\u2019t avoid talking about the Christmas party.\u201cHey, have you prepared your gift? What will you be giving this year?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything. I plan to buy a figurine just like last year.\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know what to give but I know what I want!\u2013I want Brother Zhen\u2019s gift!\u201d\u201cAlso Senior Qiu Ze\u2019s and Senior Chu Shi\u2019s! Ah!\u201dJiang Yan ran over to Chu Yin and sat in front of her during the breaktime, \u201cYin yin, have you thought about your gift? What are you going to give?\u201dAs soon as she asked, many pairs of eyes quietly looked over.Just like how most girls wanted to get Lu Zhen\u2019s gift, many boys in the class also wanted Chu Yin\u2019s gift.When Chu Yin was asked about this by Jiang Yan, she didn\u2019t think much of it.\u201cMaybe\u2026cookies?\u201d Chu Yin said with uncertainty.It was obvious she didn\u2019t have any other ideas since she chose the same gift in her previous life.But this didn\u2019t matter. She would make sure that it won\u2019t fall into Lu Zhen\u2019s hands again.Jiang Yan\u2019s eyes widened in surprise: \u201cYou\u2019re amazing! You can even bake!\u201dSince Chu Yin was a little princess in the family, Jiang Yan thought she only had studying in her mind. She didn\u2019t expect Chu Yin to know baking!Chu Yin waved her hand: \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s not difficult. I\u2019ll teach you next time.\u201dAfter eavesdropping for a long time, Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t help it, \u201cIs it going to be really cookies?\u201dHe also wanted Sister Yin\u2019s gift!Chu Yin nodded, then touched both Jiang Yan and Song Zhaolin\u2019s head before getting up to go to the toilet.As soon as she left, the boys immediately surrounded her: \u201cLin Zi, what is Chu Yin\u2019s gift?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cThe secret is only known to me and Xiao Yanyan.\u201dJiang Yan helplessly sighed.\u201cJust tell us!\u201d\u201cWhen the time comes, it will be a fair fight and anyone may get it!\u201d Song Zhaolin triumphantly refused.He didn\u2019t care if he must take advantage of being Chu Yin\u2019s desk mate. To get Chu Yin\u2019s gift, he must remember the appearance of her gift box!Hehehehe!!!\u2026On Christmas Eve, Chu Yin asked the driver to stop at the supermarket. She went in and bought low-gluten flour, butter, and a cookie jar.After dinner, she went upstairs to study. When there was no one downstairs, Chu Yin went to the kitchen.The baking utensils were complete in the Chu family\u2019s house. Since she was bored in her previous life, she used these things often.She first took the butter to soften, poured sugar, and stirred well with a spatula. After the eggs were beaten, she mixed it with the butter then whisked it evenly. The sifted low-gluten flour formed into a dough. At this point, the cookie was basically done.Next, she rolled the dough into sticks, wrapped it in plastic wrap, and refrigerated for a while. While waiting, Chu Yin went upstairs to do her homework.Then she went downstairs again, took out the dough sticks, cut them into small round cakes, and placed them on the oiled-paper of the baking pan. It was then put inside the pre-heated oven.It wasn\u2019t long before the smell of sweetness came out of the kitchen.Chu Shi smelled it when he went downstairs and unconsciously walked along the fragrance.\u201cAre you baking cookies?\u201dChu Yin looked back and saw her brother: \u201cYes, for tomorrow\u2019s gift.\u201dChu Shi was silent for two seconds then pretended to ask nonchalantly, \u201cYin yin, what gift box are you planning to use? I still have some spare ones. Do you want to use mine?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin said, \u201cBrother, if you want to eat it, you can just tell me.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Chu Shi nodded, \u201cI want to eat.\u201dChu Yin laughed.The biscuits were baked quickly and came out in the oven after half an hour.Chu Shi couldn\u2019t wait to taste it. \u201cDo you really want to give it away?\u201dChu Yin said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll give you enough cookies to eat first.\u201dChu Shi was satisfied and even ate a few pieces before asking: \u201cDo you want to give it to them?\u201dChu Yin paused for a moment, knowing that he was referring to their parents and Chu Qiuqiu. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you. You can give them if you want.\u201dChu Shi immediately said, \u201cYou have the right to decide since you made it. Since you gave me the right, then I won\u2019t give it away. I want to eat all of it.\u201dChu Yin had no attachment for the Chu family, which was obvious to Chu Shi. He didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with it. It was understandable she didn\u2019t have any love for them.If his sister was willing to get along well with him, he was already satisfied.The siblings ate lots of cookies before Chu Yin set aside some cookies for the gift.Then she looked down at the mess she made and planned to clean it and throw it all away. Because Chu Shi ate so many cookies, he was obliged to take out the garbage. He happily pushed Chu Yin back to her room then went out to take the garbage.It\u2019s Christmas Eve.Lu Zhen wandered around the Chu\u2019s villa area for a long time.The cold wind blew his coat. Even though Lu Zhen felt his scalp going numb from the cold, he didn\u2019t go back.He wanted to take a chance to say \u2018Happy Christmas Eve\u2019Lu Zhen walked back and forth many times for a long time before the gate of the Chu\u2019s villa opened.His heart felt like it was tightened as he calmly walked over. He looked up and was suddenly met by Chu Shi\u2019s happy and rosy face.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dThe two pairs of eyes stared at each other for a moment, an unpleasant aura sparked from each side.As Chu Shi walked past Lu Zhen to throw the garbage out, he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t it too cold to stay outside right now?\u201dLu Zhen said coldly: \u201cJust passing by.\u201dChu Shi said, \u201cOh..it\u2019s warm inside my home. I just ate my sister\u2019s cookies.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cWhich sister?\u201dChu Shi laughed brilliantly: \u201cSister Yinyin.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dChu Shi left after throwing the trash. He closed the gate and turned off all the lights in the first floor.Lu Zhen stood in the wind and sighed softly after a long time.He felt sour.The next day, which was the Christmas event, Song Zhaolin surprisingly arrived early. As soon as he sat down, he saw a lot of chocolates on Chu Yin\u2019s table. There were all kinds of brands, flavors, and shapes.When he compared to his table, there was only a piece of triangular chocolate.After looking around the classroom, he realized everyone received triangular chocolate. It was purchased by the class monitor using the budget of the class.\u201cSo dry.\u201d Song Zhaolin felt sad for a long time.After a while, Chu Yin came. Song Zhaolin immediately entered a state of preparation.Chu Yin looked at the pile of things on her desk, a little surprised. She could feel that the attitude of her classmates to her was different from before. She had never received this kind of treatment in her previous life.It doesn\u2019t feel bad.Chu Yin put down her school bag and took out her gift box casually under Song Zhaolin\u2019s sneaky eyes.Song Zhaolin was shocked and called out, \u201cSister Yin, you are too sloppy!\u201dHe immediately found a white box with no bow or pattern on it! \u201cYou\u2019re not afraid that no one will choose this?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dSong Zhaolin took the box under the table, forced her to paint a blue, green and fluorescent yellow box with a colorful pen. Then he drew a cross with a pink pen and added a bow.\u201c\u2026\u201d After Chu Yin saw it, she almost exploded, \u201cThis is even uglier!!\u201dSong Zhaolin smiled, placed the gift inside the table hole for her, and happily ran away.\u201c\u2013Remember to secretly put the gift. Don\u2019t be seen!\u201d\u2019Chu Yin reluctantly reached out and pushed the gift deep into the table hole, feeling very embarrassed.Just as she was about to take out her hand, the back of her hand suddenly bumped into a cold thing deep inside the table hole. She took a look and saw a red fruit.\u00a01There was a ribbon tied to the fruit handle. Chu Yin looked at it and saw a fuzzy handwriting that said:\u201cHappy Christmas Eve.\u201dChu Yin felt it was a little strange.Chapter 27 \u2013 This is better!\u00a0(3)Christmas Eve was over, how could someone send apples?After the students separately placed their gifts under the Christmas tree, they would hurriedly run away.Song Zhaolin happily fled to the International Class after placing his gift.In the back of the classroom, Lu Zhen laid on the table, sleeping.Song Zhaolin sat down: \u201cBrother Zhen didn\u2019t sleep well?\u201dTan Ke shook his head saying he didn\u2019t know. Brother Zhen came very early today. When Tan Ke arrived, Brother Zhen was already sleeping here.When Lu Zhen woke up, he frowned as he straightened up.He went to Class 5 very early and placed the apple inside her table instead of the words he couldn\u2019t say on Christmas Eve.Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t help sharing his joy with his brothers. \u201cI will definitely get my deskmate\u2019s gift this year!\u201dLu Zhen was originally sleepy but was suddenly woken up by this. He looked at Song Zhaolin.Tan Ke laughed at him: \u201cHow could that be? Many people are eyeing that gift already.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyes lowered slightly and he did not speak.Song Zhaolin smiled triumphantly, \u201cI have mastered the appearance of my deskmate\u2019s gift!\u201dSong Zhaolin, an extreme talker, couldn\u2019t hold his mouth and spilled all the beans himself without Lu Zhen and Tan Ke asking him, \u201cShe originally had a white box, but I painted it colorfully with a pink cross in the middle. Hahaha!\u201dTan Ke was stunned, \u201cYou\u2019re a horrible person!\u201dAt the side, Lu Zhen finally laughed.\u201c\u2026Oh. \u201cNow I see.The gifts were not collected until after the classes were finished in the afternoon. The most exciting gift-drawing arrived.As soon as time came, the hall on the first floor was filled with people.Gifts were piled up under the Christmas tree. The school security was in full alert to maintain peace and order.\u201cYou can only pick one! You can\u2019t go back once you choose a gift!\u201d\u201cGo in a group! Stay calm so we can avoid stampedes!\u201dThis event was one of the old traditions of Huiwen. Although everyone was excited, the order in the school still existed.Chu Yin was dragged by the enthusiastic Jiang Yan to line up. They walked under the tree after lining up for ten minutes.\u201cWow, there are so many. How can we choose which gift to pick?\u201dThere were piles of gift boxes\u2013small and large, to choose from. It was really amazing.The girls who came in with them were very excited.\u201cI overheard in the International Class that Lu Zhen\u2019s gift box is black!\u201d\u201cReally? Ah, ah, I see the black one!\u201d\u201cI saw it first!\u201d\u201cNo, I did!\u201dAfter listening, Chu Yin took away the nearest white box.Jiang Yan hadn\u2019t chosen yet so she turned and said, \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me. It\u2019s too chaotic here. You can go back first.\u201dChu Yin nodded, walked out from under the tree, and opened the gift which looked similar to hers. It was like getting a gift from herself.Xueji: \u201cHost, can you guess the person who gave that box?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cSo many people, how can I guess?\u201dAfter she finished speaking, she had a bad premonition.If it wasn\u2019t Xueji didn\u2019t know, it wouldn\u2019t say that.She looked silently at the box in her hand.It\u2019s not, right?No way.She stopped, took off the gift cover, and pulled out a velvet cloth lining.\\On top of it was a piece of pure gold\u2014Buddha statue.In the lower right corner, there was a name\u2014Second year, International Class, Lu Zhen.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dA few seconds later, Chu Yin turned around and walked back.Many girls were still looking for the gift box: \u201cThe black one just now is not Lu Zhen\u2019s!\u201d\u201cWhich one is his?\u201dChu Yin approached the gift pile sneakily, trying to put the hot thing back.Who knew that before bending down, a security personnel stared at her, \u201cClassmate, you are only allowed to take one! No changing of gifts!\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019ve drawn is because of fate.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe scolded Lu Zhen in her heart. Just as she passed the corner in the process of returning to the second floor, she was suddenly stopped.\u201cGood student.\u201dChu Yin looked up and saw Lu Zhen leaning against the wall, smiling while nodding towards the box in her hand.\u201cYou got mine.\u201dChu Yin wanted to throw the box on his face.\u201cPure gold Buddha.\u201d Lu Zhen looked down at her, \u201cDo you like it?\u201dYes, I like it so much. I love it.Chu Yin was expressionless, \u201cClassmate, since you are devoted to goodness, why don\u2019t I do this?\u201dLu Zhen didn\u2019t expect that she would take the initiative to speak to him. He subconsciously straightened up and stared at her closely.Chu Yin said, \u201c\u2013I will donate this Buddha to help more people.\u201dLu Zhen was surprised.After a while, he laughed. The smile in his eyes was clear.\u201cGive it. It\u2019s yours anyway.\u201dChu Yin came back to the classroom speechless.Song Zhaolin was crying. \u201cHow could that happen! Who is it! Who took my present?\u201dChu Yin was a little surprised: \u201cYou didn\u2019t get it?\u201dSong Zhaolin slapped the table: \u201cI painted it so ugily. Why would someone snatch it! It\u2019s unreasonable.\u201dChu Yin sat down in her seat with a foreboding feeling.Xueji: \u201cHost, guess who took yours away.\u201dChu Yin said, \u201cUnlock the script!\u201dA few seconds later, the script opened, with a big headline:\u3010Lu Zhen got the gift from Chu Yin.\u3011Chu Yin\u2019s eyes turned black.\u2014\u2014Junk script!! Rubbish!!!She exchanged gifts with Lu Zhen again. Is there any reason for this!!Ah, ah, I\u2019ll kill Lu Zhen!!Chu Yin seized the light pen without hesitation\u2014\u2014\u3010Lu Zhen returned to the classroom, quietly opened the box in his hand, and pulled out a box of cookies from it. The fragrance has faded, but it can still be seen that it was hand-made.\u3011Chu Yin\u2019s brain began to run wild.Give him a box of\u2026Flies? Caterpillars?Dog poop?Chemical and biological weapons??Chu Yin allowed her imagination to run in an extreme direction.No, it seems too obvious.Who would put these things in a gift box?Why does she want to make a big change just for a dog man?Chu Yin turned to the system and asked, \u201cHow many permissions do I have?\u201dXueji: \u201cTwo [change word] permissions. Oh ~\u201dChu Yin read the script again.\u2026\u2026Lu Zhen returned to the classroom and took out the box from his pocket.The colors of the highlighter were mixed together, making it look very ugly after it dried. But Lu Zhen didn\u2019t care.He admits that he is shameless.Among the students in their grade, it was only them who exchanged gifts.Exclusively for them.Will it be the cookies Chu Yin baked last night? The one that Chu Shi mentioned.The cookie that made him think about all night.Lu Zhen unconsciously rubbed his knuckles as he carefully opened the box like a treasure.Then, slowly, he pulled out\u2026Three keys\u00a01Lu Zhen: \u201c??\u201dAt the other end of the classroom, Chu Yin put away the script and smiled relaxedly.Although the gift was moderate, the meaning behind it was profound.\u2014\u2014Do you have three keys for ten yuan?\u2014\u2014How many pairs do you want!!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am Not Fit to Be the Male Lead\u2019s First LoveCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 28 \u2013\u00a0Come (1)Lu Zhen thought about the meaning of the gift.He looked down at the three keys. First, he examined the materials.Is it silver? Platinum?Lu Zhen flipped and looked at it carefully. Then he smelled the rust from his fingertips.Oh\u2026 it\u2019s made of iron.Lu Zhen crossed his arms. His face was calm while he continued to think.After a long while of fruitless thinking, Lu Zhen carefully put the three keys aways and decided to ask for help. He turned to call Tan Ke.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Brother Zhen?\u201d Tan Ke raised his head after he finished playing a game.Lu Zhen asked: \u201cIf someone gave you a key\u2026\u201dTan Ke waited for his words: \u201c\u2014and?\u201dLu Zhen looked at him: \u201cWhat does it mean?\u201dTan Ke felt it was bizarre: \u201cGifting a key?? What do you mean? Is there anything particular about it?\u201dLu Zhen sighed softly. Forget it.He thought about it, took out his mobile phone, and searched Baidu for \u201cthe meaning of receiving the key as a gift\u201d.Actually, someone had asked this question\u2014\u2014#What do girls mean by giving boys keys_ Baidu knows#Lu Zhen\u2019s eyebrow raised. This is it.Best answer: Every woman is a unique lock. If she gives you a key, it means that she thinks you are the one who can open her. She has fallen in love with you.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe hand holding the mobile phone trembled slightly.His heart burned uncontrollably before it cooled down after realizing that Chu Yin didn\u2019t know to whom her gift would go.Lu Zhen threw his phone under the table and leaned back in his chair.What a rubbish answer.The noise around the Christmas tree finally died down after everyone received their own presents. A few gifts that no one chose were distributed to security personnel.Everyone looked at each other\u2019s gifts. Some students who knew the appearance of their secret love\u2019s gift skillfully picked them out. At this moment, the students started to discuss.Amidst the joyful season, Song Zhaolin was the only one who wasn\u2019t happy.He couldn\u2019t find his Sister Yin\u2019s gift.He looked around him and saw that Zhao Yuxiong got his favorite figurine, while Jiang Yan got a cute doll. Meanwhile, the gift he got was a car model from a male classmate of Class 3! Not romantic at all!!Fortunately, after seeing the gift that Sister Yin got, Song Zhaolin felt that he was not the worst.\u201cPoof, who will send a Buddha statue? Hahahaha\u201dChu Yin blankly thought\u2013probably a psycho.Song Zhaolin only glanced at it and didn\u2019t see that it was pure gold. He only thought it was strange and exotic.\u201cSister Yin, have you seen the name? Who sent it? Haha!\u201dChu Yin was aloof, \u201cMaybe an abnormal donor.\u201dSong Zhaolin felt more comfortable and strolled to see what his brothers had drawn. Did they have a wonderful fate?After entering the international class, he saw Lu Zhenz holding his arms in a contemplative look.\u201cBrother Zhen, you can ask Lin Zi. He might know the meaning.\u201d Tan Ke said.Lu Zhen had no hope for Song Zhaolin, but it was better than nothing. He still asked, \u201cWhat does it mean to send three keys?\u201dSong Zhaolin said \u201cAhh\u201d and then laughed. \u201cThree keys for ten yuan!1\u201dTan Ke\u2019s face was unpleasant.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dDamn.It doesn\u2019t matter.Anyway, whatever it means, the keys were his.Chu Yin gave it to him.Song Zhaolin and Tan Ke fought with words for a while before Song Zhaolin fell on Lu Zhen\u2019s front desk, crying exaggeratedly. \u201cUhuhu\u2026why didn\u2019t I get my deskmate\u2019s little cookies\u2026ahhh-\u201dTan Ke laughed: \u201cHow can you have a chance? Many students want her gift too.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows suddenly raised.\u201cWhat did you say her gift was?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cLittle cookies.\u201dIt was Chu Yin\u2019s present that he took away. Yes, there was her name in it. Lu Zhen originally thought she would send her own cookies, but after opening, there were several keys.Was Song Zhaolin wrong? If Chu Yin indeed planned to gift some cookies, what happened to the gift?But how could her gift be replaced? Lu Zhen searched in the gift pile for a long time before seeing Chu Yin\u2019s inconspicuous little box. Who would deliberately find it from hundreds of boxes and change the item inside?Except for the possibility of sudden change.But that\u2019s ridiculous.Lu Zhen\u2019s face remained silent, and a faint suspicion floated in his heart.Song Zhaolin cried and hawed, \u201cI don\u2019t know which bastard took it away. I envy that he can eat it\u2026\u201dThe bastard himself was silent.After a long time, Lu Zhen sighed.He didn\u2019t get it either.Song Zhaolin also sighed in sadness.Two men who didn\u2019t get Chu Yin\u2019s cookies.Sad.jpg\u2026\u2026In the evening, at the end of Christmas, the Huiwen students who had been excited for a whole day finally remembered something.There was a post in the forum:[So who has taken away the gifts of those \u201ckey targets\u201d?? ]School\u2019s apollo, Lu Zhen.\u00a0 School flower\u2026Forget it, it\u2019s not the school flower. The quasi school\u2019s flower, Chu Yin.\u00a0 The former school\u2019s apollo Gu Qiuze. And the other star juniors and seniors.After a while, students began to post, claiming the gift they got.Anonymous 10: Gu Qiuze\u2019s is here with me ~ senior is so gentle, and he also included a card ~ Wuwu, I\u2019m in love~Anonymous 11: Ah, ah, ah, I admire it!!!Anonymous 12: What luck is this!\u2026\u2026Anonymous 23: the one I picked is from Chu Shi. The gift is very practical. HahahaAnonymous 24: I\u2019m so jealous!!Anonymous 25: What did I do wrong to not receive their gifts!!The next posts were about claiming Chen Yanfei\u2019s and Fu Yungting\u2019s gifts. Who didn\u2019t want to get a gift from good-looking people? It would be a wonderful fate to be acquainted with them.The forum thread reached the 100th post. The gifts of the key-targets were claimed, but the gifts of the two popular people hadn\u2019t been announced yet.Anonymous 157: So who picked Brother Zhen\u2019s gift? Do you want to keep it a secret?Anonymous 158: Last year, the person who got Brother Zhen\u2019s gift immediately announced it to spread his luck. No one would ever hide it.Anonymous 160: What if the security personnel picked it??Anonymous 161: Ah, no!! Then I will cry right now!The whole forum\u00a0 was in silence, and soon someone asked, \u201cWell, did someone get Chu Yin\u2019s?\u201dAnonymous 180: I also want the beautiful sister\u2019s gift!Anonymous 182: @180, Stand up against your enemies.\u00a02Anonymous 183: [Holding a kitchen knife]After the night ended with no one claiming they got Lu Zhen and Chu Yin\u2019s gift, the whole school unanimously determined that these two gifts, which were sought after by many people, fell in the hands of the security personnel.This was one of the most unfortunate events of the year.After Christmas, the exciting activities in the school finally ended. The students then began to prepare for the final exam.From the excitement of the sport\u2019s event to the Christmas event, Class 5 realized that there was a figure in the class that never changed.They watched all the games and participated in a variety of sports. However, Chu Yin only watched a basketball match and participated only in a billiard game.The most frightening was that most of them only won third place while some didn\u2019t win any prize at all. But Chu Yin, who only participated once, won a champion prize.In addition, Chu Yin didn\u2019t pay any attention to these dazzling activities. The mathematics teacher even praised her two days ago, saying that Chu Yin was more mature and calmer than the rest. At that time, the students were busy with these fun activities that they didn\u2019t listen to the teachers. Thinking back now, she really didn\u2019t stop studying even for a day.Because of this, many students felt a sense of crisis.\u2013She is the first rank in the grade!!If the first-rank student studied so hard every day, what qualifications did they have to relax!Teacher Wang was satisfied as she looked at the slowly recovering learning atmosphere in the class. If it was not for Chu Yin\u2019s late admittance to the school, she would have appointed her as a class monitor. This child had stability and patience beyond the kids\u00a0 her age.After class, Teacher Wang mentioned Chu Yin with her eyes and asked her to come to the office.\u201cHow are you doing recently? Are you tired of learning so much?\u201dChu Yin was a good student in front of the teacher. She smiled and shook her head: \u201cNot tired.\u201d\u201cBecause you transferred here and don\u2019t know about the situation, I will tell you\u201d Teacher Wang patted her arm, \u201cOur school has places to participate in the mathematics provincial competitions every year. This is called \u2018The Hope Cup\u2019 competition. It\u2019s the most suitable mathematics contest for liberal arts students. Are you interested?\u201dTwo days ago, Chu Yin was considering taking part in a higher-level competition. Naturally, she did not hesitate: \u201cI am interested, teacher.\u201dTeacher Wang was very satisfied. She knew that Chu Yin was ambitious!\u201cThen at the end of this semester, please prepare well. Our school is like this. The top three in mathematics at the end of the semester exam can be recommended to participate in the Winter Camp of Hope Cup. You receive training and assessment in the winter camp. After selection, you can participate in the final competition.\u201dT/N: Chu Yin will be focusing on her studies at this period so the story will get a bit boring. I\u2019ll be uploading 3x a week beginning March for this reason so we\u2019ll get past that mundane phase quickly~ :3 BY THE WAY, thank you so much for all your comments! I really appreciate them! ^^ I don\u2019t get tired reading your comments. I would like it if you continue to write your comments. That way, I\u2019ll know what you guys think.Chapter 28 \u2013\u00a0Come (2)Chu Yin understood that she needed to do well in Mathematics before the school term ended.\u201c\u2013But don\u2019t be too stressed,\u201d Teacher Wang said, \u201cI\u2019ve seen your answer sheet in the last midterm exam. It\u2019s very good. I can\u2019t find students that are better than you in your grade so you just need to study as usual. That\u2019s it.\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cI understand. Thank you, teacher!\u201d\u201cWhat are you thankful for? Come on, you can go back.\u201dThe other math teachers in the office looked at her with envy, \u201cMs. Wang, is this the child that placed first in the grade?\u201dTeacher Wang said proudly, \u201cYes. She got a perfect score in both English and Math. And also ranked first in the comprehensive exam.\u201dThe teachers were envious: \u201cHow clever! Do you think this child can win the prize in the contest?\u201dTeacher Wang didn\u2019t want to be too high-profile. She waved her hand, \u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it after the final exam. Moreover, Class 1 and Teacher Chen\u2019s International Class also have many students who are good at math.\u201dTeacher Chen was an old man. He sat in the corner of the office, shaking his head while holding a teacup in his hand, \u201cThe best math student in my class doesn\u2019t want to participate no matter how good he is!\u201d\u2026After Chu Yin came out of the office, she quickly poked the system: \u201cIs it time to release the provincial competition task next?\u201dShe wanted to see how the rewards were after completing these kinds of tasks on this level. Would she be given permission to change two sentences? Paragraphs? It would be cool.Xueji: \u201cNonono~ host must complete both the task of ranking first in the whole grade first and placing first in the math exam~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dShe turned back to her class, pondering over the problems she would choose to do, but she met Lu Zhen again.How high were the chances of meeting this dog man frequently in the corridor?She remembered that Lu Zhen didn\u2019t like to move much in her last life. He usually stayed in the classroom.Chu Yin glanced at Lu Zhen\u2019s lazy appearance while holding a cup of ice coffee in his hand, as if he had come out to buy this.After seeing her, Lu Zhen\u2019s lips curled, \u201cGood morning, good student.\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cHello.\u201dA few people passed by and couldn\u2019t help looking sideways at them.Before when Chu Yin was still wearing a mask, the whole school couldn\u2019t accept them talking to each other. But when Lu Zhen and Chu Yin greeted each other now, they didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong.Quasi-school\u2019s flower, Champion in the English Competition, Queen of Billiards\u2026many labels were placed on Chu Yin, making her an existence that others wanted to talk to but dared not to.What\u2019s more\u2026this picturesque scene was too eye-catching.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to be in the same frame as Lu Zhen. Right after greeting him, she wanted to leave.But Lu Zhen leaned forward, blocked her, and suddenly said, \u201cWhere\u2019s the cookie?\u201dChu Yin raised her eyes.Lu Zhen lowered his head and looked at her with a smile in his voice: \u201cI got your gift.\u201dChu Yin immediately realized that it was probably Song Zhaolin\u2019s big mouth that revealed what\u2019s inside the gift box.But what does Lu Zhen mean?Was he testing her? What did he find?Why did the original cookies become three keys?But no matter how keen Lu Zhen was, he could not have guessed that such things were contrary to logic or even strange.Chu Yin took a breath, looked up and explained, \u201cI later thought the key was more meaningful, so I changed it.\u201dLu Zhen slightly raised his eyebrows and looked at her with a smile: \u201cWhat\u2019s the meaning?\u201dAlthough he knew that she was indifferent, he couldn\u2019t help but want to hear more from her. Even if she would say the same thing as what Song Zhaolin said, he was willing to listen.Chu Yin\u2019s face was tight as she spoke seriously, \u201cThe meaning is the three keys to life\u2013accept, change, and leave.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t accept it, you will make a change; if you can\u2019t change, you will choose to leave,\u201d said Chu Yin, \u201cDo not be greedy or paranoid. Be a simple, happy, and satisfied person .\u201dLu Zhen was going to speak but was stopped by her.Chu Yin finally said sincerely, \u201cCome on, classmate.\u201dWith that, the master of chicken soup turned and left.\u2026Not greedy, not paranoid, this was indeed Chu Yin\u2019s good wishes to Lu Zhen.Looking at Lu Zhen now, she could recall some of his appearance in her previous life.Although Lu Zhen was domineering in high school, he was just a normal young master. It would make sense that the cold and arrogant young master would get angry after being rejected by her.How did it come to cooking chicken soup?After graduating from high school, Chu Yin hadn\u2019t seen Lu Zhen for a while. Chu Yin didn\u2019t find out the reason why he disappeared since she spent all her last life fighting to live.With the amount of changes she made in this current life, will the dog man turn the same?No matter what, Chu Yin wouldn\u2019t allow herself to become a variable in Lu Zhen\u2019s life.In the evening, Chu Yin came home and noticed Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s eyes on her.This fake sister was observing her.After the last time she was forced to stop talking, she behaved for a while. It was obvious that until now, she hadn\u2019t given up her suspicion.Chu Yin was silent.\u00a0If the enemy won\u2019t move, I also won\u2019t move. Let\u2019s see what she\u2019s going to do.During dinner, Father Chu said, \u201cUncle Chen will visit our residence in a while. His son is the same age as you. You can get to know him.\u201dChu Qiuqiu knew that the Chen family was bigger than the Chu family, and was a good marriage partner. She was very positive and nodded with interest: \u201cOkay, I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201dChu Yin was silent.Father Chu glanced at her with dissatisfaction. Chu Qiuqiu felt proud when she saw his father\u2019s look towards Chu Yin.Chu Yin never knew how to seize the opportunity. She only had studying in her mind.Mother Chu didn\u2019t want a fight to break out at the dinner table, so she quickly changed to a relaxed topic: \u201cDo my daughters have good friends in school?\u201dChu Qiuqiu glanced at Chu Yin and smiled obediently: \u201cI have been quite acquainted with senior Zheng Yu. He is a classmate of my brother.\u201dChu Shi frowned.She didn\u2019t know that after Zheng Yu couldn\u2019t chase Xiao Yin, he would hook up with his other sister.Father Chu was very satisfied: \u201cThe boy of the Zheng family? Not bad, not bad! I have also seen that child. He is a talent.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe atmosphere was lukewarm as only Chu Qiuqiu and their parents spoke during dinner.After the dinner ended, Chu Qiuqiu walked around in the living room a few times, looking at Chu Yin who was sitting on the sofa drinking water.It happened that today their parents were at home. She wanted to try her chance and expose Chu Yin\u2019s abnormality!After thinking about it, Chu Qiuqiu came up with a test method. Since she suddenly danced and couldn\u2019t speak out of the blue, then she would use the opposite method to expose her.Chu Qiuqiu went over, sat down beside Chu Yin, and said, \u201cSister, what you said about the Ebbinghaus curve last time\u2026\u201dChu Yin looked at her: \u201cWhat?\u201dChu Qiuqiu looked at her and didn\u2019t speak.Chu Yin looked puzzled: \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dChu Qiuqiu was still silent.Chu Yin: \u2026\u201dChu Qiuqiu seemed to have spent time with her, staring at her in silence.Chu Qiuqiu looked at her silently, as if she was exhausted by her.There was a trace of familiarity with this situation, just like the situation in the international class that day.Chu Yin changed her mind and suddenly realized that Chu Qiuqiu was fishing her?Chuyin poked at the system: \u201cLet me look at the script.\u201d\u3010Chu Qiuqiu wanted to test whether the abnormal events that happened to her was because of Chu Yin. She decide to use the opposite behavior to induce her, so that she could explain to their parents that Chu Yin wasn\u2019t normal!\u3011After reading it, Chu Yin became more calm and relaxed.You want me to change it? Hey, I won\u2019t change~Chu Qiuqiu held back for a long time, opened her mouth, and found that she could still speak: \u201cYou\u2013\u201cChu Yin held the water cup and looked at her like she was a fool.Chu Qiuqiu bit her teeth, stood up, and suddenly began to dance in the shape of a snake!Chu Yin almost squirted the water in her mouth.Chu Qiuqiu went all out.She recreated the dancing scene of a wild and dominant snake as she looked at Chu Yin:\u00a0Come on! Do the same thing as you did to me!Come on!!At this moment, a voice sounded, \u201cQiu Qiu, what are you doing?!\u201dFather Chu and Mother Chu stood at the door of the living room, looking at their adopted daughter in shock.Chu Qiuqiu abruptly stopped.At this time, Chu Yin slowly turned around with a dignified face.\u201cSister seems to have a problem here.\u201d Chu Yin pointed to her skull, \u201cHurry up and take her to the hospital.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Was it some kind of neurological disease?Father Chu and Mother Chu were shocked. How could there be a problem after raising her for ten years?Father Chu wanted to be more practical. He originally thought that Qiuqiu had a good personality and was more reliable with social gatherings. Now if there was a problem with her\u2026Chu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t expect to be seen by their parents. She quickly explained: \u201cNo, I\u2019m just playing with my sister!\u201dSeveral people looked at Chu Yin.Chu Yin shook her head innocently: \u201cNo, I\u2019m not playing with you.\u201dChu Qiuqiu gritted her teeth. The problem was clearly Chu Yin! As a result, her parents and brother thought she was mentally ill.Father Chu: \u201cThere was originally a banquet in a few days. If Qiuqiu has problems\u2026\u201dOf course, his main priority would be the social gathering. If Chu Qiuqiu had this kind of problem, taking her out would certainly damage the face of the Chu family.\u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d Chu Qiuqiu hurriedly said, \u201cI was just exercising! It\u2019s good for the body to practice this kind of dance!\u201dFather Chu hesitated, \u201cIs that so?\u201dChu Qiuqiu quickly nodded while moving her lips to show that she was perfectly normal.After finally fooling her parents, Chu Qiuqiu turned her head to see that Chu Yin had already left.She fell down on the sofa and couldn\u2019t help thinking:\u00a0Is it really not related to Chu Yin?Was it because she was under too much pressure and something went wrong in her brain? Chu Qiuqiu shivered at the thought.As the Huiwen\u2019s final exam came nearer, the pressure in the school intensified.The \u2018Hope Cup\u2019 slots were given to the top three students in the final math exam, which was an old tradition of Huiwen. Class 5 was an elite class. The best students stood at the top of the pyramid.Students were willing to participate in this kind of competition if there was a chance. Even if they couldn\u2019t participate in winter camps or training sessions, their level would surely improve a lot.However, this year, it would be more difficult to be included in the slots because of Chu Yin. Everyone unanimously agreed that she would get a slot.Fu Mingxuan\u2019s math skill was also good. She also got 140 in the last midterm. If Chu Yin didn\u2019t get a perfect score in math, then she wouldn\u2019t have this kind of sense of crisis.She also wanted to participate in the Hope Cup and had seriously been studying these days. She started learning from Chu Yin\u2019s behavior and often went to the teacher to ask questions during break time.Near the end of the term, there were many papers distributed to them by the teachers. Song Zhaolin neatly folded them in half, sorted them, and placed them in front of him. He didn\u2019t want to write even a single paper.In order to improve his grades, he forced himself to write something on each paper.\u2014\u2014So he wrote his name in all the papers.After putting down his pen, Song Zhaolin no longer knew what to write after his name.Turning his head to look at Chu Yin, he saw she already finished her math papers.\u201cSister Yin, are you not bored with writing this many papers?\u201d Song Zhaolin asked while she was changing papers.Although he was close with Chu Yin and could make jokes with her, Song Zhaolin still dared not to disturb Chu Yin while she was studying. Also, Chu Yin had a cold\u00a01\u00a0posture, making others not dare to disturb her.Chu Yin picked up the paper and said, \u201cNo. It\u2019s so interesting.\u201dSong Zhaolin shrunk his head back. He felt he didn\u2019t deserve listening to this good student\u2019s speech.After class was over, Jiang Yan came over with the paper and wanted to sit next to Chu Yin, but Song Zhaolin refused.Jiang Yan had no choice but to sit in front of Chu Yin. \u201cYin, what should I do after this question?\u201dChu Yin changed a pencil and took the paper, \u201cLet me see.\u201dAlthough Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t understand, he also glanced at it with his head to show his enthusiasm for learning. After not understanding anything, he suddenly felt his head becoming grimmer.When he looked back, he found that they were surrounded by several people.Zhao Yuxiong touched his head: \u201cChu Yin, I want to listen too, okay?\u201dNext to Zhao Yuxiong was another boy, and there were two girls standing next to Jiang Yan, both of which came to listen to Chu Yin\u2019s topic.To speak to one person was also to speak to a group of people.\u201cThe second question is about three situations. When L1 and x-axis coincide, when L1 and x-axis are vertical, when L1 and x-axis are neither coincident nor vertical\u2026\u201dChu Yin spoke clearly in a low and soft voice. After teaching one method, she would give a second solution to solve the problem.Although they knew that Chu Yin was better than them, it was the first time they realized the difference in their gap. Jiang Yan asked the most difficult question on paper today and most students couldn\u2019t catch up.What\u2019s wrong with them?Why did their face suddenly turn red as if they\u2019re drunk??Song Zhaolin suddenly realized that his Sister Yin\u2019s charm was radiating.Li Jin, who was next to Zhao Yuxiong, said, \u201cIt\u2019s been months since school started. I think we should change the seating arrangements.\u201dJiang Yan immediately agreed and nodded: \u201cI think so, too.\u201dShe wanted to sit with Yin Yin!Several people around agreed: \u201cLinzi, you are delaying people\u2019s studies if you sit next to them.\u201dThis made Song Zhaolin angry. His eyes widened as he shouted: \u201cShit! I can make Sister Yin\u2019s mood happy because I\u2019m a charming person!\u201dChu Yin couldn\u2019t help laughing.Song Zhaolin immediately said, \u201cSee?\u201dZhao Yuxiong blushed and looked at Chu Yin. She was too beautiful when she laughed. When he looked closer, he could see dimples on her white and tender skin.He sourly said to Song Zhaolin, \u201cLin Zi, you\u2019re wasting resources.\u00a02. How about you let Jiang Yan and Chu Yin sit together? If you do, our class might get both the first and second place in exam rankings.\u201dJiang Yan agreed and nodded wildly.Song Zhaolin simply stretched out his head and pointed to his small brain, \u201cI don\u2019t care! I also need to improve!\u201dSeveral people wanted to say something but at this time the class bell rang. They could only reluctantly return to their respective seats.However, since it was the first time they talked to Chu Yin, they already felt satisfied.Song Zhaolin successfully defended his position as Chu Yin\u2019s deskmate. He greasily winked at her: \u201cSister Yin, you won\u2019t abandon me, right?\u201dChu Yin had already taken out the next set of questions.\u00a0 She patted him on the shoulder: \u201cCome on, Lin Lin, believe me or not, only achievements will not abandon you.\u201dSong Zhaolin vomited blood: Damn! So ruthless!But he loves it!!!In the evening, when Chu Yin came home, she found that there were guests at home.Gu Qiuze greeted her with a smile: \u201cHello.\u201dChu Yin replied politely.\u201cYour brother boasted about the cookies you made several days ago,\u201d Gu Qiuze looked at her and blinked, \u201cso I cheekily came here today. Can I eat them?\u201dChu Shi coughed twice, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Because he wanted to eat it again!Chu Yin glanced at Gu Qiuze and thought his wink was different from others.Song Zhaolin\u2019s wink sent out a signal of \u2018come and beat me.\u201d, but Gu Qiuze\u2019s wink clearly gave off seductive hormones.She nodded: \u201cYes, it just so happens that there are leftovers of the ingredients bought last time.\u201dGu Qiuze looked at her with a smile: \u201cI\u2019ll trouble you.\u201dChu Shi\u2019s wish was achieved. He was quietly happy.Chu Yin went upstairs to put her schoolbag first before going down to the kitchen. Gu Qiuze came forward and asked, \u201cIs there anything I can do to help?\u201dChu Yin shook her hands, \u201cNo need. It\u2019s very simple.\u201dShe combed her hair into a ponytail calmly. She had a sassy temperament when she raised her hand. Gu Qiuze touched his nose and stepped back.He looked at Chu Shi and said, \u201cSince I mentioned it, I should eat more of the cookies, right?\u201dChu Shi stared at him. \u201cYou think you\u2019re handsome!\u201dGu Qiuze raised his eyebrows. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to your sister later.\u201dChu Shi looked at him and thought to himself: Since he will become his brother-in-law, it wouldn\u2019t be too much right?But on second thought, Xiao Yin seemed to have no interest in Gu Qiuze. As her brother, he was deeply worried about this.He didn\u2019t know what kind of boys Xiao Yin liked. However, as long as it\u2019s not Lu Zhen, he was fine with whomever his sister would like.The cookies finished baking in just an hour. When Chu Yin called, both Gu Qiuze and Chu Shi rushed into the kitchen. The sweet smell of warmth filled the whole surrounding. Gu Qiuze kept on praising Chu Yin\u2019s cookies while eating. Chu Shi also did the same.Chu Yin felt full after eating a few pieces. The two boys seemed to be fighting for pieces of cookies more.She planned to bring some cookies for Jiang Yan and Song Zhaolin. Since Song Zhaolin wasn\u2019t able to eat it last time, she should give him a bite since he\u2019s a charming person.The next day, Chu Yin went to school with the cookies she made from last night.When Jiang Yan came into the classroom with her school bag on her back, Chu Yin called her secretly.Jiang Yan pinched the school bag\u2019s belt: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dChu Yin gave her a small packet of cookies: \u201cSnacks.\u201dWhen Jiang Yan smelled a sweet aroma, her eyes opened wide: \u201cDid you make it?\u201dT/N: Both me and Mary (my proofreader) have been busy lately. :'<\u00a0Forgive me for any mistakes in this chapter since this hasn\u2019t been proofread yet.\u00a0(also, if you like this story and would like to volunteer as a proofreader, I would gladly and heartwarmingly appreciate it.Chapter 29 \u2013 Damaging with criticisms (2)Chu Yin raised her beautiful eyebrows.Jiang Yan couldn\u2019t help hugging her: \u201cGod, Yin Yin, it\u2019s very kind of you. I\u2019ll finish everything!\u201dSeeing that she was so easy to satisfy, Chu Yin was in a good mood. She patted her head: \u201cIf you like, I\u2019ll bake something else for you next time.\u201dJiang Yan simply felt spoiled and happily went back to her seat.When it was time for class, Song Zhaolin hurried into the classroom.\u201cI was scolded by my brother in the morning. I was ordered to take the bus. Fortunately, I met Brother Zhen on the way, otherwise I couldn\u2019t come today!\u201dChu Yin snorted. These rich children\u2026they prefer dying than taking a bus. Chu Yin lived in a small town for more than ten years of her life. Buses were not bad.Song Zhaolin arranged his disheveled hair in front of his mobile phone\u2019s screen. Suddenly, a paper with a faint sweet smell was placed on the table.Chu Yin said, \u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201dSong Zhaolin was excited: \u201cOkay. It\u2019s that\u2013\u201cChu Yin nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dSong Zhaolin tremblingly raised the paper bag. This has! Cookies!!After she gave it to him, she lowered her head again and wrote two strokes. She suddenly realized something and turned to look at him: \u201cYou.\u201dSong Zhaolin was opening the paper bag when he looked up and said, \u201cAh?\u201d\u201cEat secretly,\u201d Chu Yin said, staring at him. \u201cDon\u2019t make it public for everyone to see.\u201dLest someone will see it.Song Zhaolin was even more moved\u2013is this exclusive their secret!He is the most special person in Chu Yin\u2019s heart!!Song Zhaolin was happy all morning because of the cookies. He ate the last piece of cookie and walked out of the classroom to play in the International Class. He remembered Sister Yin\u2019s unspoken warning, and although he was reluctant, he still obeyed it.Turning around, he ran into Lu Zhen head on.\u201cB-brother Zhen?\u201dLu Zhen stared at the cookie crumbs at the corner of Song Zhaolin\u2019s mouth.\u201cWho gave it?\u201d\u2026Chu Yin looked at the young man (LZ) in front of her and tried to make her thoughts and emotions empty.According to a certain law, what you don\u2019t want to happen will happen.In the corridor, Lu Zhen stood in front of her, blocking the light behind him. He bowed his head slightly and said in a low voice, \u201cI want it, too.\u201dSong Zhaolin received the cookies, why not me?His voice inexplicably overlapped with her memories a long time ago. In the previous lifetime, Chu Yin remembered that Lu Zhen would occasionally do the same thing when he was young. At that time, she just came from the countryside and thought it was absurd. He was obviously a young master from a wealthy family. How could he use such a humble tone?Chu Yin only glanced at him, not saying a word.Lu Zhen clearly saw the word \u2018why\u2019 in her beautiful peach blossom eyes.Why? How should I say it?Should I say I\u2019ve waited outside your house for a long time on Christmas Eve?Should I say I placed the apple on your desk on Christmas?Should I say I was looking forward to your cookies that day? I like the keys though.Then Lu Zhen found that he couldn\u2019t even say it.These actions that he couldn\u2019t control would probably scare her away.Lu Zhen took a breath, then said with a smile: \u201cAren\u2019t we friends.\u201dChu Yin was startled.No, this is a big misunderstanding, ah?Who are your friends? We have a blood feud, okay??Lu Zhen saw the obvious rejection in her eyes and smiled angrily. For the first time in his life, the young master was even rejected as a friend.He\u2019s helpless.He had no choice but to say, \u201cWasn\u2019t the gift supposed to be cookies\u2013if you hadn\u2019t changed it.\u201dThe word change was very subtle. Chu Yin\u2019s ears moved sensitively, and she was a little alert. After all, the dog man was not Chu Qiuqiu, and he was not so easy to fool.She thought about it and asked, \u201cWhy do you want to be friends with me?\u201dShe was completely different from her 17-year-old bright and cheery self in her last life. What kind of bookworm friend does Lu Zhen want? Does he like teasing nerds?Chu Yin observed his expression and thought that if he had any wrong thoughts, she would kill him tonight.Lu Zhen\u2019s hand slightly tightened. The corner of his lips curled up, \u201cBecause you are a\u2026very amazing person.\u201dChu Yin: ? It\u2019s the first time she heard that.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes lowered as he looked at her face. His heart was slightly hot. \u201cSince you appeared, a lot of wonderful things have happened.\u201dWonderful but uncontrollable chemical reactions.Some sour and hot heart beats, fuzzy, but gradually aggravating emotions.Since she appeared.But these beautiful words were interpreted differently in Chu Yin\u2019s ears.Wonderful thing?Is he talking about the knife falling from the sky? Driving at a speed of 180, and the basketball explosion? These wonderful things??When she thought of her artistic creation, Chu Yin felt guilty. What did Lu Zhen find?? No, she had to hold the dog man first!So Chu Yin nodded: \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll give it to you. You wait here.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows raised. He didn\u2019t expect this reaction from her. When Chu Yin turned and left, he obediently stood in his place, waiting for her to come back.Chu Yin returned to the classroom, took out the last small bag of biscuits from her bag and gave them to Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen looked slightly surprised, paused, and carefully took the paper bag in her hand.Chu Yin said solemnly, \u201cI\u2019m not wonderful at all. You think too much. I just like to study, and I don\u2019t care about anything else.\u201dWhat wonderful things? They have nothing to do with me.Lu Zhen pinched the corner of the paper bag, smiling slightly, \u201cI know.\u201d\u201cGoodbye, then. I\u2019m going to study.\u201dLu Zhen looked at her and said softly, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe girl\u2019s back was slender. Even if she was wrapped in a big school uniform, it\u2019s hard to look away.Lu Zhen watched her leave as he laughed softly.At the age of 17, he couldn\u2019t believe he actually blocked her to shamelessly ask for cookies.He\u2019ll probably remember it for the rest of his life.\u2026\u2026When Chu Yin returned to the classroom, she held her arm and thought for a long time.\u201cWonderful things\u201dIs that something that the dog man cares about? He normally wouldn\u2019t figure it out. But what if there was something she didn\u2019t know?\u201cChicken,\u201d Chu Yin knocked on the system, \u201cis your safety factor high?\u201dAlthough she doesn\u2019t want to be liked by Lu Zhen, it\u2019s hard for her to become his enemy in case there would be incidents.Xueji: \u201cVery high~\u201dChu Yin also felt that with her average human thinking, she also wouldn\u2019t be able to guess her golden finger.After pondering for a while, Chu Yin felt that she had to make extra precautions.Let the dog man realize that these \u201cwonderful things\u201d were irregular and had nothing to do with anyone.After all, she could operate it remotely \u221aAn alibi that was sufficient enough\u2013confuse Lu Zhen and let him fall into self-doubt!So Chu Yin began to flip through the script, looking for the right plot.Chu Yin finished two system tasks before she found a suitable plot that would happen after school.This script involved both Lu Zhen and Song Zhaolin\u3010Song Zhaolin was cut off by his eldest brother, so he had to continue to ride Lu Zhen\u2019s car. He sent a message to Lu Zhen and waited for him outside the school building. After a while, he saw Lu Zhen opened the glass door.\u3011\u3010When the door opened, Song Zhaolin smileed at Lu Zhen: \u201cLet\u2019s go, Brother Zhen!\u201d \u3011Chu Yin thought for a moment.There\u2019s a good audience at the school gate.She moved the light pen and crossed out the word \u201copened\u201d and changed it to \u201cbroke\u201d.Go all out, weird man!\u2026\u2026After school.Song Zhaolin said dejectedly, \u201cMy brother really wants to kill me.\u201dChu Yin said quietly, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cHe won\u2019t send me a driver,\u201d Song Zhaolin said wrongly. \u201cHe wants me to walk back.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYou want to walk back?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cNo, hee hee. I\u2019m riding Brother Zhen\u2019s car ~\u201dChu Yin had a gentle smile: \u201cOh, go quickly, Lin Lin.\u201dSong Zhaolin sent a wechat to Lu Zhen, and then went out of the school building. After a while, he saw Lu Zhen\u2019s figure.Many people saw Lu Zhen and couldn\u2019t help slowing down, wanting to walk with him for a while.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, went to the glass door, and opened it.\u201cWow!\u2014\u2014\u201dAll of a sudden, there was a loud bang.The door was broken.\u201cAh, ah\u2026What\u2019s the matter?\u201d There were sudden screams all around\u2014\u2014Lu Zhen\u2019s hand was still up in the air.And the shattered glass in front him.Song Zhaolin stupidly looked at Lu Zhen.After the last time he exploded the basketball, he broke another door.In the building, Lu Zhen slowly retracted his hand and looked at his palm.There was a trace of hesitation.Which was rare for him\u2026Is it really my power?T/N: If you see any mistakes in this chapter, please point it to me in the comments.

(1)The next day, when Chu Yin was at school, she met Jiang Yan.After they talked about yesterday\u2019s papers, Jiang Yan whispered to Chu Yin: \u201cHave you heard about it, Yin Yin?\u201dChu Yin asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI heard that\u2026\u201d Jiang Yan said quietly, half-covering her mouth with her hand, \u201cOur school\u2019s Apollo broke a door with one hand yesterday!\u201dChu Yin blinked: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of it.\u201dInnocent and simple.jpg\u201cHey, I know you don\u2019t watch forums but a lot of people were talking about this yesterday. Song Zhaolin was on the scene at the time. He said that Lu Zhen just pushed the door gently, and it crashed\u2013\u201cChu Yin shook her head and clapped: \u201cWow! Such innate power! So manly.\u201dJiang Yan: Hmm? Why does this seem familiar?However, her mind was relatively simple. She didn\u2019t think much about Chu Yin\u2019s attitude towards Lu Zhen but said: \u201cThe school attached great importance to it. Last night, they changed and fixed the door.\u201dChu Yin continued to shake her head and discredited Lu Zhen without guilt: \u201cIt\u2019s useless. This kind of door can\u2019t stand his fist.\u201dJiang Yan was fooled by her: \u201cReally, really?\u201dChu Yin had a serious face: \u201cIt\u2019s true. He can make a basketball explode and make the door crash. It\u2019s better to avoid him in the future. He\u2019s dangerous.\u201dJiang Yan nodded: \u201cI know.\u201dAs they were talking, they saw Lu Zhen\u2019s car had stopped at the school gate from a distance. When Lu Zhen got out of the car, Jiang Yan subconsciously hid behind Chu Yin.Chu Yin gently patted her arm, and then whispered, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dJiang Yan: \u201cOkay!\u201dAs soon as Lu Zhen completely got out of the car, Chu Yin had already left.Then, he realized that the eyes of the surrounding students seemed to have a trace of\u2026Inexplicable awe.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s not me.That door.I didn\u2019t break it.Lu Zhen took a breath, then walked calmly to school.Song Zhaolin saw him from behind and caught up with him: \u201cGood morning, Brother Zhen!\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cGood morning.\u201dAs soon as Song Zhaolin met him, he immediately started to babble his mouth: \u201cDamn, you don\u2019t know what happened. Many people were gossiping about it yesterday. They didn\u2019t dare say it using your name. Everyone communicated vaguely.\u201dLu Zhen raised his hand and pinched his eyebrows. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit strange.\u201dBut the time and location of this incident, the crowd present, and his actions were completely different. This made it harder for him to find clues.Song Zhaolin nodded, but he didn\u2019t get his meaning at all: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. Brother Zhen, how powerful your ability is, I want it!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen was silent for a moment, \u201cI had a physical examination yesterday. There was no abnormality.\u201dSong Zhaolin looked silly and sweet: \u201cBut many of the girls now feel secure if you\u2019re here~\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dForget it.The learning aura was completely revived.Among all kinds of rumors, the final exam was approaching day by day. After this week ended, there would be a three day holiday during new year\u2019s day before the final exam would commence.Although the students were facing the upcoming final exam this semester, they were still excited about the upcoming holiday.\u201cDon\u2019t be complacent. You should also study at home.\u201d Teacher Wang exclaimed, standing on the podium. \u201cThe papers that are distributed to you should be done daily. Remember to be diligent. I don\u2019t need to tell you the importance of the final math exam, right?\u201d\u201cWe know, teacher.\u201d Everyone replied, dragging their voices.Song Zhaolin counted the papers, on the verge of crying, \u201cTwo sets a day?? What kind of devil\u2019s workload is this! I\u2019m only a sophomore in high school. I\u2019m still a baby!\u201d\u201cYes, so you write two sets a day,\u201d Chu Yin said calmly. \u201cAdults like your dad write four sets a day.\u201dSong Zhaolin was speechless for a while. He didn\u2019t know if she wanted to talk about her father or talk about being herself being an adult.\u00a01You are only seventeen, Sister Yin. You are still underage!Chu Yin\u2019s eyebrows were raised. She almost forgot.She was still a 17-year-old girl, but the soul inside her was already in her twenties. After staying in school for a long time, she felt that her state of mind had become much younger, and she was very happy to get along with these high school students.In the International Class, the math teacher was talking about the same thing.Although many of you will choose to go abroad in the future, participating in more domestic competitions and winning awards will also help your application.\u201d The old teacher\u2019s gaze swept across the class with expectation.Hope Cup is a very important math competition in China. It has a high gold content. In previous years, our school only won the silver award. It was the senior whose surname is Gu in the third year of high school.The girls in the class suddenly applauded in amazement.Senior Gu Qiuze was really excellent. Although he was slightly inferior to Lu Zhen in appearance, he had a strong family background and was a god of learning!Lu Zhen leaned back in his chair, seemingly disinterested.The teacher continued: \u201cI heard from the teacher of Class 5 that in addition to the student who got first place (Chu Yin) in their class, there are many students who are willing to participate in the competition. I know that there are many capable students among you, and I hope you, students, will think about it.After hearing this, Tan Ke said, \u201cTeacher, are you drawing pies?\u00a02\u00a0A total of three places will be given. There are so many top students who want to go. Even if we have the heart, we can\u2019t do it!\u201dAfter he finished speaking, he saw Lu Zhen\u2019s thoughtful face. He didn\u2019t know what he was thinking.\u201cThe first place (Chu Yin) will participate?\u201d Lu Zhen asked.\u201cYes.\u201d Tan Ke said.\u201cYes, and then?\u201dTan Ke didn\u2019t expect that Lu Zhen would be interested. He scratched the back of his head: \u201cIt seems that she is going to take part in the winter camp to compete.\u201dLu Zhen nodded and retracted his gaze.It took Tan Ke a long time to respond.No\u2026how could Brother Zhen be interested in this kind of thing??\u2026\u2026When new year\u2019s day came, the weather had turned frosty cold.After Chu Yin woke up in the morning, she nestled in the quilt for a while before getting up to wash.During the holiday, the Chu parents were also at home. As usual, they showed great concern after knowing about the upcoming final exam.In the middle of the last term, they were still worried whether Chu Yin could pass all subjects in Huiwen\u2019s examination. This time, they were worried whether Chu Yin could keep the first place in the grade.And because Chu Yin\u2019s achievements were better, they were only focused on Chu Yin\u2019s achievements and hardly asked Chu Qiuqiu. Chu Yin looked at Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s unwilling face and thought that the rich parents were practical.\u201cUncle Chen is worried about affecting your examination, so his visit with the Chen family son will be arranged after the examination,\u201d Chu Father looked at his two daughters. \u201cUncle Chen heard that both of you have good academic performance, and he appreciates it very much. You can\u2019t let people down in this final exam!\u201dChu Qiuqiu said immediately: \u201cI will work hard!\u201dChu Yin was still speechless.She just thought silently, this young master surnamed Chen\u2013She had a vague impression, but she couldn\u2019t remember anything.But it didn\u2019t matter. It had nothing to do with her.After breakfast, Chu Yin went back to her room and started today\u2019s system task.In order to screen out the students who are suitable for the winter camp, the difficulty of the final exam would be increased. In order to adapt to the examination, Chu Yin also increased her training. In addition to the papers issued by the school, she also searched for the college entrance examination papers and the papers set by a famous school.As soon as Chu Yin began to do the questions, she sank into the sea of questions. Until she finished the 16 choices and filled in the blanks, she raised her head and moved her shoulders and neck a little, only to find that the snow began to fall outside the window.This was the first snow of the year.Chu Yin leaned back in her chair and looked for a while, then stood up and pushed open the window. She reached out her hand and caught several snowflakes in her warm palm, which were soon melted by her body temperature.If it snowed a little bit more, you could make a snowman and have a snowball fight, thought Chu Yin.Having seen enough snow, she tightened her clothes, took her hands back, and slightly shrunk her neck.Then she moved her eyes inadvertently and suddenly saw Lu Zhen passing by as he looked up the Chu family\u2019s villa under the window.Chu Yin: This is a bit too coincidental, right?Her hand was about to secretly close the window handle, pretending nothing happened, but the man outside laughed, \u201cI see you.\u201dThe environment in the villa was very quiet. Although his voice was not high nor low, Chu Yin couldn\u2019t pretend she didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201cOh, Hello.\u201d Chu Yin said dryly, standing in the window, \u201chaha, what a coincidence.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s dark eyes fell on her.Unfortunately.He has been waiting for a long time.Chapter 30 \u2013 My eyes! (2)He has been waiting for a long time.\u201cCome out?\u201d Lu Zhen asked.\u201c?\u201d Chu Yin: \u201cI\u2019m working on a math problem, it\u2019s not convenient.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips hooked, \u201cHow about I visit you inside?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis dog thief!!If the parents of the Chu family knew that she and Lu Zhen knew each other, they would try their best to make her and Lu Zhen develop well. Maybe they would hope to build up the tree of the Lu family through her.The trouble is endless.A few minutes later, Chu Yin came out wrapped in a thick coat.It\u2019s rare to see her not wearing a school uniform carefully. She wrapped herself into a thick ball of coat, round and cute.Her expression was obviously reluctant.Lu Zhen felt he was probably a little sick. He inexplicably wanted to laugh after looking at her.After she walked in front of him, she found that Lu Zhen\u2019s hair was slightly wet and his black coat had a deeper color on his shoulder.\u2014\u2014Is this dog man idle??Why do you stay outside on such a cold day?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Zhen exhaled, looked at her, and asked, \u201cChu Yin, you\u2019re good at math?\u201dChu Yin was a little surprised and said, \u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dLu Zhen lips corner a Qiao: \u201cOkay as in, having perfect scores?\u201dChu Yin was even more surprised.??You know and yet you asked!!Lu Zhen could see her eyes now. Although this little nerd didn\u2019t like to speak directly and was a bit fake, her eyes were clear, revealing some flashes of emotions. As long as he looked carefully, he could see them.Lu Zhen lowered his head. With a smile, he asked in a low voice: \u201cSo you will go to the competition?\u201dChu Yin was not sure what he meant for a moment, and cautiously replied, \u201cWell, it depends on the final grade.\u201dLu Zhen nodded. Then he was also going.On a snowy day, the young master stayed outside like a homeless person for a long time just to ask this question.Lu Zhen felt sick himself.But there was no trace of regret in his heart when he finally could ask her. Only when he looked at her could he feel his heart itch.Chu Yin was so confused by him. \u201cIs that what you want to ask? If nothing else, I\u2019ll\u2026\u201dLu Zhen called her: \u201cChu Yin, stretch out your hand.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cAh?\u201dLu Zhen laughed: \u201cI won\u2019t harm you.\u201dChu Yin refused: \u201cNo, it\u2019s all right.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyes lowered as he took a breath. He suddenly pulled her hand, opened it, then placed a cold object in her palm.Chu Yin\u2019s ears flushed in anger.How dare this dog man touch her!!!But before she had the time to pull her hand, Lu Zhen had already let go of her hand.The young man put his hand behind his back, rubbed his fingertips, then said in a slightly muffled voice, \u201cSince I happened to meet you, I\u2019m giving you this gift.\u201dChu Yin endured the bloody storm in her head and glanced at what he placed in her palm.It\u2019s an intricately carved wood fountain pen.Thank you for the cookies,\u201d the thin snowflakes fell lightly, and the boy\u2019s voice was soft, \u201cGo and study hard.\u201dAs if afraid she would not accept it, Lu Zhen went first this time, striding fast.Chu Yin looked down at the pen, lost in thought.Compared with the 800,000 watch that was forcibly exchanged in her previous life, Lu Zhen, who gave his pen in this life, seemed to be much more normal.What\u2019s the meaning of gifting a pen? Is it that he finally recognized that she\u2019s dedicated to learning and hopes that she can study hard?Could it be that with her unremitting efforts, there are signs of positive change in the dog-man?No, I still need to read more scripts and monitor his situation in real-time!Chu Yin, with a thoughtful face, went back to the room and checked the logo of the pen.Then she looked at the six-figure price.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dDog man is still the same sick man with the same style!!The three-day holiday was over and the final exam was coming.The examination room was still divided according to the results. Chu Yin was assigned to the last examination room because she had no previous results, and this time, her name slip was posted on the number one of the first examination room.Probably the student with the largest ranking span in the history of Huiwen.Fu Mingxuan arrived early. When she walked into the first examination room, she found the name pasted on the first table next to the door. She was upset.Her seat was the fourth in the first column, and Chu Yin passed her several places.However, Fu Mingxuan scanned again and saw Chu Qiuqiu sitting in the seventh and last seat of the column. She felt comfortable again. As soon as she got comfortable, she got excited.Fu Mingxuan put her schoolbag on her seat, then walked to Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s seat with a smile on her face: \u201cBabe~ you arrived so early.\u201dAfter years of plastic love, Chu Qiuqiu certainly knew what she was doing here, and showed a standard smile: \u201cOkay, Xuanxuan, you\u2019re not too late.\u201dFu Mingxuan sat down on the seat in front of her and sighed, \u201cI found that your position is better than mine. I can see the clock as soon as I look up. I have to look up at the clock while sitting there.\u201dAlthough Chu Qiuqiu was angry and felt that her blood was surging up, she held it back. She laughed and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Your position will change over time anyway.\u00a0 You may not sit there next time.\u201dFu Mingxuan: \u201c..\u201dThe two people openly and secretly fought until most of the students arrived in their seats. The room was full of students of the same grade. After studying for more than a year, everyone in the room basically knew each other.Focusing on the difficulty of the exam and the number of slots available in the Winter Camp of the Hope Cup, the top students chatted with each other. The level of excitement was no less than that of the final exam room.At this moment, a figure floated into the classroom.The noise in the class stopped abruptly.Chapter 30 \u2013 My eyes! (3)This was the only new face in the examination room. And she sat in the first position.Fu Mingxuan and Chu Qiuqiu looked at the far back of Chu Yin, and suddenly had no courage to fight her.Chu Yin said hello to Jiang Yan in the second row with a smile and then sat down in her seat.She took her pencil case from her bag and got her 2B pencil and rubber eraser that would be used in the exam. She casually took her note to review.Behind her was Han Chuying of Second Year- Class 1 who she talked to last time.She was a little excited when Chu Yin came in.Last time she talked about her close contact with Chu Yin in the forum thread, but this time it was even closer!Han Chuying\u2019s desk was next to the back of Chu Yin\u2019s chair, and she felt that she could touch Chu Yin\u2019s ponytail. And from the back, she could see Chu Yin\u2019s good hair quality, white skin, and beautiful neck.She is beautiful even from the back.How can there be such a pleasing existence!Maybe her stares were too hot that Chu Yin noticed. She slightly turned around and asked her, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dHan Chuying suddenly saw a close-up, Ultra HD, and a flawlessly beautiful face.She only had one idea at the moment, that is, Chu Yin would always be first in the exam, and she would always be second so that she could always sit behind her in the exam.\u201cNo, no,\u201d Han Chuying endured, but after a while, she couldn\u2019t control it, \u201cYou look so good!\u201dChu Yin was stunned, didn\u2019t expect the other party to be so straightforward: \u201cThank you?\u201dSeeing that she\u2019s not as cold as she thought, Han Chuying couldn\u2019t help but fangirl a little more: \u201cLast time I talked in the forum, I wanted to exaggeratedly boast about you!\u201dChu Yin couldn\u2019t help bending her lips, \u201cYou look good, too.\u201dHan Chuying\u2019s heart melted in an instant.Every time there was a post in the forum, cue Chu Yin, she was the first one who jumped out and yelled, \u201cSister Yin, I can\u201d.Really, she\u2019s wonderful! Ah, ah!Chu Yin thought it was very interesting.Regardless of those people in the previous life, all the people Chu Yin came into contact with in her life who had a very low or almost no sense of existence in the original script were very lovely.Not controlled by the logic of the rubbish script, these people retain their original lovely characters, like Jiang Yan, Song Zhaolin, and this enthusiastic second grader.They were all lovely people.When you get along with these people, you would feel better.But soon, the teacher came, holding a sealed envelope.When the papers were sent out, Chu Yin turned to pass the papers, and Han Chuying whispered, \u201cGood luck!\u201d\u201cYou too!\u201d Chu Yin said with a smileIn the first test of Chinese, the examinees got the test paper and swept through the composition questions and the common questions. Chu Yin\u2019s Chinese was average and not as good as Jiang Yan\u2019s, she found the questions a bit difficult.This seemed to be a signal that the next few subjects would not be easy.Chu Yin stabilized her mind and finished the paper steadily.Two and a half hours later, the classroom was filled with wails.Jiang Yan ran over and held Chu Yin: \u201cIt\u2019s so difficult. I haven\u2019t seen two familiar words in the Classical Chinese Test.\u201dHan Chuying eagerly joined them: \u201cNeither have I!\u201dThese top students were very sympathetic to each other. Several girls soon chatted with each other. Because the test in the morning was too difficult, no one chatted during breaks anymore. Everyone was sitting in their respective seats reading their exercise books/Not only the first examination room but also the other examination rooms.And at this time, the last examination room suddenly boiled\u2014\u2014Lu Zhen! Came to take an exam!\u2014With a pen!The girls in the whole examination room were excited again.Lu Zhen found his position, sat down, and looked at the position in front of him.Remembering Chu Yin sitting in front of him last time, Lu Zhen raised his lips slightly.She would surely be surprised if he gets serious.\u2026\u2026Two days later, the final exam was finally over.Chu Yin said goodbye to Jiang Yan and Han Chuying. As she walked towards the school gate, she saw Song Zhaolin rush out of the school like a wild horse.She watched him for a while. She was in a good mood when she took the car home.No matter what the result is, at least the test was finished!But when she got home, she found that the Chen family finally came to the Chu family today. Chu Qiuqiu came back earlier than her. By this time, she was already in the living room.Chu Yin was very satisfied with her enterprising spirit and planned to sneak back to her room from one side.At this time, she suddenly heard Father Chu\u2019s warm voice: \u201cCome on, Xuanyuan, drink this!\u201dXuanyuan?These two words, which always ranked first in the list of \u201cdomineering boy\u2019s name\u201d, suddenly made Chu Yin recall this old brother.Chen Xuanyuan, a person with a name in the script. He was probably a villain in the script because his style was so vivid that Chu Yin could still remember it now.His boastful style of \u201cwoman, you have attracted my attention\u201d was probably created by the garbage script. It\u2019s ironic that many women fell from his seduction style.In his last life, Chen Xuanyuan showed great interest in Chu Yin, which made Chu Yin suffer.After Chu Yin was trapped by Lu Zhen, this old man continued his seduction until he was suppressed by Lu Zhen.In short, it was a person who Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to contact again.Chu Yin made a quick decision and quietly hid in the living room before going back to her room.Chu Qiuqiu sat next to Chen Xuanyuan. He handed her a glass of juice and said with a magnetic voice, \u201cWould you like a drink, miss?\u201dChu Qiuqiu blushed and said, \u201cThank you, Brother Xuanyuan.\u201d\u201cMy pleasure,\u201d Chen Xuanyuan said with a sweet smile.Although the Chu family daughter in front of him looked a little more ordinary, she was better than the other girls from ordinary families. Since she wanted to be his fianc\u00e9e, he would let her.The elders of the two families looked at this scene and smiled kindly.A perfect match between a man and a girl! The boy was handsome and the girl was lovely. What an ideal couple!Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s performance just now was very decent. Father Chen was quite satisfied with her.Chu Qiuqiu looked at her parents\u2019 expressions again. At this time, they couldn\u2019t remember another daughter. She felt at ease.She had seized this opportunity.Chu Qiuqiu couldn\u2019t help looking at Chen Xuanyuan again. The other party immediately returned a charming look.Her cheeks were burning as she thought, if all goes well, this would be her fiancee.Father Chu praised: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Xuanyuan for several years. I didn\u2019t expect that he would look so handsome now!\u201dChen Xuanyuan\u2019s lips raised and carefully swept his soft hair. He always paid attention to the praise of his appearance.Father Chen was also quite confident about his son\u2019s appearance. He nodded: \u201cXuanyuan\u2019s appearance is really excellent.\u201dSince Chu Yin worked on the exercise book for more than an hour, she was now hungry.\u201cDing \u2013 task completed \u221a [change word] permission has been transferred in your account~\u201dChu Yin put down her pen. She quietly opened the door and wanted to go to the first floor to find something to eat. The conversation in the living room continued, so Chu Yin quietly stuck to the wall and slipped into the kitchen.The Chu family did not support the idea of snacks nor instant foods. Chu Yin looked around and took the steamed bread from the refrigerator.Just at this time, a joking and arrogant voice rang out: \u201cAre you the servant of this family?\u201dChu Yin looked back, caught off guard, and saw Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s face.When Chen Xuanyuan saw her, he was stunned.This woman is too damn beautiful!Chu Yin closed the refrigerator door without expression and nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dChen Xuanyuan stared at her tightly, suddenly remembered that Uncle Chu said that he had two daughters \u2013 this must be another one!Chen Xuanyuan laughed: \u201cNo, you are not.\u201dThe king\u2019s spirit came to his face.\u00a01Chen Xuanyuan came over and looked down at Chu Yin, \u201cYou will be my fiancee, my woman.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026poof.\u201dNothing else.She just suddenly remembered how the man was crying and begging Lu Zhen to let him go.Chen Xuanyuan evilly smiled: \u201cWhy, are you scared?\u201dHe hadn\u2019t returned for a long time, and Father Chen came to look for him. He followed the rest of the people to the kitchen.\u201cXuanyuan? What are you doing in the kitchen?\u201dChu Yin did not answer Chen Xuanyuan. She chose to open the script:\u3010Chen Xuanyuan: \u201cWhat am I doing? Do you understand my heart?\u3011\u3010His unruly hairstyle and contemptuous eyes reveal that he\u2019s determined to win the person in front of him. \u3011\u3010This man is like a noble king.\u3011For this description, Xueji closed the script in shame.This rubbish script will make me go blind!!Previous life disgusts me, this life also disgusts me!Everyone came to the kitchen. Chen Xuanyuan raised his eyebrows and smiled evilly. He was about to utter some amazing lines.Chu Yin grabbed the light pen expressionlessly and added a word to the script.Bye bye.\u3010This man is like a noble bastard.\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go away! (1)To be honest, Chu Yin was so bitter about it that she didn\u2019t know the effects of the word change.She felt excited as she thought about it.As soon as Father Chen walked into the kitchen, he saw his handsome son talking to a little girl. He frowned, \u201cThis is\u2026\u201dFather Chu followed closely. He then remembered his daughter Chu Yin, \u201cOh. This is my daughter.\u201dWith that, he scolded her, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come out to say hello after you got home?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cOh, greetings uncle.\u201dAlthough Father Chen thought that this person was not polite, he realized after a closer look that this girl was clearly more beautiful than the other sister plus her grades were better! \u2014 What\u2019s wrong with Old Chu? Introducing an inferior one to them?He stepped forward and held his son kindly: \u201cXuanyuan, have you just met? This\u2026Even after being held by his father, the son didn\u2019t move.So Father Chen pulled again, Chen Xuanyuan still didn\u2019t move. His lips only showed an evil and dignified smile.Father Chen: ?But Chu Yin understood\u2014\u2014You\u2019re a bastard. A bastard who doesn\u2019t move!Look, this unmoving domineering spirit!Father Chen was a little embarrassed, wondering if his son was stunned by this girl\u2019s appearance.Chu Qiuqiu had also followed behind. Seeing this situation, she bit her lips angrily, feeling very upset. Will Chu Yin steal this man from her?Why did she deliberately choose this kind of solitary space?!At this time, Chen Xuanyuan slowly turned his head, looked at his father, and then suddenly fell.Father Chen was startled: \u201cXuanyuan, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dChen Xuanyuan didn\u2019t answer him and only pushed his hands on the ground, so Chu Yin understood again\u2014oh, he wanted to climb!This bastard is going to crawl and walk!Father Chen was shocked and desperately tried to stop him: \u201cXuanyuan, what\u2019s the matter with you, Xuanyuan!\u201dChen Xuanyuan sneered desperately: \u201cDon\u2019t stop me!\u201dSeeing him like this, talking to him was useless. Father Chen didn\u2019t how his handsome son suddenly became like this?In the end, Father Chen and Father Chu carried Chen Xuanyuan to the car. Both of them were sweating profusely.\u201cOld Chu, we still have things to do today. I\u2019ll see you at the dinner party in two days!\u201dFather Chu understood and said, Go ahead. I\u2019ll see you then.\u201dFather Chen: \u201cThe matter discussed by our two families remains unchanged. I\u2019m very satisfied with the girl just now\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish speaking, Chen Xuanyuan in the car began to crawl under the seat with a sneer on his face.Father Chen wiped the sweat on his face, \u201cThen, we\u2019ll go first!\u201dFather Chu watched them drive away from the villa before returning back.Originally he was worried about Qiuqiu\u2019s sudden dancing. Now it seemed that Old Chen\u2019s son was not normal either\u2026The results of the final exam would be announced once the students return to school.For Huiwen students, returning to school made them excited, especially for the elite class like Class 5.\u201cAh, I just passed by the teacher\u2019s office and heard them say that the average grade score this time is much lower than the mid-term score!\u201d\u201cOf course, the tests are so difficult this time. The overall score is expected to drop!\u201d\u201cDo you think Chu Yin can still place first in the exam?\u201dChu Yin was also looking forward to the results. After all, the final exam was the stepping stone for the next big system task. She could only think about the next step after passing the task.Song Zhaolin was even more nervous than the mid-term one. He sat in his seat with his hands folded: \u201cPass, let me pass, please\u2026\u201dChu Yin knew about Song Zhaolin\u2019s brother\u2019s strength. Her eyebrows were raised as she said: \u201cYou won\u2019t be beaten if you pass?\u201dIt seems that his brother was not so evil.Song Zhaolin shook his head with a detached face: \u201cNo. If I pass, I won\u2019t get beaten from the neck above.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin was silent for a moment, \u201cYou should\u2019ve reviewed early!\u201dSong Zhaolin sobbed: \u201cI reviewed! But the tests are too damn hard! I calculated my average. I might get a score of 89.\u201dThe passing score was 90.Chu Yin sighed.Silly son. This father can\u2019t help you.This time, mathematics was difficult. Chu Yin also felt it while doing the problem. She came across two types of questions she encountered while doing her own high-level training. Simply put, those questions\u2019 difficulty was high. Even she was not sure how to solve them, let alone the other students.However, no matter how worried students were, they need to face the results.The first few classes were the three subjects of comprehensive literature. The papers were directly sent to the students. Chu Yin\u2019s mood was stable as she placed first in geography, second and third in history and politics, and had ranked first in the overall score.\u201cDamn, Chu Yin ranked first again!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so awesome\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s really a top student.\u201dFu Mingxuan originally hoped for Chu Yin to fail, but after hearing her comprehensive results, she stayed quiet.Sometimes, after being crushed so many times, the psychological endure of a person would automatically upgrade.In the following two subjects, Chinese and English, the score pattern in the class had not changed much. Jiang Yan still got the highest score in Chinese, Chu Yin got the full score in English, and Fu Mingxuan got 145.Fu Mingxuan herself was quite satisfied. People around congratulated her: \u201c145 is very high!\u201d\u201cGetting a second place is good!\u201dXing Lan, who sat next to Fu Mingxuan, sighed.She didn\u2019t know when the students in Class 5 started to compete for second place. As long as they got second place, they would already be satisfied.After class, Jiang Yan ran to Chu Yin\u2019s seat: \u201cYin Yin, only math is left. Are you sure about your results?\u201dAlthough Song Zhaolin\u2019s results were miserable, he had super high confidence in Chu Yin\u2019s results: \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she be sure! She\u2019ll get first obviously!\u201dJiang Yan: \u201cIt\u2019s not you who placed first!\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cI can take a loan and gamble that she will get first place.\u201dChu Yin saw that their bickering was quite interesting. She laughed for a while and objectively replied, \u201c80 percent.\u201dAlthough it was indeed difficult, Chu Yin felt that she did her very best.Teacher Wang quickly walked into the classroom with the test papers in her arms. The students in Class 5 were suddenly nervous.Many of them wanted to participate in the Hope Cup. Since this was the second selection for the Hope Cup participants, the students were nervous.Because of nervousness, no one was clamoring about the points first. After they finished the question, they checked the answer themselves before knowing their final results.Song Zhaolin was in a trance.He seemed to have seen the brilliant scene of being beaten by his brother.Chu Yin scored 145 points according to the answers the teacher announced. She got the last question wrong but Chu Yin recalculated, knowing that her answer was not wrong.Song Zhaolin saw the result she had written at the top of the paper. \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cSister Yin, you scored 156?\u201dWhat kind of monster is this!!!He only got half of her score!!Everyone was very concerned about the math results this time. Their ears were on guard and when they heard that Chu Yin had scored a 145, they were all stupefied.Chu Yin wanted to seal Song Zhaolin\u2019s big mouth, \u201dIt\u2019s just my own calculation.\u201dOn the platform, Teacher Wang laughed: \u201cThat\u2019s right! It\u2019s 145. I saw it specially, it\u2019s great. Very good!\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t disappoint her. The difficulty of this math paper was close to the third level of senior high school. The other top students in the class could get 130 at most, but Chu Yin could still get a score of 145, which made Teacher Wang confident in her participation in the competition.There was an uproar in the audience, and everyone turned to look at Chu Yin.Zhao Yuxiong said, \u201cWhy is Chu Yin so brilliant? She\u2019s a goddess.\u201dChapter 31 \u2013 Bastard! Go away! ( 2)Li Jin nodded: \u201cShe\u2019s indeed a goddess.\u201d\u201cThen her slot in the Hope Cup is already decided\u2026\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201dFu Mingxuan looked at her 132 score and thought: Even if she got the quota, would she be crushed by Chu Yin if she goes to the winter camp? It\u2019s better not to go!Jiang Yan ran to Chu Yin as soon as class was over. She got 135, which was better than the mid-term exam. Mathematics was not her strong point originally, Jiang Yan was quite satisfied with this result.Another figure appeared at the back door of Class 5, and whispered, \u201cChu Yin, Chu Yin!\u201dChu Yin turned to see that Han Chuying was at the door.Chu Yin waved with a smile, and Han Chuying ran in happily. Students in Class 5 also knew her. She was in the second grade. Before Chu Yin came, Han Chuying ranked first in total. A top student hanging around a top student?\u201cI heard you scored 145? \u201d Han Chuying said excitedly, \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll go to the Hope Cup!\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyebrows were raised in surprise: \u201cdo you know all about it?\u201dHan Chuying shook her mobile phone: \u201cIt\u2019s been posted in the forum. Since you\u2019re so dazzling, everyone paid great attention.\u201dAfter knowing her for a few days, Chu Yin had learned to automatically filter her endless fangirling. The child is good but she likes to praise people too much.Han Chuying didn\u2019t think she was exaggerating at all and even thought her words were too pale and powerless to match Chu Yin.Since the weather was cold, Chu Yin wore a black cashmere sweater with a high collar over her school uniform. This showed her slender neck and fair skin. Her chin touched her collar, while her soft and brown hair fell on her shoulder.After Han Chuying looked at her, she got excited again. Wuwuwu she is so beautiful! I envy the students in Class 5! I envy her deskmate too!Jiang Yan was not familiar with Han Chuying before. They were only acquaintances before. After knowing her, she found that she was very cheerful and not a dull geek at all.Han Chuying placed her head on Chu Yin\u2019s face for a while, and then she remembered her purpose: \u201cYes, I\u2019m 142. I\u2019ve asked around Class 1 and found no one\u2019s higher than me. How about your class?\u201dJiang Yan shook her head enviously: \u201cI didn\u2019t reach that score yet. I have to pay more attention in class.\u201dHan Chuying was more excited: \u201cThen I can get the slot too!\u201dHan Chuying was so excited that she wanted to jump at the thought that she could go to the winter camp with Chu Yin, her goddess. They could even be assigned in the same dormitory!Chu Yin smiled and thought it would be nice to go with her.As soon as Song Zhaolin came back from a walk, he said, \u201cThen Sister Yin got the first place in Math?\u201dAfter listening to him, Han Chuyin turned on her phone and swiped.Suddenly, she didn\u2019t know what she saw because her expression went blank: \u201cI\u2019m going.\u201dSong Zhaolin immediately smelled melon seeds and quickly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dHan Chuying looked incredulous, \u201c145 is not the number one in mathematics?\u201dEveryone on the scene was surprised: \u201cAh??\u201d\u201cThen who\u2019s the first?\u201dThere was another hermit in the school?!Even Chu Yin was surprised. She raised her eyes and asked, \u201cDid it say who it was?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Han Chuying stammered, \u201cIt\u2019s Lu, Lu Zhen\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c?!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cDing~ Host, your [Placed First in Mathematics] task failed~\u201d\u2014Your mother Lu Zhen!!\u2026\u2026At the same time, the Old Mathematics Teacher in the International Class looked happy.He had been teaching for many years and had a high reputation. The Lu family had invited him before and wanted to hire him to teach Lu Zhen alone, but he refused because he was on the front line\u00a01. Later, he heard that the Lu family had hired a university professor for Lu Zhen, so Teacher Chen always knew that Lu Zhen\u2019s math level was very high.This time he finally took the exam, with a score of 147, which was two points higher than the student in Class 5.What\u2019s more gratifying to Teacher Chen was that Lu Zhen did not exclude the Hope Cup competition and was willing to accept the slot!He was so elated that he drank a large cup of tea.The news of Lu Zhen\u2019s math score of 147 quickly spread throughout the school like a rocket. Forums, Q groups, and WeChat groups were discussing this matter everywhere.Everyone originally thought that even though Lu Zhen was handsome and had a good family background, his grades were not good, and was rather casual with academics.But this time, with such a difficult math test, he actually passed the student who placed first.Liang Yueqi looked at the shocked classmates and said with a smile that she was not surprised at all.\u201cYou just don\u2019t know him. The Lu family had hired teachers to teach Lu Zhen,\u201d Liang Yueqi looked like an insider that was spilling the beans. \u201cHis grades are very good. I always know.\u201dPeople around her sighed. She was really worthy of being a family friend of Lu\u2019s. They seemed to have this kind of friendship.Liang Yueqi felt annoyed in her heart. She knew that Lu Zhen would take the exam and would participate in the competition. She did her best in the math exam and was hoping to get a good result.Lu Zhen himself was the most peaceful.He had an understanding of his level of knowledge and was also sure of the difficulty of the paper. This score was within his estimated range.Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t help passing the classroom of Class 5 and glanced at it.Chu Yin was sitting by the window, looking down at the paper with a serious look.The warm winter sun fell on the top of her hair through the glass. She looked good in a black turtleneck today.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart suddenly softened.Isn\u2019t she a good student\u2026Lu Zhen thought.Does he count as a good student too?Lu Zhen didn\u2019t stay too long. After seeing her, he turned around and returned to his classroom. Song Zhaolin already ran over to Lu Zhen\u2019s classroom and had waited for him.As soon as he saw him, Song Zhaolin began wailing, \u201cBrother Zhen! Awesome! I\u2019m your little fan!\u201dLu Zhen scolded him: \u201cGo away.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cReally! You overtook my deskmate\u2019s score. Too fierce!\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes calmly, \u201cIs your deskmate surprised?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cSurprised!\u201dLu Zhen rubbed his knuckles slightly. His voice was quiet and calm as he said, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201dSong Zhaolin scratched his head: \u201cOh, she said she wanted to kill.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dChapter 31 \u2013 Bastard! Go away! ( 3)Chu Yin failed.This time, she failed the system task of getting first place in Mathematics.Although she still ranked first in total with a score of 704, she lost to the dog man with a score of 147!Ah, ah, ah\u2014\u2014Chu Yin was so angry that she scratched her head.But even if she was angry, Chu Yin didn\u2019t plan to kill him this time.\u2014\u2014What\u2019s more, she didn\u2019t think he would overtake her next time!!However, the Chu parents were quite satisfied with her achievements and praised her at the dinner table.Chu Qiuqiu got sixth place in the exam this time and made progress, but she was completely forgotten by her parents because they found that their daughter gave them more face.Chu Qiuqiu held the fork tightly.\u201cAnother piece of good news,\u201d Father Chu said happily, \u201cTomorrow I\u2019ll take you to a dinner party. Uncle Chen and Mr. Chen, who came to visit that day, will also go. Make good preparations!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYou go.\u201dChu Qiuqiu was very happy.But Father Chu immediately refused: \u201cNo!\u201dThe Chen family made it clear that they wanted to get married, but after Xuanyuan returned home, he made it clear that he liked Chu Yin more. For the benefit of the family, Chu Yin had to socialize even if she hadn\u2019t adapted yet.Chu Yin gave him a cold look.She didn\u2019t understand Father Chu\u2019s thoughts. In his eyes, this was an obligation to be fulfilled as a daughter of the Chu family.But she needed to go to this dinner party. If she won\u2019t, she wouldn\u2019t know what this father of hers would agree behind her back. Her fiancee might be decided immediately by then.\u201cOkay.\u201d Chu Yin said, \u201cI\u2019ll go.\u201dShe could do more damage if she goes.Father Chu and Mother Chu both showed a satisfied and gratified smile, only Chu Qiuqiu lowered her head, hiding her unwillingness.\u2026\u2026The dinner party venue was held in the center of the city. Father Chu took his two daughters to the dinner.He glanced in the rearview mirror and wasn\u2019t satisfied: \u201cXiao Yin, you are dressed too casually, look at Qiuqiu.\u201dChu Qiuqiu dressed up very carefully. Her evening dress looked very suitable for her. Meanwhile, Chu Yin\u2019s skirt was very simple. It was a warm-knitted style.Father Chu sighed in his heart. As expected, the daughter he raised since young had better taste than the daughter he hadn\u2019t raised.After entering the banquet hall, he met many rich and famous people. Father Chu quickly stepped forward and began to socialize.Chu Qiuqiu glanced at Chu Yin and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cSister, you are not suitable for this kind of occasion.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dIt\u2019s been a long time since she participated in this kind of social event.Chu Yin looked around, suddenly caught a glimpse of Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s figure, and immediately went away, leaving him to Chu Qiuqiu.Chen Xuanyuan came over, Chu Qiuqiu looked at him with a flushed face and big eyes: \u201cBrother Xuanyuan\u2026\u201dChen Xuanyuan casually nodded then searched around for Chu Yin\u2019s figure.Although he didn\u2019t want to admit it, the woman was so beautiful that he was haunted by her beauty.How could he fall in love?Chu Qiuqiu saw that he was absent-minded. She bit his lips and said, \u201cBrother Xuanyuan, my sister originally came from the countryside.\u201dChen Xuanyuan raised one eyebrow: \u201cOh?\u201dChu Qiuqiu: \u201cShe\u2019s been raised in the countryside for more than ten years. She can\u2019t compare with the ordinary rich ladies. Her education and her fashion sense in clothes are not good. My parents are also very worried\u2026\u201dChen Xuanyuan said with a smile: \u201cIt turns out that a person like her is still interesting.\u201d-Oh, that woman\u2026she, was feeling inferior when they met?No wonder she was too indifferent with him!Her coldness was just her protective color!Chen Xuanyuan glanced around and finally found Chu Yin in the corner. He raised a charming smile and strode toward her.On the second floor of the hall, two people stood on the balcony, each holding a glass of wine.Lu Linyuan looked at the banquet underneath and said with a smile, \u201cWhy did Ah Zhen begin to pay attention to this kind of occasion?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s gaze fell on a certain point. He casually said, \u201cIt\u2019s just boring.\u201dHe heard she was coming to this party, so he came to have a look.Is she still angry?\u00a0Lu Zhen thought silently.Lu Linyuan followed his eyes to find the object he was looking at. Because Lu Zhen quickly looked away, Lu Linyuan couldn\u2019t find what it was. He laughed, \u201cAre you classmates with one of the daughters of the Chu family?\u201dLu Zhen sipped the wine: \u201cYeah.\u201dLu Linyuan said leisurely, \u201cIt\u2019s said that today\u2019s dinner is intended to bring together the Chu family and the Chen family. They have plans to get married. However, they are just small families. You don\u2019t have to worry about them.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s face suddenly sank.Lu Linyuan\u2019s eyebrows slightly raised: \u201cHmm?\u201dLu Zhen saw Chen Xuanyuan coming near Chu Yin. He didn\u2019t know what they were talking about.So it was Chu Yin who would be married to the Chen family?Lu Zhen\u2019s expression became a little cold as his pupils turned dark. He suppressed his emotions and said coldly, \u201cNothing. The wine is too bad.\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin gave space for Chu Qiuqiu and Chen Xuanyuan to develop, but the development did not seem as good as she expected.The confident king came to her again.\u201cOriginally, you acted so indifferently to me because of your inferiority!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026??\u201dHow did you even conclude that?Chu Yin planned to open the script in case of emergency.Chen Xuanyuan laughed wildly: \u201cI know you came from the countryside. With me, I can give you everything you can\u2019t imagine!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYour parents are very satisfied with me. I can see it. Even if you hide your feelings for me, I can see it,\u201d Chen Xuanyuan said with a devilish smile. \u201cWoman, you can\u2019t escape from me!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cOh.\u201d\u2014Can someone help me!!Chu Yin was nauseated as she realized that he was determined to marry her. She had to do something.\u201cA friendly prompt from the system! The special item [ replacement card ] in host\u2019s account is about to expire~\u201dChu Yin: \u201cThis thing has a shelf life?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhat is the specific usage of the replacement card?\u201d\u201cReplacement Card\u201d can only be used against a single character. One word or word can be replaced by another word or word from the script content of the character. \u201cChu Yin understood in seconds\u2013 this isn\u2019t a word replacement function?Chen Xuanyuan condescendingly looked at her, \u201cAre you excited?\u201dChu Yin originally hesitated at first, but she immediately made up her mind when she heard him say this.\u201cUse replacement card.\u201d Chu Yin said.She thought that if Chen Xuanyuan had a mental problem, the chance of this marriage being successful was low.Chu Yin looked at the script, which was full of Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s cool lines.How to maximize the function of the replacement card? Of course, it was to replace the most frequent words in the script.Chu Yin said to the system, \u201csaid\u201d \u201cto \u201cshouted\u201dXueji: \u201cAmazing! Truly an artist.\u201dAs soon as the voice fell, the script was replaced in seconds.At this moment, Chu Qiuqiu just came over and held Chen Xuanyuan softly and weakly: \u201cBrother Xuanyuan, dad called us over.\u201dChen Xuanyuan turned his head, opened his mouth, and suddenly yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go!!\u201dChu Qiuqiu was caught off guard and shivered unexpectedly.Even Chu Yin was so shocked that she stepped back two steps!Father Chen heard the commotion and came quickly: \u201cXuanyuan, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201dAs soon as Chen Xuanyuan turned around, he shouted, \u201cI\u2019m okay! I don\u2019t want to do that either!\u201d\u201cShit! What\u2019s going on!\u201dFather Chen was extremely concerned that his heart disease was about to relapse.Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s voice shocked the whole banquet hall. This was an elegant and powerful social occasion. No one had ever been so impolite. Everyone looked at him with strange eyes.Chen Xuanyuan panicked and continued to shout: \u201cDamn it! God! My god! What\u2019s wrong with me!\u201dFather Chen said, \u201cCalm down! Xuanyuan, calm down!\u201dChen Xuanyuan collapsed as he shouted, \u201cI\u2019m calm!\u201dFather Chen collapsed with him, \u201cYou\u2019re not calm.\u201dAt this moment, Chen Xuanyuan was stopped behind with a cold voice: \u201c\u2014\u2014Hey.\u201dAfter Father Chen recognized the man, he looked frightened. He quickly tried to hold his son: \u201cDon\u2019t shout.\u201dBut when Chen Xuanyuan turned his head, he shouted, \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201dThe whole banquet hall fell in silence.Lu Zhen looked at him and said expressionlessly, \u201cAre you a human trumpet?\u201d\u201cGet out.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go! (1)Father Chen looked desperate.This was Lu Zhen, the young master of the Lu family!!It\u2019s fine for his father to be yelled at by his son, but he was forbidden to yell at Lu Zhen!!!Father Chen hurriedly said, \u201cWell, Master Lu, Xuanyuan, he\u2013\u201c\u201cI\u2019m not a trumpeter!\u201d Chen Xuanyuan shouted.Father Chen almost swore at him: Shut the hell up!!When he was told by Lu Zhen to go away, he felt ashamed. Chen Xuanyuan knew that the Lu family was not something their family could afford to fight.He said it calmly! Very calm! But his mouth couldn\u2019t stop shouting! There seemed to be a great force in his body!This was a great crisis for an elegant noble boy with infinite charms as him!\u201cMy god, that\u2019s the son of the Chen family\u2026\u201d\u201cHe doesn\u2019t look quite normal?\u201dLu Zhen looked at Chen Xuanyuan expressionlessly.He originally felt a huge irritation in his heart but when he saw that Chu Yin unconsciously stepped back, as if afraid of getting involved in any relationship with this man, his irritation dispersed.Hide well. The farther the better.Father Chen said to Lu Zhen in a panic, \u201cMaster Lu, I\u2019m really sorry. Xuanyuan didn\u2019t mean it!\u201dAt this time, Chen Xuanyuan finally learned to be smart. He closed his mouth and tried to calm himself down.But Father Chen didn\u2019t understand his spirit, so he yanked his son: \u201cGo apologize to Master Lu!\u201dChen Xuanyuan blurted out subconsciously: \u201cSORRY!\u201dHe wanted to make a good apology, but when he opened his mouth, he shouted again!Father Chen: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dFew minutes later, the Chen family and his son were invited out of the banquet hall.The people in the banquet could still hear Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s desperate shouts even from far away.\u201cI can\u2019t control my voice!!\u201dThe atmosphere of the party fell into awkwardness for a moment.\u201cInsane\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a mental problem. Will the Chu family still marry the Chen family?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the daughter of the Chu family too miserable then?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t only the Chen family who was ashamed, but also Father Chu. After all, many people knew about the marriage they were planning with the Chen\u2019s.Father Chen couldn\u2019t help but mutter in his breath. Combined with Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s performance at home last time, the son of the Chen family could really be sick\u2026But even if he was ill, should he give up the marriage between the two families? A disease could be cured but the cooperation within the economic market couldn\u2019t.While Father Chu was in\u00a0 a dilemma, Chu Qiuqiu suddenly came over: \u201cDad, I don\u2019t care!\u201dAlthough Chu Qiuqiu was shocked just now, she realized that this was her chance. At this time, whoever made the statement could seize the opportunity!She wisely said: \u201cAs long as it can help the family, I am willing to tolerate Brother Xuanyuan\u2019s small problems.\u201dHearing her say this, Father Chu was moved, \u201cQiuqiu!\u201dAs expected of the daughter he raised. So knowledgeable! Compared with Chu Yin, Chu Qiuqiu was indeed more suitable for this role!On the other side, Chu Yin listened to their conversation quietly, and a big stone in her heart was put down.\u2014\u2014Thank you. This fake sister is really a tough character.However, Chu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t marry the Chen family in the end. After the Chu family went bankrupt, the marriage of the two was also dissolved. Chu Qiuqiu was afraid of carrying the Chu family\u2019s debts that she immediately turned to the wealthy princes who she befriended in the social circle for many years.From this point of view, Chu Qiuqiu was more far-sighted than her parents.If she remembered correctly, Chu Qiuqiu ended up marrying into a wealthy family and had two children. Although Lu Zhen used this to stimulate her at that time, Chu Yin\u2019s mood didn\u2019t fluctuate at all.Recalling the past, Chu Yin suddenly remembered that she still didn\u2019t know why the dog man, Lu Zhen, came here today.Chen Xuanyuan was pretty cool when he shouted just now. Chu Yin was envious of his imposing manner. He wanted to transmigrate as Chen Xuanyuan and yell at the dog man herself.The only thing that worried her was Lu Zhen. Since he had noticed something before, would he connect the dots from today\u2019s event? But when she thought about it, Lu Zhen and Chen Xuanyuan were two different people who had nothing to do with each other in this life. If a person suddenly encountered a mentally-disable person like Chen Xuanyuan, a person\u2019s first reaction should be like what Lu Zhen did just now\u2013telling him to get out.While Chu Yin was pondering, a refined voice suddenly sounded from behind: \u201cLittle classmate.\u201dAs soon as Chu Yin looked back, she recognized Lu Zhen\u2019s uncle, Lu Linyuan. She didn\u2019t expect to meet him here.In her last life, Chu Yin had a chance to meet this man before she entered the Lu family. It was said that Lu Linyuan was in charge of the gray industry of the Lu family. He was elegant and highly cultivated. Chu Yin had a good impression of this uncle after two short contacts with him.\u201cHello, can I help you?\u201d Chu Yin asked.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Lu Linyuan said with a smile. \u201cI saw you standing near the commotion. Were you surprised?\u201dThis made Chu Yin a little embarrassed.Not only was she not frightened, but also she watched with relish.Chu Yin was embarrassed. When she thought about her evil deed of changing the car speed to 180mph, she suddenly felt guilty again.She remembered that Lu Linyuan was also in the car.She smiled politely: \u201cNo, I dodged.\u201dLu Linyuan laughed as his eyes fell on Chu Yin\u2019s face. He was about to ask something when he was interrupted by a cold voice: \u201cUncle.\u201dAs soon as Chu Yin looked back, she saw Lu Zhen standing not far away with a cold look.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d When he said this, Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes didn\u2019t shift to Chu Yin, as if he didn\u2019t notice her.Lu Linyuan raised his eyebrows and then said with a smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t this your classmate? I just want to talk to her.\u201dChu Yin was calm.\u201cThis is not my classmate.\u201d Lu Zhen said coldly, \u201cThe other sister.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d Lu Linyuan laughed and turned to look at Chu Yin: \u201cI admit my mistake. It\u2019s a pleasure to talk with you, little classmate. I hope I have the chance to see you again.\u201dChu Yin gave a polite smile.Lu Zhen soon walked side by side with Lu Linyuan. Before turning around, Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes stayed on Chu Yin for a second, and his dark pupil seemed to have some deep thoughts.But obviously, Chu Yin wouldn\u2019t get it and just felt that the dog man was weird tonight.Both the uncle and the nephew were mysterious\u2026On the other side, Chu Qiuqiu achieved her goal. She happily turned to Chu Yin, glanced at the two Lu family members who were walking away, and said, \u201cSister, did you talk to them just now?\u201dChapter 32 \u2013 Cheating! Go! (2)Chu Yin, because she helped recycle Chen Xuanyuan, was particularly pleased to see Chu Qiuqiu now, \u201cOh, that\u2019s right~\u201dChu Qiuqiu advised her: \u201cBe practical. If you aim so high up, others will talk about you.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dExcuse me, she still can\u2019t communicate with the trash normally.Huiwen\u2019s official website finally announced the list of participants for the Hope Cup Winter Camp.Three people got the slots. The order of the list was as follows: Second-Year International Class, Lu Zhen. Second-Year Class 5, Chu Yin. Second-year Class 1, Han Chuying.As soon as the public web page came out, the page soon had thousands of clicks. The URL link was posted in the forum. The post soon became hot.Anonymous 13: Ah, why didn\u2019t I work hard at math! If I did, I can go to the winter camp with Brother Zhen!!!Anonymous 20: No, I don\u2019t think Lu Zhen will go. He only took the exam because he felt like it.Anonymous 22: @14, Even if you study hard, you wouldn\u2019t be able to go hahaha\u2026\u2026Anonymous 30: Ah, why didn\u2019t I study hard at math! If I did, I can go to the winter camp with Chu Yin!!Anonymous 34: Turns out you\u2019re also a fan?Anonymous 40: @30 and @34, Me too heheheThis time, Han Chuying rarely didn\u2019t participate in the thread to fangirl Chu Yin, but she held her mobile phone as she giggled.She was afraid that once she replied, she would show her extremely arrogant side, \u201cHahaha, I can go to the winter camp with Chu Yin!\u201dGod, she was so happy!She was already considering what new style of pajamas she wanted to buy!On the other side, after reading the announcement on the official website, Chu Yin closed her laptop angrily.\u2014\u2014She wanted to remember this kind of feeling. Be aggressive and violent towards Lu Zhen!!!Although Chu Yin was a top student, Mathematics was not her best subject. She had no experience in math competitions. Now that she got her slot, she couldn\u2019t guarantee her results. She would surely face top students from various provinces and cities. Of course, the competitiveness would be much greater than in Huiwen.However, Chu Yin\u2019s interest and fighting spirit were still very high because she hadn\u2019t received high-level permission for word change.Chu Shi knew she received the slot. The location of the winter camp was in B province, and Chu Yin had to go there by plane. He was very worried.Although his sister was independent and excellent, she grew up in the countryside after all. She hadn\u2019t traveled far away yet. This made him worried.But Chu Yin refused his suggestion to accompany her on the plane. She even said that it was better to buy her more sets of questions than use the money to buy an airplane ticket.Unable to vent his anger, the brother had no choice but to buy some exercise books for Chu Yin.Before Chu Yin set out, she drowned herself in math problems every day.A few days later, Chu Yin finally caught a description of her in the script.\u3010For the upcoming winter camp, Chu Yin was doing exercises every day. Her logical thinking ability was not very good, so she practiced diligently. As the exercise books were filled up one by one, her math skills continued to improve. \u2026Finally, it\u2019s time to leave for B province.\u3011\u2014\u2014Here we go! Here we go! Logical thinking ability was more important than memory!This time Chu Yin would never be soft again!Give! Herself! Extreme! Buff!Chu Yin changed the word \u201cnot very good\u201d to \u201cvital\u201dHer logical thinking ability should not be too good!!After cheating by adding bluffs, Chu Yin looked at the hardest question and felt that her thinking was extremely clear. The questions were fun! Her waist and legs no longer hurt.As a result, the speed of her problem-solving soared, as if she was eating a book.Two days later, Chu Shi came to see her and cleaned up her brown hair strands that were sprawled on the desk. With a solemn expression, he said: \u201cYin Yin, I think you exerted your brain too much?\u201dChu Yin raised her bright eyes from the book and showed a mysterious smile.\u201cI\u2019m bald, and I\u2019m stronger.\u201d\u2026\u2026When the day finally came, her brother made her bring a hair-growth product that was placed in her luggage.She was not bald. Her hair was very good, but her brother was just too worried.Chu Shi took her to the airport and watched her go to the security check. He felt melancholy. It\u2019s as if he was marrying off his daughter. Fortunately, Gu Qiuze would go to B province to take care of his sister in two days.Chu Yin turned her head at the entrance, waved to Chu Shi, and then went in with her bag on her back.It was a short journey of two hours. Chu Yin arrived after a short sleep on the plane.Han Chuying sent her a WeChat message, saying that she arrived early so she could choose their beds in the dormitory.There was excitement between the lines in her words: [Waiting for you!!!!] [I can\u2019t wait to make the bed for you!!] [Come early!!!]Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help laughing. She was in a good mood.According to the script, the dog man Lu Zhen didn\u2019t move much these days. She didn\u2019t know whether he would participate or not.She missed the system\u2019s reward because of the final exam. She would\u2019ve been given the right to change sentences. There was no need to be afraid. She could directly let Lu Zhen [eat at home and miss the winter camp for ten days.]Chu Yin got off the plane, got her luggage, and took a taxi by the side of the road.Hope Cup Winter Camp was located in the B province\u2019s university. Looking at the pictures sent by Han Chuying, the conditions were not bad. After all, Chu Yin used to go to school in the countryside and lived in a dormitory with eight people for a long time. This kind of dormitory with four people going to bed and getting off the table was completely acceptable to her.After getting out of the taxi, Chu Yin took her luggage and walked into the gate of H University. She saw the banner drawn by the school: \u201cWelcome students from all provinces to the 20th \u2018Hope Cup\u2019 Winter Camp!\u201dChu Yin walked forward and soon saw the location to sign in.As soon as she came, the student immediately poked the person beside her: \u201cLook!\u201dThe man on the side looked up and almost couldn\u2019t breathe, \u201c!!!\u2019A pure and tender high school student walked towards him. Oh my god!!!When Chu Yin came to them, the two students\u2019 eyes were bright and their faces were red with excitement: \u201cSister, are you participating in the winter camp? What\u2019s your name? Which school?\u201d\u201cChu Yin,\u201d she said with a smile. There was a slight tilt of her head, \u201cHuiwen Private High School.\u201dThe hearts of the two students beat wildly, thinking that the younger sister looked so pure and beautiful!\u201cYour dormitory bed has been filled in. This is your key.\u201d\u00a0 The student blushed as she handed her the things. \u201cThere is also this bag, which contains the campus map, flow sheet, and introduction book. Keep your gadgets away~\u201dChu Yin nodded with a smile: \u201cThank you, sister.\u201dWhen she turned around and walked toward the dormitory building according to the map, the students immediately began to chat.\u201cThis is the sister whose ID photo is so beautiful!\u201d\u201cI thought it was edited but I didn\u2019t expect her to be more beautiful!!\u201d\u201cMe too!! If I can\u2019t help it!\u201d\u201cAh, what should I do? Suddenly I\u2019m looking forward to the brother who looks so handsome in his ID card!\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t go far when she heard this sentence.\u201cYes! He\u2019s too handsome!!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the younger students these days? They are too beautiful!\u201d\u201cI expect both of them to cause a campus explosion!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe poked the system: \u201cThis handsome brother, how likely will it be Lu Zhen that dog man?\u201dXueji said objectively, \u201cAbout 99%.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe looked down at the flow chart in her hand. On the third day, according to the flow chart, there would be a level exam.Xueji: \u201cDing! A new system task!~ [Get in the Top 5 in the level test]. This has a difficulty index of 4 stars. You will receive [Change Sentence] permission after the task is completed~\u201dShe failed the final exam task once. But now, she would never let it happen again.Chu Yin\u2019s smile gradually became abnormal.Come on, Dog man.I\u2019ll screw you if you come.Hehehe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yours is located by the window! Hehe!\u201d\u201cWhen I was sweeping the floor just now, I also cleaned your area by the way. You can just put your things directly!\u201dIt was so intimate that Chu Yin was embarrassed.She felt she needed to give something back so she opened her backpack and looked for a gift.Finally, she took out a bottle of shampoo.\u201cThis,\u201d Chu Yin said sheepishly, pursing her lips, \u201cDo you want it?\u201dHan Chuying was almost out of breath\u2014\u2014Big beauty gave her a gift!!! Whatever the gift was, she would love it!!!\u201cYes! Yes!!\u201d Han Chuying immediately took over, \u201cI\u2019ll make good use of it!\u201dThen she looked down and saw the handwriting on the bottle: \u201cWow, this brand of hair tonic works very well!\u201dChu Yin was a little surprised: \u201cDo you have the same hair problem?\u201d\u201cAs a person who studies hard, how can I not be bald! Every one of my hairs has a name.\u201d Han Chuying said. Suddenly she remembered something and looked up nervously, \u201cAh, you don\u2019t have this kind of hair problem, do you?\u201dChu Yin grinned cunningly: \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that people who study hard can\u2019t be bald. I work hard, too.\u201d\u201cBut you can\u2019t be bald!\u201d \u2014\u2014Mom\u00a01\u00a0doesn\u2019t allow it!!!Chu Yin\u2019s face, even if she was bald, could still be beautiful like a little nun. But her brown hair is so beautiful, how could she be bald!Finally, Han Chuying nervously looked at Chu Yin\u2019s hairline. After determining that she had no signs of baldness, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.Because she was not in school, Chu Yin did not wear Huiwen\u2019s loose school uniform.Han Chuying thought that Chu Yin\u2019s clothes were not very good. After all, she had heard that although Chu Yin was the daughter of the Chu family, she had lived in the countryside. And since Chu Yin transferred to another school, except for seeing her wearing a black dress at the dance, she had always been in a school uniform. Han Chuying always felt sorry.But now, Chu Yin had no bad clothes at all!After taking off the thick coat, she was wearing a dark color sweater with a floral shirt inside. The collar of the shirt stretched out from the round collar of the sweater. She wore slim jeans and white boots.She was radiating with beauty.Chu Yin cleaned up the dormitory. After she put her things back, Han Chuying handed her a stack of paper: \u201cHow about you take a look\u00a02\u00a0this?\u201dChu Yin said, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you know about the sample questions of the winter camp in the past, so I\u2019ll give you an extra copy.\u201dChu Yin was surprised again.Winter Camp was only about classes, training, and examinations. Everyone who participated in this camp is competitive. But Han Chuying did not seem to care about these. Although these questions were valuable, she chose to give them to her.Seeing her surprised look, Han Chuying waved her hand: \u201cI\u2019m just like this. When I see you, my beautiful sister with good character, I want to be nice to you. And I know I can\u2019t win the cup of hope, so I just want to have fun and play.\u201dHan Chuying had a good attitude. She was very smart and had enough time to fangirl Chu Yun. Moreover, with her achievements, she could be admitted to a good university in China. Her only focus in this Hope Cup was participation.After hearing this, Chu Yin liked her more and more.\u201cWell, just tell me if you have anything I can do for you.\u201d Chu Yin laughed.Han Chuying smirked: Just keep being beautiful!!!The welcome party and study course would not start until tomorrow. Chu Yin glanced at the dormitory and found that another bed had been made.Han Chuying had been staring at Chu Yin\u2019s face. Before Chu Yin could ask, she replied, \u201cOh, this bed is from the provincial experimental middle school. We spent an hour in the dormitory while exchanging a few words. After she finished packing, she went to the library with the questions.\u201dChu Yin suddenly felt a sense of tension.There were indeed many strong people here, and everyone was working hard. It seemed that she couldn\u2019t relax. After all, she had to get to the top five in the proficiency test the day after tomorrow.Chu Yin didn\u2019t care about her roommates very much. After all, they would only be together for ten days.Even if there was anything discordant in their living habits, mutual tolerance would pass.Just as she was thinking about it, a new roommate came into the dormitory.As soon as Chu Yin looked up and saw her face, she couldn\u2019t help but be stunned.\u201cAre you Liang Yueqi from the international class? Why are you here?\u201d Han Chuying looked surprised.Liang Yueqi scanned Chu Yin\u2019s face with a smile, her expression was a bit arrogant: \u201cMy family heard that Lu Zhen came to participate in the competition, so they helped me arrange it for us to study and progress together.\u201dThe subtext was that she didn\u2019t need the slot given by the school at all, and she came with Lu Zhen.Han Chuying murmured in her heart: Liang Yueqi was only good at English. She can\u2019t even pass Chu Qiuqiu in the math exam. Isn\u2019t it humiliating to come here?When Chu Yin saw Liang Yueqi, she was not in a good mood, because her appearance meant that Lu Zhen, the dog man, really came.But now Chu Yin was not afraid of him. The plot had deviated so much that it was going according to the original development route.Studying was the only priority that would give her the ability to control the script and make her stronger.Chu Yin looked at Liang Yueqi and said, \u201cCome on.\u201dIt\u2019s also an admirable spirit to pursue men here.Liang Yueqi smiled, not making any sound.In essence, she still believed what her grandfather said to her \u2013 there was no need to treat Chu Yin as an opponent. But the winter camp was so long that she was not sure. The main purpose of this visit was to cultivate feelings with Lu Zhen and to improve herself.Liang Yueqzi looked at the four-person dormitory with disgust on her face and reluctantly put her luxury bag on the empty table.Han Chuying looked at her and gave up her plan to make a good relationship. Liang Yueqi was also very good-looking, but it\u2019s far from Chu Yin.Han Chuying just looked at Chu Yin.Chu Yin sat in front of the desk, roughly turning over the questions Han Chuying gave her. She casually did two questions and found that they were very flexible and logical. Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help but drown in the problems again. With a pen on her hand, her brain was currently flying.After a while, Han Chuying called her: \u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean for you to do it now. Aren\u2019t you hungry?\u201dChu Yin remembered that they hadn\u2019t had dinner yet.The organizer of the winter camp gave everyone a student card, which was filled with money for ten days to eat in the school canteen.\u201cIt\u2019s said that the canteen of H University is very good. Let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go!\u201d Han Chuying pushed Chu Yin. Upon seeing Liang Yueqi again, she\u00a0 asked: \u201cClassmate Liang, do you want to go together?\u201dLiang Yueqi said in disgust, \u201cNo, the housekeeper will deliver dinner to me later.\u201d\u201cOh \u2013\u201cChu Yin and Han Chuying stopped caring about her and turned to go downstairs.Just down the stairs, they met several excited high school girls.\u201cHow handsome.\u201d\u201cIs he participating in our winter camp?\u201d\u201cAh, I\u2019m going crazy. I hear he\u2019s a young master in the next city!\u201d\u201cNo wonder he looks so rich!\u201dChu Yin\u2019s step stopped. Han Chuying asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s\u00a0 the matter?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dThe dog man came early.Under the tree opposite the dormitory, the young man with black hair stood still.Han Chuying was not interested in men. She only liked her beautiful sister, so she didn\u2019t spare a glance. Chu Yin also didn\u2019t look. They went to the canteen in silence.Lu Zhen saw Chu Yin the moment she came out of the dormitory.She didn\u2019t wear a school uniform today. She was dressed neatly, which was different from the clever and silent student in his impression. She was still beautiful.Although it was the winter vacation, there were still many students stranded on the university campus. The boys who saw Chu Yin were surprised. They wanted to come up and talk to her.Lu Zhen frowned, his eyes turning dark. He became impatient.He helplessly looked at Chu Yin who didn\u2019t even l spare him a glance.Recently, the young master of the Lu family had been sneaking out by himself just to stay outside the Chu\u2019s villa for a while. Although he had been wandering outside, he hadn\u2019t seen her even once.She was probably studying hard at home.Lu Zhen also knew that she didn\u2019t want to communicate with him but he couldn\u2019t help it. It\u2019s been days that he wanted to talk to her.Seeing that Chu Yin was about to go far away, Lu Zhen sighed helplessly and caught up with her: \u201cChu Yin \u2013\u201cChapter 33 \u2013 Fate and Destined (2)The voice was clear.Han Chuying stopped, looked surprisingly at Chu Yin: \u201cDo you know the school\u2019s apollo?\u201dAh, but it\u2019s normal. After all, Chu Yin was also a school\u2019s flower.Chu Yin was helpless. She didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with Lu Zhen in front of her classmates, so she had to say to Han Chuying, \u201cWait for me? I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d\u201cGo ahead, go ahead ~\u201d Of course, Han Chuying didn\u2019t want to interfere in other people\u2019s social life.But if it\u2019s someone else, they would probably take the initiative to talk to the school\u2019s apollo, but Han Chuying won\u2019t.\u2026\u2026Lu Zhen realized that when Chu Yin turned and walked towards him, his heart suddenly trembled.Chu Yin came up to him and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Zhen looked down at her and pinched his fingers gently. \u201cNothing. Why didn\u2019t\u00a0 you come and say hello to me?\u201dChu Yin sighed in the bottom of her heart. Lu Zhen still loved to say hello in this life. Was he so polite?Lu Zhen saw her suspicious eyes and gave a disguised smile: \u201cI only know you here. May I ask that you take care of me, good student?\u201dAfter hearing this, Chu Yin said, \u201cBut you have good learning skills.\u201dAlthough she was controlling her tone, it still sounded a little sour.Well, she\u2019s just a little sour. The dog man was higher than her. He was higher than her by two points!!!Lu Zhen was very concerned about her emotions. His lips turned upwards, \u201cThere were problems I didn\u2019t know. It was a blind choice.\u201dChu Yin raised her eyes in surprise.Lu Zhen\u2019s pupil was pitch black. He said with a little smile: \u201cSo I\u2019m lucky.\u201dChu Yin thought for half a second: \u201cThat means I\u2019m stronger than you?\u201dLu Zhen couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed.He seemed to have finally found a matter she cared about.It was good to be her opponent, at least she would look at him.Chu Yin was upset: \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s vision fell on her face, with a gentleness and carefulness she didn\u2019t know about.\u201cWell, at how good you are.\u201d\u2026\u2026In the canteen, Chu Yin swiped her student card and bought a curry pork chop rice. Together with Han Chuying, she found a seat and sat down.After the scene just now, many people attending the winter camp in the canteen were secretly watching Chu Yin.Han Chuying bought a big bowl of Malatang, and asked: \u201cSo what did you talk about? Is the school\u2019s apollo courting you?\u201dJust now many girls were watching. They all said that this scene was like an idol drama. It was beautiful.\u201cNo,\u201d she quickly clarified, \u201ctalked about studies.\u201dLu Zhen, the dog man, seemed to have fallen in love with learning in this life. Just now, he told her that he also wanted to be shortlisted in the hope cup. He wanted to study hard and hoped that they would help each other.\u2014\u2014Crazy! Who would help him!He\u2019s a competitor! We have a blood feud, OK!However, she knew that Lu family had always attached great importance to academics. In addition to these basic subjects, he would also take courses in economics and other subjects. With this wide range of knowledge, Lu Zhen\u2019s IQ was obviously high.Because Lu Zhen wanted to fight against her in the battle of mathematics, Chu Yin was suddenly looking forward to it.Screw him, screw him, screw him!I\u2019ll put him under my feet!!On the other side, Han Chuying looked at Chu Yin\u2019s eager eyes. She couldn\u2019t help feeling agitated again.Oh! Her beauty mesmerizes me!I\u2019m hit again! Ah!\u2013The next day, the host of the winter camp held a welcome meeting in the lecture hall of the complex building.After participants spent the night in the dormitory, they had a certain understanding of each other. In addition to Chu Yin and Lu Zhen, the most eye-catching campers, there were top gods from various schools.\u201cI\u2019ve inquired,\u201d Han Chuying whispered. \u201cSomeone in the experimental middle school won last year\u2019s bronze medal, and then there are two big men in other provinces who won championships from other competitions.\u201dRoughly speaking, there were many capable people.Liang Yueqi was very embarrassed to be included in this group of people.She\u2019s really average in math.Yesterday, while Chu Yin and others went to dinner, Liang Yueqi took a look at the paper on Chu Yin\u2019s desk \u2013 she didn\u2019t understand it at all.Chu Yin was also a little nervous.Last night, she slept a little early. If Liang Yuequ didn\u2019t complain about the sound of her pages turning, Chu Yin would have studied more.The teacher who stood on the platform, announced:\u201cWe are here for the common purpose of self-improvement. We will try our best to meet your needs so that you can rest assured of your studies\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition, we have invited outstanding senior students from previous years to help you progress\u2026 \u201cChu Yin and Han Chuying sat together. They were divided in groups.Lu Zhen finally entered the classroom. Chu Yin\u2019s group was full and was filled with boys.His eyebrows folded.\u201cLu Zhen, here ~\u201d Liang Yueqi suddenly made a sound. There was an extra seat beside her.Many girls paid attention to Lu Zhen. Liang Yueqi\u2019s greeting had a hint of sovereignty. People didn\u2019t pay much attention to her at first, so when they noticed her, they looked at her one after another.Lu Zhen was lazy and went directly to the group of Liang Yueqi. He ignored her invitation and took a different seat in the group.Chu Yin saw it silently, and cried out in her heart: Liang Yueqi, go on! Go! Don\u2019t be discouraged! Take him!!This was a training course. Its main purpose was to evaluate the students\u2019 math skills. There were a lot of figures on the papers, regular questions, application questions, and magic squares.Han Chuying said: \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to look at\u2026\u201dThis was the first time that competitors sat together. They were already competing with each other, and no one wanted to be at a disadvantage.The boy opposite to Chu Yin got the paper, picked up the pen, and began to answer. The tip of the pen swished across the paper, which made people feel more pressure.\u2014\u2014Powerful competitor!Chu Yin said to her heart. She spread out the papers, read the questions silently, and answered them smoothly.The results of her rigid training showed at this time. Her upgraded logic thinking also helped her solve math problems. At this moment, Chu Yin suddenly realized her progress very clearly.The sense of fullness and satisfaction filled her heart and made her more motivated.The big guy on the opposite side gradually found that the girl on the opposite side was no less inferior to him! He suddenly felt pressure, looked up and found that the other party had already exceeded him!He immediately buried his head again and quickly started to do it.The last magic square was very complicated. Han Chuying was suffering mentaly. In the end, she wanted to give up.But as soon as she looked up, she saw Chu Yin and the male student in front of her were working hard, so\u00a0 she didn\u2019t want to give up.Although Han Chuying was not top-notch here, she had a good foundation and could grasp the degree of difficulty. It was estimated that no one could solve a problem of this degree.Sure enough, five minutes later, the male student put down his pen.Han Chuyin took a look, he didn\u2019t fill in the magic squares question. As she expected.Beside her, Chu Yin had not given up. Han Chuying held her cheek with one hand and appreciated the beauty\u2019s serious attitude.A girl who does not admit defeat is so lovely!Two minutes later, Chu Yun put down her pen.Just then, the patrol teacher in the classroom asked with a smile: \u201cAre you all stuck in the last odd magic square? Has anyone done it?\u201dThere was a hum of lament in the classroom.But Chu Yin whispered: \u201c1832 from top to bottom on the left, 1693 from top to bottom on the right\u2026\u201dHan Chuying was surprised: \u201cDid you do it?\u201dThe male student on the opposite side also raised his head abruptly.Han Chuying found that the answer was right.\u201cMy God, Yin Yin, you are so awesome!\u201dChu Yin\u2019s expression was ambiguous.In fact, she just found out.She\u2019s so awesome.This buff made life so easy.On the other hand, Liang Yueqi gave up before she was half done.Hearing the teacher ask the last question, Liang Yueqi quickly looked at Lu Zhen and found that he had answered the question.Liang Yueqi took the paper and asked softly, \u201cLu Zhen, how to do the last question? I can\u2019t do it.\u201dLu Zhen threw his pen, his eyes cold: \u201cNot an average question.\u201dLiang Yueqi: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe teacher of the winter camp paid special attention to the communication with the students, and praised Chu Yin several times that day.After two days of class, Chu Yin\u2019s nickname in the camp had changed from \u201cthe girl who was very beautiful\u201d to \u201cthe beauty who was very good at solving questions\u201d.She became a popular figure in the camp. At night, people came to the dormitory to look for her.However, this kind of behavior means a lot. Many people actually wanted to see what Chu Yin was doing at night, or what exercise book she used.Tomorrow was the last evaluation test. They would know the ranking and results. This would ultimately affect whether they could participate in the next Hope Cup.After realizing her soaring level, Chu Yin\u2019s state of mind became much more stable. She would do some exercises at night and before going to sleep.Chapter 33 \u2013 Fate and Destined (3)The student that was in the same dormitory as her seemed to be stimulated because of her. She also took out the habit of not sleeping. She plays with her life by studying hard.Liang Yueqi looked at the situation in the dormitory, sat in front of the desk, and opened a set of questions during the day.At last, she went to see the girl in the middle school next door and asked her for advice.\u201cClassmate,\u201d Liang Yueqi walked over and said with a gentle smile, \u201cCan you teach me this problem?\u201dShe looked up and said, \u201cYou can\u2019t even do this?\u201dHan Chuying almost couldn\u2019t hold back her laugh.The female student was straightforward: \u201cHow did you get in?\u201dLiang Yueqi\u2019s face turned green.On the second day of the proficiency test, the table of seats was posted outside the examination room.Chu Yin and Lu Zhen got together again.But this time, fortunately, he was behind, otherwise she would have to figure out how to make the dog man blind.After handing out their bags and mobile phones, the students sat in their respective seats. The teacher then distributed the papers.Lu Zhen took the paper, turned it over, and handed it to Chu Yin.At the moment when Chu Yin received the examination paper, she heard him whisper: \u201cAre you sure you can surpass me?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dAh, teacher! He provoked me!!!Chu Yin\u2019s fighting spirit was instantly in full force. It lasted until the end of the exam.The efficiency of the winter camp was very high. The test was finished on the same day and the results were given on the same day.Han Chuying knew that Chu Yin valued the results very much, and took her to the bulletin board to see the result.Although Chu Yin was sure of her results, she didn\u2019t know the level of others, so her heart was still beating.Then she saw herself in third place on the list.\u201cMy God, you\u2019re amazing!\u201dHan Chuying didn\u2019t pay attention to her ranking. She just felt that Chu Yin was too strong. She wanted to take a picture of the ranking and send it to the forum of Huiwen, so that those sour chickens who jumped out from time to time could have a look.If Chu Yin could win the prize in the Hope Cup, Han Chuying expected that she would really become a campus goddess.Chu Yin looked at her own results and was relieved that she had the authority \u221aAfter taking another look, she saw Lu Zhen in fourth!Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!She finally beat the dog man!No one can beat me!!\u201cDing \u2013 being in top five in proficiency test\u201d task completed! Host, congratulations for getting permission to change a single sentence and a random reward phrase card.Chu Yin: \u201cGood, very good.\u201dThen she had the leisure to look at other people\u2019s rankings. Han Chuying was in 15th.Liang Yueqi was at the bottom of the ranking list.Han Chuying said in a low voice: \u201cSo what is this young lady doing here? It\u2019s not a public punishment\u2026\u201dChu Yin thought: Some people are not here to learn, they are here to find the emotional line.Well, emotional line?Chu Yin\u2019s mind suddenly moved.Because the plot of the winter camp had never happened in her last life, Chu Yin had nothing to change. But she suddenly realized that besides change, she could also create!On the second day after the proficiency test, the winter camp took an afternoon off, allowing students to go out of the school and make their own arrangements. Han Chuying seized the opportunity and invited Chu Yin to go out with her.Going out with a beautiful woman! They can go and buy clothes! She can also take pictures of Chu Yin! Ah, ah, ah!Chu Yin had no opinion, but before going out, she opened today\u2019s script.[ Chu Yin and Han Chuying went out of H University and went to the shopping mall nearby to have a meal.There were many students there who are also in winter camp. Both Chu Yin and Han Chuying ate and drank to release pressure.Before long, they met Lu Zhen by chance. ]Bah, I don\u2019t believe in chance!Rubbish script! The power of male lead was still pushing Lu Zhen to her side.But she had a new idea today \u2013 Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to go along with Lu Zhen\u2019s emotional line, so she could try to let Lu Zhen develop feelings with other girls!She had made many attempts before, such as sending Song Zhaolin as the school\u2019s flower to form an official loveteam with Lu Zhen, and making Zheng Yu directly confess affectionately to Lu Zhen, and so on.She thought that maybe Liang Yueqi had a chance, a chance to start \u2013 a love that was not from chance!Chu Yin rubbed her fists and scratched the sentence [Soon, they met Lu Zhen by chance].And changed it to:[ Here, Lu Zhen and Liang Yueqi experienced a romantic encounter. ]\u2014\u2014She\u2019s really an artist! making love teams for you!She\u2019s a genius!!Romantic encounter! These words are very wonderful, revealing the ambiguity!Good luck, Liang Yueqi! I can only help you here!\u2026\u2026The dormitory was half empty in the afternoon.In the end, the top students couldn\u2019t help their restless hearts and went out to play togetherLu Zhen lived in the hotel opposite H University. He stood by the window for a while and saw Chu Yin and her classmate came out and got on the bus to the city center.Lu Zhen changed his clothes, then went out and got on the waiting car by the road.\u201cWhere are you going, young master?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cFollow the No.13 bus.\u201dSeeing Chu Yin getting off at the entrance of the mall from a distance, Lu Zhen stopped and got off from the side of the road.Looking up again, he suddenly saw Liang Yueqi\u2019s face.\u201cLu Zhen,\u201d Liang Yueqi surprised, \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201dIn the warm winter sun, the charming young lady and the noble young master met on the busy street of an unfamiliar city. It\u2019s really romantic.Lu Zhen\u2019s face was cold: \u201cYes.\u201dHe answered casually, then turned his head, only to find that Chu Yin\u2019s back disappeared.Lu Zhen felt a little irritated. He turned and strode into the mall.He went around and still didn\u2019t find her. He stopped in front of a dessert shop, frowning.Suddenly, Liang Yueqi came out of the shop and met him again by chance.The charming young lady was standing in front of the pink neon light with a strawberry milkshake in her hand, which made this romantic scene extremely sweet.Liang Yueqi was also very surprised: \u201cWhat a coincidence, Lu Zhen, we met again!\u201dIt felt as if this kind of fate was arranged by the heavens.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe paused for a few seconds, turned, and left.And next.When Lu Zhen entered the convenience store, Liang Yueqi would appear behind the opposite shelf.When Lu Zhen chose a western restaurant, Liang Yueqi sat at the next table.When Lu Zhen followed the path of other students to the upstairs cinema to find Chu Yin, Liang Yueqi appeared in front of the popcorn machine at the gate of the cinema again.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dLiang Yueqi: \u201cHahaha. Good luck.\u201dLu Zhen looked at her, his indifferent expression had slightly cracked.After a long time, he took a deep breath and finally spoke.\u201c\u2026Are you a damn ghost?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Han Chuying saw that Chu Yin was in a good mood while watching the movie.Chu Yin is a mature person. This made people around her feel comfortable. Because Chu Yin mostly has indifferent expressions and doesn\u2019t talk much, she appears to be a cold person.Han Chuyin likes to observe beautiful women. After living with her in the dormitory for a few days, she already grasped Chu Yin\u2019s mood.Just like now, Chu Yin\u2019s lips were turned upward even though the movie was not funny. This showed that she was in a good mood.After the light on the big screen illuminated Chu Yin\u2019s side face, Han Chuyin was mesmerized again. She took several seconds to swallow before she leaned in closer to whisper, \u201cYin Yin, what are you smiling at?\u201dChu Yin turned her head and gave a smile: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just I haven\u2019t seen a movie in a long time.\u201dShe was thinking that the romantic encounter she made was interesting. She hoped that both Lu Zhen and Liang Yueqi won\u2019t let her down.Based on her calculations, the script had started moving. Otherwise, it was impossible to not meet Lu Zhen after having walked for so long.Han Chuying didn\u2019t know what she was thinking, but she took this opportunity to propose in secret:\u201cIs that so? How about we watch more movies in the future?\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Chu Yin immediately agreed.Han Chuying was happy.She could date Chu Yin many times again! Yeah!!!\u2026\u2026Liang Yueqi was in a bad mood.This summer camp did not look at the family background. They only focused on grades. She was a rich young lady. Since she was a kid, she had everything she wanted in the palm of her hand. But this winter camp made her sink to the bottom!She felt worse after seeing that Chu Yin placed third in the rankings.Although it\u2019s a given that Chu Yin couldn\u2019t be her opponent, she still felt she couldn\u2019t stand at the same level as her.Liang Yueqi didn\u2019t show herself that much after seeing her results in the proficiency test. She was glad that there were no other students besides the contestants. Otherwise, it would be too humiliating for her to return to school.Liang Yueqi came here to cultivate feelings with Lu Zhen. Even after so many days had passed, she couldn\u2019t find any chance.But she didn\u2019t expect she would meet Lu Zhen many times today!This encounter felt like it was arranged by the gods. No girl wouldn\u2019t want this fated romance.Liang Yueqi\u2019s heart was beating.Isn\u2019t this a hint that they would always meet even in the next life?So when she saw Lu Zhen in front of the popcorn machine, Liang Yueqi believed it was fate.\u201c-Of course I\u2019m not a ghost! How can you still be joking?\u201d Liang Yueqi blushed and lowered her head as she smiled. \u201cLu Zhen, don\u2019t you think this is predestined?\u201dLu Zhen didn\u2019t think so.But when he listened to Liang Yueqi\u2019s words, his eyebrows gently moved.Liang Yueqi was certainly not a ghost. But the feeling of being arranged\u2026Lu Zhen vaguely thought of something, but before he had time to think deeply, he was interrupted by Liang Yueqi\u2019s voice.\u201cLu Zhen, now that you are here, do you want to go to the movies together?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyes were raised as he coldly said, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t want to.\u201dAfter Lu Zhen coldly refused Liang Yueqi\u2019s invitation, he turned and walked out of the mall.There were several WeChat notifications from Lu Zhen\u2019s phone. The messages were filled with a cheerful aura.[Brother Zhen~ Brother Zhen, I\u2019m at your winter camp! Ha ha ha!][My brother found out about my grades. I\u2019ve been beaten to death. *crying*][Where are you? I have no time left!! I came to play with you!!]Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe young master endured for a few seconds before he suppressed the impulse to block Song Zhaolin in his contacts.Just then, his mobile phone suddenly rang.It was Grandfather Lu.\u201cGrandfather.\u201d Lu Zhen answered.\u201cYou, child! You forget your family when you\u2019re not at home.\u201d Grandfather Lu scolded him on the other end of the phone. \u201cYou worried your grandfather!\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cEverything is fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dGrandfather Lu also knew that his grandson was competitive and superior in all aspects. He didn\u2019t need to worry about it. The purpose of his call was not this: \u201cI wanted to know if the winter camp Liang Yueqi went to is the same camp you went to?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows creased: \u201cWhere did you hear this?\u201d\u201cLinyuan\u00a01\u00a0told me. I wouldn\u2019t know this if he hadn\u2019t told me!\u201dLu Zhen slightly lowered his eyelashes. No one knew what he was thinking.Grandfather Lu continued: \u201cDon\u2019t be so cold. You will hurt the little girl\u2019s heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen truthfully replied, \u201cShe\u2019s probably hurt already.\u201d\u201cYou child!\u2014\u2014\u201d Grandfather Lu angrily stamped his crutch and said in a more serious tone: \u201cYou need to take care of her more carefully. Do you hear me?\u201dLu Zhen hung up the phone. There were no fluctuations in his dark eyes.There were many disputes among the rich and powerful families. They regard emotion and marriage as bargaining chips.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t care about this long ago. But now, it was different.Care?He\u2019s not interested.Chu Yin and her friend came out after the movie and planned to buy another dessert before going back to school.When they arrived at the dessert station, they met several male students in the winter camp. One of the male students sat in front of her during class.These male students were all in the top ten. Seeing from this distance, one could guess their academic standings.They didn\u2019t plan to greet them. But Chu Yin and Han Chuyin didn\u2019t expect that when they passed by, the male students took the initiative to say hello.In their circle, strength is everything. Since Chu Yin ranked third in the proficiency test, the boys had already accepted her as their kind. Plus, she was also beautiful.\u201cCongratulations on placing first in the exam.\u201d Chu Yin gave a friendly smile.These male students had no experience talking to girls. When they saw Chu Yin\u2019s smile from a close distance, their faces turned red.The male student who sat in front of Chu Yin during class coughed as he asked, \u201cEveryone will be studying in the library after school. You can come too if you like.\u201dThe boys behind him teased, \u201cOh\u2026Brother Wang~\u201dBrother Wang\u2019s face flushed red.Chu Yin nodded with a smile. The boys left with a smile and excitement in their hearts.After they left, Han Chuying asked Chu Yin, \u201cDo you want to go?\u201dChu Yin bought a cup of ice cream and said with a smile, \u201cOf course not.\u201dExtremely beautiful yet very heartless.Han Chuying: \u201cAlthough I don\u2019t like boys, Wang Lei is an exception! It should be helpful to study with him.\u201dAfter all, she knew Chu Yin was serious about learning.Chu Yin took a spoonful of ice cream. She smiled as her eyebrows lifted, \u201cLearning together will only affect each other. There\u2019s no need. Girls don\u2019t need to think they\u2019re weak. The boys do have advantages in competitions. But believing in ourselves is not bad either.\u201dAs Han Chuyin held the ice cream spoon, she realized at this moment she could die from Chu Yin\u2019s charms.Beautiful, strong, and independent.How can a charming girl like this exist!!!She announced that from today on, Chu Yin was her goddess! Ah, ah, ah!After the short break, the training course of the winter camp continued.The next day when Chu Yin entered the classroom, she quietly observed Lu Zhen and Liang Yueqi.Although they were sitting far away, the romantic encounter they experienced might change their feelings towards each other?After staring for a few seconds, the dog man suddenly felt something and looked back.Chu Yin immediately lowered her eyes and reviewed her test papers as if nothing happened. Her acting skills were good.Lu Zhen looked at her from a distance and laughed at himself after.For a moment, he thought she was looking at him.But how could it be?The little nerd\u2019s eyes are only for learning.Chapter 34 \u2013 Shake! (2)After the proficiency test, the class seat arrangement had been adjusted. Students who ranked first in the test sat in the front row according to the teacher\u2019s guidance.The first few days in the camp were considered an adjustment period. But after the proficiency test, the difficulty level of the course increased.This time, the students experienced a term called \u2018hardcore learning\u2019Menelaus theorem, Simpson theorem, strawalt theorem, and deshague theorem. All kinds of theorems piled their brains like ocean waves.These theorems would only be taught once. After this, they would have to test their level of learning through exam questions.Except for Wang Lei, the student who sat in front of Chu Yin, everyone almost died of the pressure.Han Chuying laid on the table and said, \u201cI\u2019m homesick.\u201dThis is horrible. Woo woo.Chu Yin also felt the pressure.And the scariest thing in a place like this was that no matter how hard you try to catch up, there would always be someone who would do better than you.Chu Yin pursed her lips. She forced herself to keep up with the rhythm. Only when break time came did she lean back in her chair and rest.If an opportunity arrives, she must give herself a buff that enhances concentration and a good mentality.Compared with her, Lu Zhen\u2019s state was much more lacking.After class, Lu Zhen stood up from his seat. When he turned around, he saw Chu Yin lying on the table alone. The students beside her went out of the room to relax.The size of the table of this school was very small. The seat was also uncomfortable. Chu Yin held her arms as her shoulder shrunk. She looked very tiny.Lu Zhen suddenly found her painful to look at.A stream of notifications popped on his phone.[Brother Zhen! Where should I go if I want to play with you and Sister Yin! *sobs* ][So boring! So lonely! I want someone to accompany me!]Lu Zhen replied coldly: [Don\u2019t disturb her.]When the bell rang, the students groaned as they walked back to their classroom. Chu Yin rubbed her eyes and got up from the table.Then she saw a can of coffee in the corner of her table.Chu Yin looked at the space beside her. Did Han Chuying buy it?She opened the can, drank half of it, and felt more energetic than before. She then plunged herself into math problems again.After studying for a few days, Chu Yin felt her brain improving. Maybe because the more the brain gets used, the smarter it gets.The winter camp organizers knew that too much studying would drive these kids crazy so they gave them half a day off in the afternoon.Chu Shi called Chu Yin every day. When Chu Yin almost finished her class, she received Chu Shi\u2019s WeChat message.[Thanks for your hard work! ][There\u2019s someone who came to see you on behalf of your brother today. He is now downstairs ~][Brother asked him to bring you a lot of food, okay?]When Chu Yin finished reading the message, she sighed and guessed it was Gu Qiuze.The teacher mentioned before that they invited past outstanding students to share their experiences. Gu Qiuze appearing here was reasonable.Chu Yin and Han Chuying went downstairs to meet him.They glanced outside the school building and didn\u2019t find Gu Qiuze.But a familiar face appeared out of nowhere, \u201c\u2014Sister Yin!\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s eyes were full of tears.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Chu Yin felt goosebumps on her skin, \u201cLinlin.\u201dSong Zhaolin was about to jump forward before he was dragged back by the back collar. Lu Zhen frowned as he pulled him away impatiently.He immediately got upset after hearing Song Zhaolin\u2019s voice screaming Chu Yin\u2019s name.Song Zhaolin was forced to express his feelings from a distance: \u201cSister Yin, didn\u2019t you miss me! I\u2019ve been here a long time! But Brother Zhen said that your studies are very important and I should not disturb you! At last, you have a break today! Wuwuwuwu!\u201dChu Yin looked at Lu Zhen and thought that the dog man had done a good thing.If Song Zhaolin bothered her, she would pack him up and send him home.However, since she hadn\u2019t seen her deskmate since the holiday started, Chu Yin realized she missed him.Lu Zhen was listening to their chatters in silence. The more he listened, the worse he felt.Just then, another voice joined in: \u201cLittle yin?\u201dAs soon as Chu Yin looked back, she saw Gu Qiuze carrying a big bag.She laughed: \u201cYes, it\u2019s me.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s face became darker.Chu Yin felt that this scene was suffocating.In her last life, Lu Zhen and Gu Qiuze were rivals. For the first time in her life, all three of them gathered together.Although she knew that this time there were no complication resentments between them, she still felt a little tension in the air. She just wanted to get things done and leave immediately.Lu Zhen\u2019s aura became cold and dark.Song Zhaolin instinctively shrank behind Chu Yin.Lu Zhen looked at Gu Qiuze: \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dGu Qiuze raised the bag in his hand: \u201cGiving something to Little Yin.\u201dChu Yin said, \u201cI heard from my brother. Thank you for your trouble.\u201dGu Qiuze looked at her with a smile: \u201cIt was no trouble. I will help you tomorrow.\u201dLu Zhen chuckled, but his smile didn\u2019t reach his eyes.The Lu family and the Gu family were two of the most outstanding young people of the generation. Of course, there would be a natural disharmony between them.Chu Yin felt helpless. She didn\u2019t want to have any relations with the mess these two had.Song Zhaolin whispered behind Chu Yin, \u201cSister Yin, do you know what this scene looks like now?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhat?\u201dSong Zhaolin shivered: \u201cShura field\u00a01\u2026\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dFix your grandmother\u2019s leg!!\u00a02.Chapter 34 \u2013 Shake! ( 3)Because of Song Zhaolin\u2019s final results, he was punished by his brother. He escaped with no money.Despite staying in the city for several days, no one accompanied him to play. He finally caught them during their break time.He first set up a WeChat group.As the common friend of all Huiwen students, he consciously acted as the bridge.Chu Yin, Lu Zhen, Gu Qiuze, and Liang Yueqi were all invited to this group. When Chu Yin saw this, she almost killed him.After a while, Song Zhaolin got Han Chuying\u2019s WeChat and invited her in. A small group of six was united together.[Dear ones!!!][We, Huiwen students, should unite in a foreign land!!]After a while, Liang Yueqi replied to him: [Hello *shy face*]Chu Yin, Han Chuying, and Liang Yueqi were all in the same dormitory. It was only Liang Yueqi who wasn\u2019t answering the review materials and was just looking at her mobile phone.After a while, Gu Qiuze also replied: \u201cHello, school mates, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201dLiang Yueqi: [Thank you for your concern [happy] ~]Han Chuying stealthily sent Chu Yin a message: [I don\u2019t want to talk in the group]Chu Yin: [Then don\u2019t talk.]At this time, in the hotel room, Lu Zhen was also looking at the mobile phone.Song Zhaolin was in his room. Lu Zhen watched him invite Chu Yin in the group.Lu Zhen opened the group and looked at the picture called \u201cNDCY\u201d.His fingertips flushed as it touched the mobile screen.Her display picture was a laughing dog. But it didn\u2019t seem to be Chu Yin\u2019s personality? Lu Zhen stared at it for a long time.He thought for a moment before adding it.On the other side, in the dormitory, Han Chuying gave a strange \u201ceh\u201d and asked, \u201cLu Zhen added me?\u201dLiang Yueqi suddenly raised her head from the bed.Chu Yin was relieved when she heard it. She just looked at the friend request from the dog man.She was a little worried about his intentions. It seemed that he would also add other people.Han Chuying looked over: \u201cI don\u2019t know him. Are you familiar with him? Do you want to add him instead?\u201dLiang Yueqi raised her ears again.Chu Yin\u2019s face was cold: \u201cNot familiar. Won\u2019t add.\u201dLiang Yueqi listened with a smile.According to her observation for many days, Chu Yin was a complete nerd who only knows learning. Now she couldn\u2019t help but doubt whether her previous guess was true.Is Lu Zhen interested in this kind of girl?\u201cLu Zhen generally does not add people,\u201d Liang Yueqi said with a familiar tone, \u201cThis time maybe because of so many unfamiliar faces in this province, so he added you ~ there is no pressure.\u201dLiang Yueqi\u2019s attitude satisfied Chu Yin.Come on, keep developing your love, don\u2019t stop!Song Zhaolin was still chatting in the group.[Since it\u2019s break time, we should go somewhere! There\u2019s a place in Chunhai Park, three kilometers away from here, that offers air bike sports! Two people can sit in one car.]Liang Yueqi: [Sounds very interesting! ]Gu Qiuze: [I can go with you to play *laugh*]Song Zhaolin raised his head and asked Lu Zhen, \u201cBrother Zhen, come and play together.\u201dLu Zhen was still waiting for the reply of others.Song Zhaolin was excited: @Chu Yin and Han Chuying: [Are you coming?]Han Chuying was not interested, \u201cYin Yin, are you going?\u201dChu Yin looked back and saw that their top student dorm mate was still studying in the corner. She didn\u2019t even relax even though it was break time.Chu Yin was about to coldly refuse but Gu Qiuze suddenly tagged her: [Little Yin, come and play, I\u2019ll join you.]Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen who saw the news: \u201c\u2026.\u201dSong Zhaolin was in excitement\u2014\u2014He thought it was a perfect match for three men and three women! Brother Zhen and Miss Liang must be in the same group. Then Gu Qiuze and Han Chuying are in the second group, and he and Sister Yin in the same group! Perfect!What\u2019s wrong with Gu Qiuze?!Chu Yin was silent.She could refuse Song Zhaolin, a silly son, at will. But Gu Qiuze who came here to deliver things her brother gave\u2026she couldn\u2019t refuse easily.Chu Yin wanted to stay to study.After a long struggle, Chu Yin silently took out the script.Since she couldn\u2019t refuse directly, she had to create factors.After more than ten minutes, Chu Yin in the group finally replied: [It seems that the weather is not good today.]At this time, Song Zhaolin had already gone out of the hotel. He looked up at the big sun in the sky and scratched his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not? Sister Yin\u2019s reason not to go is too careless!\u201dSong Zhaolin hopped in the sun: \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful day!\u201dLu Zhen was standing outside the hotel building, frowning at the message sent by Chu Yin in the group.He looked at his phone. Seeing that the other party hadn\u2019t accepted his friend request yet, he chuckled grimly.After locking the screen, he looked up and suddenly saw drops of water slowly trickling down Song Zhaolin\u2019s face.Lu Zhen: \u201c?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen was silent for a moment, \u201cDo you really want to go?\u201dAre you crying?Then there was another drop of water on Song Zhaolin\u2019s face, as if in tears.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin wiped his face and said, \u201cNo, it seems to be raining.\u201dIn the dormitory.Chu Yin put away the script of \u201csunny weather\u201d to \u201cheavy rain with snow\u201d.She took out the math paper with ease.She\u2019s really a qualified script artist! Not only can she make knives rain down the sky, but can also dominate the weather! Summon the wind and call for the rain!Tremble, world!This is her power!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)Song Zhaolin stood at the door of the hotel, looking at the crackling sleet.At this moment, his heart was like the weather \u2013 bitter wind and rain.He just wanted to be a kid\u00a01! Why is it so hard!Lu Zhen stood beside him, slightly frowning. No one could tell what he was thinking.Although it\u2019s normal for the weather to change suddenly, this rain suspiciously came at the right time.Song Zhaolin looked down at his phone and sighed: \u201cI asked Sister Yin how she knew about the bad weather.\u201dLu Zhen frowned as he turned his head: \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cShe called the weather observatory.\u201d Song Zhaolin said with a dull expression.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t speak. His eyes lowered as he turned on his phone and looked at the weather forecast.The forecast really showed rain and snow.The weather changes from time to time. It doesn\u2019t seem unusual for something like this to happen.But Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t understand the reason strange things kept on happening. At this moment, Lu Zhen had an absurd idea.Can all this be happening because of Chu Yin? The weather got affected because she didn\u2019t want to come?But then he realized how impractical the idea was.How can the weather be controlled by an average person? People can\u2019t even predict it accurately.If Chu Yun really had this kind of power, he could easily be destroyed by her.Compared with those absurd assumptions, Lu Zhen was more concerned about another thing at this time.\u201cWhen did you add her?\u201dSong Zhaolin gave an \u201cah\u201d and scratched his head: \u201cWhen\u2026I think \u2013 maybe when I became a school flower?\u201dHee hee, I\u2019m sorry~Lu Zhen\u2019s mood became bad.He looked down at a certain member of the group, NDCY.It\u2019s you, yes, Chu Yin.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes drooped. The brown and red tear mole could be seen. These four letters were reflected in his eyes.After a long time of deep thought, he raised his eyes and pretended to act indifferent, \u201cSo NDCY is Chu Yin?\u201dSong Zhaolin responded: \u201cOh, yes!\u201dThen he suddenly remembered something. He squealed in excitement, \u201cDo you know what it meant? I looked it up and it meant \u2018rarely confused\u2019\u00a02\u00a0and \u2018sincere\u2019. I asked Sister Yin about it\u2026\u201dLu Zhen turned his head, looking indifferent, \u201cso what is it, actually?\u201dSong Zhaolin laughed like a broken record, \u201cYour father Chu Yin!\u00a03\u00a0Hahahahahaha!\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin couldn\u2019t see Lu Zhen\u2019s face anymore since he fell on the elevator floor while laughing.His character was like this. It\u2019s easy to make him happy \u2013 Even if it stormed and rained outside. Even if his father Chu Yin just refused his invitation!Lu Zhen doubted life in this short time. The person he thought was clever, dull, low-key, and only had studying in her mind. This little nerd\u2026It turned out she could be wild?Was it because his perception was wrong? Or was Chu Yin deliberately hiding from him?Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know why, but\u2026He suddenly felt a sense of inexplicable pleasure at this possibility.\u2026With the miserable weather, Chu Yin spent the afternoon in the dormitory working on her math problems.Han Chuying also followed in her footsteps. Since Chu Yin, her goddess, was reviewing math problems, she also dared not be complacent.Their roommate was also the same. She worked as hard as them to the point that her body reflected burning flames.Liang Yueqi felt out of place.She chose to live in the dormitory because she wanted to closely observe Chu Yin. But now she felt she was wronged.These people were not normal. They only knew studying. They did exercise problems every day. When facing them, Liang Yueqi felt a sense of superiority.She didn\u2019t need to fight a person (Chu Yin) who\u2019s like this.For example, their dormitory mate, whose family background was not good. Even if studied hard all her life, she would not be better than her.Liang Yueqi had the time to go out this afternoon. But because of the sudden bad weather, she had no choice but to stay here and watch them study.\u00a0 She sat in her seat and watched the female student next to her, \u201cYou\u2019ve been studying all day. Take a rest. It\u2019s useless to study like this.\u201dThe female student silently looked at her then lowered her head again to resume her math problems.Han Chuyin happened to be resting at this time. When she saw this scene, there was joy in her heart.The female student\u2019s actions could be expressed as: After seeing you, I feel that studying is more necessary.Liang Yueqi was unhappy. How can this person not appreciate her kind actions?Chu Yin finished a set of questions and drank her drink during her break.She couldn\u2019t understand the significance of Liang Yueqi staying in this dormitory when her priority wasn\u2019t studying. Since her main purpose was Lu Zhen, shouldn\u2019t she go and look for Lu Zhen to develop their relationship?Can this heavy rain and snow stop your love?It should not be.No one in the dormitory answered Liang Yueqi for a while.She had never lived in a dormitory before and had never been treated so coldly. For the first time in her life, she felt the feeling of being excluded.Liang Yueqi frowned. Thinking that she was reasonable, she continued, \u201cI care about you. I\u2019m not saying this to harm you. I just felt that the teaching method of this winter camp is not reasonable. It\u2019s meaningless for you to continue learning like this. What\u2019s more, there are many competitions. Since you can\u2019t possibly surpass them even if you study hard, what\u2019s the point?\u201dChapter 35 \u2013 Let the world be full of love! (2)After listening, Han Chuying frowned directly.Chu Yin gently raised her eyebrows.These were the words of a young lady who had never experienced suffering.Chu Yin knew that persuading a person to give up when there are still no results was annoying.She turned her head and looked at Liang Yueqi. When she was about to open her mouth, the female student who was \u2018advised\u2019 by Liang Yueqi, suddenly raised her head.\u201cWould you shut up, please?\u201d She said plainly, \u201cDo you know that you\u2019re noisy?\u201dThe dormitory was quiet for three seconds.Then, Chu Yin broke the silence with a laugh.This female student was interesting. She thought this dorm mate would have a silent character. She didn\u2019t expect her mouth to be so strict.Liang Yueqi was surprised for two seconds. She then instantly became angry: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dShe is the only daughter of the Liang family!The female student nodded: \u201cI know.\u201dShe paused for two seconds: \u201cYou\u2019re ranked last in the whole camp.\u201dChu Yin &amp; Han Chuying: \u201cHa ha ha ha\u201dSorry, they couldn\u2019t help it.\u2026\u2026Liang Yueqi\u2019s mentality collapsed. She left the dormitory without taking anything.She was really fed up with these nerds without EQ!The rain outside had stopped. Liang Yueqi stepped outside with her small leather boots. While walking, she suddenly saw Lu Zhen and Song Zhaolin approaching.Filled with grief, she quickly walked up to Lu Zhen and looked at him with teary eyes, \u201cLu Zhen, I\u2019ve been bullied by my dorm mates.\u201dSong Zhaolin stared: \u201cAh? Really? By whom?\u201dLiang Yueqi looked at him and said aggrievedly, \u201cBy Chu Yin and her friends.\u201d\u201cAh?\u201d Song Zhaolin raised his hand and touched his head.With his understanding of Chu Yin, she wouldn\u2019t bother excluding others. At that time when she was excluded by Class 5 and he was the only one in class talking to her, Chu Yin didn\u2019t care at all.Her heart only knew how to study. She simply could not do childish things like these.\u201cI was not used to living in dormitories, but I wanted to be close to my dorm mates, so I stayed. I didn\u2019t expect I would be excluded\u2026 \u201cLiang Yueqi lowered her head, looking pitiful and weak, which could arouse people\u2019s desire for protection.But the young man in front of her only looked at her coldly.\u201cWhen you were with Fu Mingxuan before, who were you trying to bully?\u201d He asked suddenly.Liang Yueqi\u2019s face turned white.Since her grandfather suppressed this matter, the Lu family didn\u2019t go deeply into it. She thought Lu Zhen wouldn\u2019t remember it. She didn\u2019t expect he would mention this matter at this time!Liang Yueqi reluctantly said with a smile: \u201cThat was a misunderstanding\u2026\u201dLu Zhen nodded. There were no fluctuations in his eyes: \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, you should also think that this time is also a misunderstanding\u2026\u201dThen he turned and left.Song Zhaolin caught up with him, \u201cDamn! That was ruthless.\u201dThe latest person he had seen so ruthless was his Sister Yin.Lu Zhen looked up at the dormitory building and then to Song Zhaolin: \u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201dSong Zhaolin stayed in his hotel and waited for the rain to stop. He insisted on pulling Lu Zhen out to play and had no hope of convincing Lu Zhen but who knew he was actually successful?Song Zhaolin had an idea: \u201cLet\u2019s go to your classroom and have a look!\u201dThe classroom was usually open. Some students who didn\u2019t want to go to the library would go to the classroom to self-study.Lu Zhen slightly lowered his eyes: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dSong Zhaolin went to the school building and looked at the facilities of the University. Suddenly, he caught a glimpse of a red list posted on the bulletin board on the first floor.\u201cDid you take the exam?\u201d Song Zhaolin walked over, took a look, and then exclaimed: \u201cDamn! Sister Yin is in third place!\u201dAfter a second, there was another exclamation: \u201cDamn! Brother Zhen is in fourth! You two are so awesome!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips gently tilted. His eyes showed a light pleasure.Song Zhaolin knew that this place was not Huiwen. Being in the top three in this result could be considered as a ranking in the whole city. Song Zhaolin suddenly got excited. He got his phone and took a photo, \u201cYou are too low-key. How can you not brag about this kind of good result! I\u2019ll help you brag~\u201dBefore long, a new thread was posted in the Huiwen\u2019s forum.[Good news! Let\u2019s warmly celebrate the excellent results of our students in the Hope Cup Winter Camp level test!]A list of photos was attached to the thread. Several students from Huiwen were in the photo.Since it was winter vacation, the students were just idling at home. When this thread was published, they immediately read it.Anonymous 1: Who is LZ? Is he one of the winter camp participants?Anonymous 2 (LZ): No, I\u2019m just one of the participant\u2019s family members.Anonymous 3: Ahhh!!! Brother Zhen is in fourth! He\u2019s too powerful! My male god is powerful!Anonymous 4: Are you blind? Didn\u2019t you see the name of the person who ranked third?Anonymous 5 (LZ): No fighting! It\u2019s useless!Fangirling between the school\u2019s apollo and quasi school\u2019s flower then appeared in this thread.Anonymous 28: Brother Zhen is both handsome and intelligent. What kind of man is this! Mom, I\u2019m in love!Anonymous 34: I love Chu Yin. My sister is beautiful and strong. Marry me!Anonymous 35: Since the last time a man surnamed Zheng knelt, no one dared to chase her. After seeing this thread, I now know how many people are waiting in line.Anonymous 36: +1Anonymous 37: +2Anonymous 40: +1008611Song Zhaolin happily watched his post become hot as two groups of people fangirled on their own.He would fangirl in Chu Yin\u2019s group and would then fangirl next in Lu Zhen\u2019s group. He was proud of himself.But at this time, someone suddenly found a blind spot on the red list.Anonymous 78: Is it just me?? Is Liang Yueqi the last one???More and more people found this blind spot as soon as someone pointed it out.Anonymous 80: You discovered it!Anonymous 81: Is this true? Next to her name is Huiwen\u2019s Private High School.Anonymous 82: What is she doing?? I know that she didn\u2019t get the slot in the winter camp.Anonymous 83: Their family invested so much that she got a slot in the winter camp. Unfortunately, she was beaten by these intelligent students.The direction of the thread turned into a group of ridicules towards Liang Yueqi.Chapter 35 \u2013 Let the world be full of love! (3)(t/n: sorry for posting the wrong order for the chapters. I scheduled part 2 to be posted before part 3 but there seemed to be a problem with wordpress that resulted to part 3 being posted first. if you missed part 2, here\u2019s the link. (or you can browse my site for the chapters). Thank you for telling me that part 2 wasn\u2019t posted~ <3)When she received Fu Mingxuan\u2019s WeChat and learned that her results had been posted on the forum, she choked.Fu Mingxuan was upset about the incident last time where Liang Yueqi cheated on her. When she knew that Liang Yueqi went there for Lu Zhen, she felt sore and relieved at the same time.[Oh, Yueqi, why didn\u2019t you tell me you went to the winter camp? ][Well, even if you tell me, I won\u2019t dare go. My final math test result is only 130. I won\u2019t insult myself.]Liang Yueqi: \u201c\u2026\u201dLiang Yueqi didn\u2019t pass the final math exam.That night, Liang Yueqi\u2019s mentality completely collapsed. She withdrew from the winter camp and went back to the city.\u2026\u2026The next day, no one cared about the person who withdrew.If you don\u2019t give up, you won\u2019t necessarily win. But if you give up, you have already lost.The war among the top students was still in progress.However, today was a little different. They invited outstanding seniors from the past. The girls were very excited because of their outstanding appearance.Although there was already a handsome guy in the camp, it was never too much to have more!When Chu Yin rushed to the classroom with the book in her arms, she was stopped halfway.Gu Qiuze stood in front of her as he smilingly handed a can of coffee: \u201cDon\u2019t panic. It\u2019s not the time for class yet.\u201dChu Yin nodded and took the coffee: \u201cThank you, senior.\u201d\u201cEh? This little student\u2026\u201d Gu Qiuze said with a smile. \u201cYou used to call me brother.\u201dChu Yin did mean to keep a distance.She felt not secured whenever she got involved between Gu Qiuze and Lu Zhen. Chu Yin didn\u2019t want either side so she simply kept her distance.Gu Qiuze looked down at the girl in front of him with a gentle look.When the winter camp invited Gu Qiuze, he was going to reject it. But when Chu Shi asked him to come and see if Chu Yin needed help, he suddenly wanted to come.Chu Yin was beautiful and excellent. All these attributes were superficial. Gu Qiuze was more curious about her because she was mature in her age. The more he talked to her, the more he could vaguely feel it.It\u2019s very interesting.And\u2026Gu Qiuze also felt some subtle things from Lu Zhen.It\u2019s even more interesting.They said a few words before Chu Yin found an excuse to leave.Not long after she left, Gu Qiuze met Lu Zhen.Their unfriendly gazes collided with each other.Lu Zhen asked in a light voice, \u201cWhat were you two talking about?\u201dHe saw from a distance that Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to talk to Gu Qiuze. Her body language showed that she was unfamiliar with him. It seemed she didn\u2019t like Gu Qiuze who was a good student.Gu Qiuze said with a smile: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t concern you, Young Master Lu. Shouldn\u2019t you care about the daughter of the Liang family who went back last night?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows raised as he sneered: \u201cDoes it have something to do with me?\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It all depends on you, Young Master Lu.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s black eyes looked especially cold. The radian of his lips showed a trace of arrogance. \u201cWhen you have the right to speak in the Gu family, you can tell me these again.\u201dThen he went inside the classroom sneering.Although Gu Qiuze was the eldest son of the Gu family, he still had an elder sister who was very powerful. Unlike the only successor of the Lu family, Gu Qiuze was subject to more restrictions and arrangements.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know the conversation outside the classroom. She was busy preparing for today\u2019s study schedule.Since the senior students would be joining today, the teachers won\u2019t be ruthlessly teaching.First of all, they introduced the great achievements of the seniors and sisters. Then they shared their learning experience one by one. Finally, all the students were divided into several groups, each with a senior to answer questions.The names of the groups were arranged immediately by the teacher. Chu Yin and Lu Zhen were put in the same group.They were assigned to Gu Qiuze.Xueji: \u201cIt must be fate.\u201dChu Yin sneered: \u201cThis is the arrangement of the stupid script.\u201dBut it\u2019s okay, as long as it didn\u2019t affect her study, everything else would be fine.All the other girls in the class looked at their group with envy \u2013 My god! What kind of luck is this? Two handsome guys are in their group. Why can\u2019t they share it equally!Han Chuying also looked at them with envy. They can appreciate the beauty of Chu Yin up close!This class only issued a set of questions that required heavy logic. The seniors of each group were always on call to share their experiences with the winter camp students.Lu Zhen sat in front of Chu Yin. After she got the question, she didn\u2019t care about others and began to answer it.Gu Qiuze walked around the table around Chu Yin and bowed slightly: \u201cCan you do it? Do you need me to teach you?\u201dThe girls all made envious noises while those top student boys who spoke to Chu Yin before were all ashamed.The gentle and kind senior, the innocent and beautiful schoolgirl, seemed to be a match made in heaven.Chu Yin pursed her lips. She noticed Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze towards her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I can do it.\u201dGu Qiuze laughed and said nothing more. He turned to supervise other students.Chu Yin hoped that she could finish all the questions in one breath. But today\u2019s paper was really difficult. After finishing two problems, she got stuck again.After a while, she caught a glimpse of Gu Qiuze coming towards her again. She tried to pretend she was doing well.But suddenly, the desk in front of her was slammed by a pair of well-defined hands.The young man\u2019s cold voice rang out: \u201cI\u2019ll teach you.\u201dChu Yin immediately raised her eyes.Lu Zhen was quietly looking at her.Chu Yin\u2019s face tightened as she thought: You! With! What! What!!I\u2019m in third, you\u2019re fourth, OK! Dog man!!\u2014Lu Zhen seemed to understand the meaning behind her eyes. His lips hooked, saying, \u201cI solved the eight problem.\u201dAt this time, Gu Qiuze came over and said in a warm voice, \u201cWhich one? I\u2019ll do it.\u201dFor a moment, the eyes of the whole classroom were focused on them.At the same time, Chu Yin, who was guided by these two handsome men, became the focus of the whole audience.Chu Yin: I knew it\u2026The dog man was probably annoyed by Gu Qiuze, so he deliberately wanted to teach her \u2013 this elementary school kid\u00a01\u00a0!!!Lu Zhen turned the pen with his slender fingers. He looked at Gu Qiuze and said with a smile, \u201cNo need.\u201dGu Qiuze\u2019s eyebrow was raised. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t be afraid to trouble me. We were invited because of this.\u201dAlthough his words were not harsh, people on the scene could feel the discord between these two men.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? They know each other?\u201d\u201cIt seems that Gu Qiuze and Lu Zhen belong to the same school\u2026\u201d\u201cIt seems that the relationship is not good right?\u201dLu Zhen sneered: \u201cI don\u2019t need you to teach her.\u201dGu Qiuze smiled: \u201cBut if you teach, can you guarantee it\u2019s correct?\u201dWhile the two men refused to surrender, the other students also dared not to disrupt the atmosphere. The class teachers also did not dare to provoke these two young masters.Chu Yin looked at them and felt tired.\u2014Stop it! Stop fighting! Don\u2019t fight anymore!All men are elementary school kids!If this went on, these students would lose interest in math problems.Chu Yin felt exhausted so she opened the script.\u3010Location: H University\u2019s Classroom. Characters: Lu Zhen, Gu Qiuze. \u3011\u3010Lu Zhen and Gu Qiuze collided against each other. They didn\u2019t agree with each other.Lu Zhen sneered: \u201cIf I can\u2019t guarantee, you will teach me?\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201cYes, as long as you listen.\u201d \u3011\u3010Next, Gu Qiuze gave Lu Zhen tit-for-tat teaching. The surrounding students all watched them pretending to be extremely harmonious.\u3011Chu Yin grasped the light pen expressionlessly and scratched the tit-for-tat.Xueji: \u201cLet me guess. You\u2019ll change it into an antonym! For example\u2013 \u201cXueji: \u201cRespect-each-other\u00a02?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c???\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a description of husband and wife, okay?\u201d It is not so bad though??Xueji: \u201cOh.\u201dShe then replaced it with [love] on the crossed-out word.\u2014\u2014Teaching of loveSmelly men, you two have fun. Let me study hard.In the classroom.Lu Zhen\u2019s black eyes glared at Gu Qiuze: \u201cIf I can\u2019t guarantee, you will teach me?\u201dGu Qiuze smiled: \u201cYes, as long as you listen.\u201dWith that, he went to Lu Zhen and was ready to explain the problem to him.Lu Zhen\u2019s face showed irritation. The anger in his eyes could not be covered up at all.It seemed that a fight would break out anytime between them.Gu Qiuze lowered his head and his fingertips fell on the paper.Just at this time, he suddenly became a spring breeze: \u201cCome on, classmate Lu, let\u2019s look at this problem~~\u201dTender as if with love.Lu Zhen\u2019s hand trembled. The four-digit priced pen between his fingers fell directly to the ground.He looked at Gu Qiuze in shock.Why did you suddenly become coquettish?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)T/N: Hello, my dear ISMF readers! (\u2727\u00d7\u2727) I desperately need a new proofreader for this series since Mary will be busy IRL. \u0f3c\u2006 \u0900\u0e37\u0ebb\u0f40\u2006 \u0900\u0e37\u0ebb\u0f3d I have translated until chapter 49 so if you want to help this poor translator, you can read until the latest chapter I translated.

Can you understand what I just said?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat you\u2019ve done is right. Just keep doing this~~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s body showed his obvious rejection.His thin lips were tight, his eyebrows were folded, and his limbs were as far away as possible from Gu Qiuze.Endure it, Lu Zhen.\u00a01Chu Yin bowed her head to do the math problems. Her face was tranquil. It was as if this matter did not concern her.Her heart suddenly felt a trace of regret because of the script. It was written as a unilateral line of \u2018Gu Qiuze teaching Lu Zhen\u2019, but if the dog man Lu Zhen also took the initiative, it could become a picture of loving each other! Ah!After Gu Qiuze dutifully finished the topic, he also felt very strange.Even though he felt the urge to fight with Lu Zhen in public, he couldn\u2019t understand why he suddenly became gentle.What\u2019s going on?Gu Qiuze was indeed a person known for his gentleness. But this gentleness had never been aimed at Lu Zhen. He had no intention to begin with.But inexplicably, as soon as the words left his mouth, they automatically became very kind.Has he matured to such an extent?The whole class silently lowered their heads, pretending they only had learning in mind.In the other group, Han Chuying looked at this scene that suddenly became emotional and was very satisfied.Men should play with each other! Leave my beautiful sister alone!Yeah!So, in the next two hours, Chu Yin finally got what she wanted and finished it quietly.After a friendly interaction between the two elementary school kids, they finally behaved. They didn\u2019t bother her anymore.Nice..With the experience of sharing and teaching as the dividing line, the winter camp had entered the final stage.All the lessons they learned would reflect in the final assessment questions. After the final level test and final evaluation, the winter cup qualification results would be posted.They would be competing for the standing of gold, silver, and bronze medals this year.\u201cDing~ another system task! After passing the final evaluation, you will be qualified for the [Hope Cup Qualification] with a three and a half degree of difficulty. After that, you can get permission to change a single sentence~\u201dChu Yin waited for a while and found that the system didn\u2019t release any more tasks, \u201cWait, why is there no special reward? And how are the rewards lower than the level test?\u201dXueji: Why are you questioning the rewards!A certain host gave herself buffs and made herself too powerful!She became so powerful that the whole system adjusted her assessment. The top five in the last proficiency tests had a difficulty degree of four stars. The host did not exert too much effort to get third place. Therefore, this task\u2019s reward was greatly reduced.\u201cAnd because the host is too strong, the system judges that this task is easier for you, so there is no special reward card~\u201d\u201cBesides, I would like to remind you that there are two props cards in the host\u2019s account ~ remember to use them within the warranty period~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThis stingy chicken!!!Although these prop cards were useless, this kind of good thing would never be too much ah!\u201cYou\u2019re getting more and more stingy.\u201dXueji: \u201cThe wind is strong, the signal is bad\u2026can\u2019t hear you clearly\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYou want a fucking signal!\u201dShe also knew that it wasn\u2019t difficult for her to get the qualification.There are a total of ten people who could qualify for the competition. She was doing very well now. After completing the questions, she could even find time to coach Han Chuying.Han Chuying had no ambition for this qualification, but she was very active and progressive in her learning!!She appreciated Chu Yin\u2019s high-definition beautiful face and super high logic teaching.Who can enjoy this treatment except her!! Who can!!After so many days of getting along, Han Chuying felt that her friendship with Chu Yin made some progress! When the next semester begins, she would probably become the envy of many people. Ah, this winter camp was just right!In the next few days, the teachers would stop teaching. The students would then be left to review by themselves.After the initial testing, the campers had made rapid progress.Among these people, Chu Yin\u2019s foundation was not the best, but her progress speed was the fastest.She worked hard enough. Her ability to understand and apply knowledge was improving. In the last few classes, her speed could even beat Wang lei, the first in the whole camp, which made many teachers deeply impressed by Chu Yin.The teachers didn\u2019t have any prejudice against Chu Yin because of her outstanding appearance. At the end of the discussion, Chu Yin would sometimes stay in the classroom to continue studying. Some teachers were even willing to take the initiative to stay and tutor her alone for a while.In this regard, Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help but seize the opportunity to ask the teacher about the math exercises during the day.Outside the classroom, the administration teacher looked at the tall and handsome young man in front of him: \u201cYoung Master Lu, Mr. Jiang has researched the models mentioned today. She is tutoring the girl in your school now. If you want, you can listen to it together. \u201cLu Zhen glanced into the classroom.The young girl sat in the middle of the classroom. Her figure was very small. The afterglow of the setting sun filled her shoulders. Although her side profile was blurred by the sun\u2019s warmth, Lu Zhen knew that her expression was serious and focused.He had silently seen her countless times like this.\u201cNo.\u201d Lu Zhen said softly.Let her study hard.Don\u2019t bother her.\u2026Finally, the campers reached the final evaluation.After finishing a set of extremely difficult papers, they would be questioned independently. After a whole day of tension, the journey came to an end.Han Chuying walked out of the classroom. She said to Chu Yin as she collapsed on the bench: \u201cIt\u2019s finally over!\u201dChu Yin breathed softly as she stood looking up at the sky.Now there was no need to think about the result. The knowledge she learned in the past made her feel secure and at ease.Chapter 36 \u2013 I got it! (2)This journey was something she had not experienced in her previous life.Things change and disappear. Only knowledge could be your own and your lifelong aid.Chu Yin thought that the knowledge she had learned in her last life was because of Lu Zhen.But these things she had in this life were all thanks to herself.Xueji chimed in her head: \u201cAnd the system.\u201dChu Yin laughed: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dThis golden finger system was indeed a big motivation for her learning.The final evaluation results would be announced at the graduation ceremony tomorrow. They were given a day to relax.It would also be their last night to stay in the dormitory. This time, they didn\u2019t need to stay up to study but rather they could pack their bags to move out tomorrow.Song Zhaolin sent a lonely WeChat message:[Sister Yin! It\u2019s now over! Do you want to play!][It\u2019s so fun here. Sister Yin, even if you\u2019re not interested in me, there\u2019s still Brother Zhen!][Sexy handsome guy! Play with us!]Chu Yin calmly replied: [Be careful, I\u2019ll expose the screenshot.]Song Zhaolin: [Dad!!!! Spare me!! *panic* *panic* *panic*]Chu Yin: [I don\u2019t have a silly son like you.]She didn\u2019t even add Lu Zhen in WeChat, OK?Chu Yin shook her head. Song Zhaolin was the most naive person she had ever seen.In the hotel, Song Zhaolin put down his phone and sighed, \u201cAh! I can\u2019t convince her to see us.\u201dLu Zhen sat in the leather chair with his slender legs on his knees and his hand supporting his temple.\u00a0 \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201dSong Zhaolin guiltily said, \u201cNothing, nothing.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows raised, \u201cShow me.\u201dSong Zhaolin hugged his phone to his chest: \u201cNo way!\u201dAfter half a minute.Lu Zhen looked down at the chat record on Song Zhaolin\u2019s phone.After Song Zhaolin sent many convincing and lonely WeChat messages to \u2018NDCY\u2019, she only replied with a single threatening message.With Chu Yin\u2019s usually inhuman tone, Lu Zhen could even imagine her subtle expression on the other side of the screen.After a while, Lu Zhen threw the phone back to Song Zhaolin.Then he couldn\u2019t help clicking on his friend request he sent in the past.Should he send this little nerd a screenshot?Accept my friend request.\u2026In the female dormitory.Han Chuying sat cross-legged on the bed, tidying up the earphone cable, pillow, and some paper balls beside her bed. She sighed with emotion: \u201cI\u2019m still a bit reluctant to leave.\u201dChu Yin sat down to sort out the book, \u201cYes.\u201dTheir female roommate joined their conversation, \u201cMe too.\u201dWhen Chu Yin heard this, she raised her eyes and said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019ll see you again when I have a chance.\u201dHan Chuying added positively, \u201cIt\u2019s fate that we were assigned to the same dormitory. Let\u2019s add each other in WeChat. It\u2019s not bad to know each other.\u201dThe female roommate showed a shy and simple smile as she looked at them: \u201cOkay.\u201dThey chatted with WeChat for a while.Before turning off the light, the female roommate took a look at Chu Yin and said seriously, \u201cYou are really good-looking. You are the first one I have ever seen that is so beautiful yet still working hard.\u201dIn their school, beautiful girls only care about their fashion style. It\u2019s the same with the boys too. For them, having a beautiful face was the only requirement. They would attend school without studying hard.But this girl named Chu Yin was not.Those so-called school\u2019s flowers in their school were not as beautiful as her.After hearing her words, Chu Yin was slightly stunned.She raised her hand to touch the tip of her nose, embarrassingly thinking that she was that kind of girl in her last life. She didn\u2019t like to study and preferred to dress up. She was beautiful, unruly, and valued her reputation.She provoked the wrong people.It turned out that her past self, in the eyes of others, was like this.Chu Yin loved the change she made in herself.She gently smiled, her peach blossom eyes were cunningly beautiful: \u201cMaybe because\u2026I\u2019m older.\u201d\u2026\u2026The next day, the closing ceremony was held as scheduled.The atmosphere was tense as the ranking was slowly being announced. The organizer made it more exciting by announcing it from 10th place. Every student that was called burst out in surprise joy as the audience applauded.After hearing that the eighth place is not her own, Han Chuying gives up and makes salted fish on one side with peace of mind.After hearing that she was not in 8th place, Han Chuying gave up. She became a salted fish\u00a01\u00a0with peace of mind.She fully knew her ability. Since she didn\u2019t rank in eight place, it was impossible to go further.So now, she shifted her attention to other people\u2019s achievements.Their female roommate sat beside her, clenching her fists tightly while looking nervous.Han Chuying patted her fist and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you can do it.\u201dShe nodded stiffly.Seventh, not her. Sixth, not either. Her face grew paler as the rankings were announced. At this time, Chu Yin, who was in front of Han Chuying, gently touched the female roommate\u2019s palms.\u201cExtend your hand.\u201d Chu Yin said.She opened her hand subconsciously.Chu Yin put a small mint candy in her palm: \u201cIt will be you, soon.\u201dThe female roommate suddenly raised her head. At this moment, she suddenly heard the teacher announcing her name in the fifth place.She stood up excitedly, her face turning red. Her ranking was even better than she expected!Next to her, Chu Yin smiled lightly as she clapped her hands, sincerely congratulating her.Although Han Chuyin was also among the audience who clapped their hands, she was mostly in a trance.Too much, too much, too much.Chu Yin\u2019s invisible charms are fatal!!!!!\u2013 Ah! Can I also ask her to give me some candy!!Her beauty could even entice both men and women in Huiwen?! Ah, ah ah\u2013When the fourth place was being announced, Chu Yin sat up straight. From this ranking, her name may be called.Wang Lei, Chu Yin, and Lu Zhen were the only top players who had not been announced.Everyone\u2019s eyes were focused on the three of them, even Gu Qiuze showed an expression of interest.There was a little tension in Chu Yin\u2019s heart.Would there be progress? Or would she stay in third place?If she would be called in third place, would it mean that the dog man surpassed her?!Chu Yin reviewed her efforts over the past few days, silently looking forward to second place.The teacher understood the suspense the students were feeling. She smiled as she dragged out her voice, \u201cThen, the third place is\u2014\u201d\u201cLu Zhen! Congratulations.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyes widened.\u2014\u2014She won again!!The joy of victory floated in her heart. Her body seemed to be paralyzed as her smile climbed up from the bottom of her eyes.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t care about the rankings. He got up and went on stage to receive the prize. He also looked flat when facing the camera.But after returning to his seat, Lu Zhen turned his head slightly and saw the slightly bulging apple cheeks of Chu Yin as she laughed\u00a02.He suddenly wanted to laugh, too.Chu Yin was satisfied and waited for the teacher to announce her name.\u201cThe second is also a famous student in the winter camp! Everyone is familiar with this name.\u201d The teacher blinked and read out: \u201cThe second place goes to\u2014Wang Lei!\u201dThere was a commotion in the scene \u2013 the most intelligent student in the camp is ranked second?!Han Chuying was stunned, then suddenly grabbed Chu Yin\u2019s arm excitedly: \u201cYin Yin! You are the first place!\u201dChu Yin was also startled.She knew that she had made a lot of progress, but did not expect that she would place first.\u201cNow everyone can guess who the first place is? \u2013 Yes! She is Chu Yin from Huiwen Private Middle School! Congratulations! Everyone Applaus!\u201dAs soon as the voice fell, the whole lecture hall burst into thunderous applause.Chu Yin took a deep breath, stood up, and walked to the podium in the eyes of countless people.After receiving the certificate of completion from the teacher, Chu Yin turned to face the camera and countless envious faces. She showed a genuine smile, just like a blooming flower.It\u2019s great to learn.\u201cDing \u2013 congratulations to the host for completing the task and getting the [Qualification for the Hope Cup]. You received the [modify sentence] permission~\u201d\u201cKnowledge changes fate, learning can break everything~Host, you are really great~\u201dT/N: Hello, my dear ISMF readers!\u00a0=\uff3e\u25cf \u22cf \u25cf\uff3e= Chris and Jin volunteered to proofread so yayyyy!! <3Chapter 36 \u2013 I got it! (3)Gu Qiuze stood in the corner, smiling and clapping. He now realized that Chu Yin\u2019s competition results could even surpass him.Lu Zhen raised his chin slightly. As his eyes fell on the smiling girl, the corners of his lips curled up.Great, great.At this point, Chu Yin\u2019s winter camp journey drew a complete end.Huiwen Private Middle School won a total of two medals, which was considered an excellent achievement for the school.Chu Shi had known the news of his little sister\u2019s first place through Gu Qiuze.Chu Yin felt like she won a battle after being bombarded by numerous WeChat messages from him. But she was still in a good mood.Han Chuyin stayed with her relatives in B province for two days, so she couldn\u2019t go back with Chu Yin.Chu Yin was fine with it since she already traveled alone to B province when the Winter Camp just started.Thinking like this, Chu Yin took a taxi to the airport. As soon as she entered the lobby, she saw three familiar faces.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dLu Zhen, Gu Qiuze, and Song Zhaolin all looked at her.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026Hi.\u201dWhat a coincidence.Coincidence, coincidence \u2013 you\u2019re a coincidence!Chu Yin silently dragged her luggage to change the boarding pass. Three people stood behind her in a line. It seemed that everyone was on the same flight and in the same business class.Song Zhaolin consciously began to convince: \u201cSister, sister Yin, would you like to sit with me?\u201dChu Yin smiled gently: \u201cShut up.\u201dShe went to the check-in counter, handed her ID card, and chose a window seat.Gu Qiuze walked behind her and helped her lift the bag to the conveyor belt. Then he waved his mobile phone with a smile: \u201cXiao Yin, your brother told me to take care of you, so do you want to sit with me?\u201dThe check-in staff breathlessly looked at the handsome face. They wanted to agree on behalf of the little girl.The little girl hadn\u2019t replied yet when suddenly a handsome and cold-expressionless face appeared behind her.Staff: \u201c!!!\u201dLu Zhen looked down at Chu Yin.He then squinted at Gu Qiuze indifferently and said with an impatient expression. \u201cYou sit with me\u00a01.\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c?\u201dStaff: \u201c?\u201dDid they misunderstand something???Ten minutes later, everyone changed their boarding passes.Chu Yin sat by herself, Song Zhaolin sat by himself, Lu Zhen and Gu Qiuze sat together.Chu Yin sincerely said, \u201cYour relationship is really good.\u201dAs expected of the two people who had been taught by love! Chu Yin thought with satisfaction.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter boarding the plane, the business class was still relatively empty. Although they weren\u2019t sitting together, they were not far apart.Gu Qiuze turned over and looked at Chu Yin: \u201cLittle Yin, don\u2019t you look at your phone? How about accepting my friend request?\u201dThe indifferent Young Master Lu suddenly changed his posture.It turned out he was not the only one who wasn\u2019t added.\u201cOh, I forgot.\u201d Chu Yin cursed inwardly.It would be difficult for her to refuse when she was called out like this. She didn\u2019t accept Lu Zhen\u2019s friend request. If she only accepted Gu Qiuze at this time, it would seem strange and special.Lu Zhen is a dog man. If she deliberately showed special rejection, his interest would grow instead.Chu Yin helplessly said, \u201cI\u2019ll add you once I get off the plane.\u201dThe journey was short. After more than two hours, the plane landed on the apron.The Lu family bowed respectfully, opened the door, and waited for the young master. The situation of the Gu family was similar.As soon as Chu Yin saw her brother\u2019s face, she walked over with a smile.Only Song Zhaolin had a mourning look on his face.Chu Yin finally met the legendary older brother of Song Zhaolin. He was unexpectedly handsome. With a cold temperament and calm eyes, he directly nudged Song Zhaolin, who had been wandering for many days, back into the car.Chu Yin gleefully rushed to the leaving luxury car and waved.After seeing Lu Zhen outside the airport, Chu Shi quickly abducted his sister.\u201cAre you tired? Were you overworked?\u201dIn the car, Chu Shi looked at Chu Yin as his eyebrows twisted, \u201cHow did you become thinner?\u201dChu Yin said with a smile, \u201cWhy do you exaggerate? The food in H university is really good.\u201dChu Shi: \u201cYou didn\u2019t reply to all my WeChat messages. That scared me, thinking you were captured by bad people.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cThere are no bad people.\u201dAfter being reminded, she remembered that she hadn\u2019t turned on her phone yet. After she did, a pile of WeChat messages popped out. She subsequently went to the friend requests area after clicking all the little red dots.One was called GQZ and the other was called Z, the style was exactly the same.Seriously, are you two not really a couple??The seed of love that Chu Yin planted would probably bloom.On the other side of the speeding car, Lu Zhen stared at his mobile phone and saw the newly added dialog box. His dark eyes showed a hint of joy.[I passed your friend verification request, now we can start chatting.]Lu Zhen\u2019s heart was slightly hot.After a long time, his eyes fell on the abbreviations of Chu Yin\u2019s name, and his eyelashes shook slightly.\u2026\u2026Song Zhaolin endured an afternoon of being disciplined at home.After his brother finished, he listened to his father\u2019s discipline, then his mother\u2019s discipline. Song Zhaolin was nagged to death, that he began to reflect on his actions.After being educated, Song Zhaolin went back to his room and cried to his friends.He first cried and howled about his bitter experience with Tan Ke, and then planned to find Brother Zhen.He opened his message list and couldn\u2019t find the name Lu Zhen.After a long time, he found Lu Zhen through his display picture and circle of friends.\u2014Why did you change your name??RNDD\uff1fWhat does this mean??For a moment, Song Zhaolin forgot his original intention of crying. He sent a message to Lu Zhen: [Brother Zhen, what does your WeChat name mean?]When Lu Zhen\u2019s mobile phone vibrated, he opened and read it.What do these four letters mean?NDCY\u3002 Because someone wants to be a father.If she\u2019s really that wild.Then\u2014RNDD\u00a02. Let you be a father.Lu Zhen did not respond for a while.Lu Zhen: [Chatterbox\u00a03\u00a0?][Brother Zhen, you\u2019re not talking about me, are you?][I know I talk a bit too much, but am I not cute? *grief*]Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201d[No.]Song Zhaolin: [Oh, that\u2019s good.][What does it mean?? What is it?]Lu Zhen didn\u2019t reply to him.Song Zhaolin gradually became quiet, as if he had given up with his guesses.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t bother with him anymore.But after a few minutes, Song Zhaolin suddenly sent another WeChat[I know now!!!] He seemed excited.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart tightened for a second without any reason.Then would she know?Soon, a new WeChat popped up:[I see! It means -][I\u2019m your brother\u00a04\u00a0!!!]Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201d[hahahaha! What a good meaning!]Lu Zhen ended the chat.The author has something to say: that night, Song Zhaolin changed his name to KALL\u00a05\u00a0(Lovely LinLin)Song Zhaolin: Brother Zhen, Brother Zhen, look at my name and your name!Lu Zhen: (moved this person into the blocklist.)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am Not Fit to Be the Male Lead\u2019s First LoveCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 \u2013 My popular sister (1)The parents of the Chu family were not present. Chu Yin had not seen them since she came home from B province.Their biological daughter had been away for ten years and she had only been at home for more than half a year. They should have some guilty conscience as her parents. Since Chu Yin never made the effort to be close to them, their feelings of concern gradually faded after seeing that Chu Yin was having a good life.Of course, they didn\u2019t have any intention of throwing a celebration banquet for Chu Yin. They were probably too busy arranging the engagement with the Chen family. Chu Yin didn\u2019t care about either of these.Because the marriage was settled, Chu Qiuqiu felt that she was above Chu Yin. When she learned that Chu Yin won first place in the winter camp, she sincerely congratulated her with a smile, which was rare.\u201cSister, you study so well. When you just came back from the countryside, I was worried that you wouldn\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201dChu Yin heard this line too many times from Fu Mingxuan.She replied, \u201cSister, I\u2019m flattered. I also envy your good judgment.\u201dChu Qiuqiu looked very proud.What\u2019s the use of Chu Yin envying her now? Chu Qiuqiu had already grasped the opportunity with her hand!Although Chen Xuanyuan was not very good and would occasionally act strangely, his appearance and family background were both good. Chu Qiuqiu could already predict her enviable future.Even if Chu Yin regretted it now, she (CQ) would never let her (CY) snatch the opportunity again. Chu Qiuqiu often visited the Chen family while Chu Yin was at the winter camp. Now, the Chen family had started to treat her like their daughter-in-law.Looking at her expression, Chu Yin could guess what went through Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s brain just now.She smiled while sincerely wishing:\u00a0I hope you and Chen Xuanyuan can break away from the plot and grow old together! Best wishes!\u2026Chen family.Chen Xuanyuan sat in the living room, shouting: \u201cI want her!\u201dFather Chen slapped his shoulder, \u201cDon\u2019t shout!\u201dHe now had psychological trauma from Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s shouting incident.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Qiuqiu? Well-behaved, beautiful, and sensible!\u201d Father Chen looked serious. \u201cWhen you suddenly yelled at the banquet that day, Chu Yin avoided you. It was only Chu Qiuqiu who didn\u2019t show any change in attitude! A girl this cultured and sensible is suitable to be the young lady of the Chen family!\u201d\u2013But!Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s face showed pain.But why would that woman still linger in his mind!Why!?\u2014\u2014No! He would never fall in love with a woman so easily!Chen Xuanyuan showed a struggled expression. He sneered, \u201cCould it be that I, Xuanyuan\u2013\u201d\u201cChen Qiang! Give me some damn peace!\u201d Father Chen finally got angry and purposely called out his son\u2019s name from before their family was rich. \u201cDon\u2019t think you\u2019re powerful just because you changed your name to Xuanyuan! I have the final say in this family!\u201dChen Xuanyuan returned to his sane mind, \u201cI understand.\u201dBut somewhere in his heart, he still felt pain.Damn it!!Although Chinese New Year was approaching ever since returning from the winter camp, the Chu family had no sense of time at all.The Chu parents have been extremely busy recently. They didn\u2019t go home until New Year\u2019s Eve. The whole family only had a New Year\u2019s Eve dinner delivered from the hotel.Chu Yin rarely paid attention to the expressions of her parents. When she noticed it, she saw that they were worried.They shouldn\u2019t be worried. The marriage between Chen and Chu was under negotiation already. According to her memory in her last life, this time should be the rising period of the Chu family.Weird.The Chu parents would not mention the problem. So, Chu Yin would not take the initiative to ask. Since she won first place in the winter camp, she must get the gold medal in the upcoming exam. For this reason, she should not slack off in her studying, even if it was New Year\u2019s Eve.After eating, Chu Yin refused her brother\u2019s invitation and directly went upstairs to her room.Just when she opened her exercise book, her phone screen suddenly lit up. Chu Yin opened it and found that there were many unread WeChat messages. All of them were Chinese New Year greetings from her friends.Jiang Yan: [Happy New Year! I miss you! ]Han Chuying: [Beauty! The new year will be more and more beautiful!]Song Zhaolin: [Happy new year, Sister Yin ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!!!! PS: This is not a mass text message!!!]Gu Qiuze: [Happy New Year ~]Chu Yin answered the greetings one by one with a smile.In addition to those greetings, there were random messages from her classmates. Although Chu Yin didn\u2019t post to WeChat moments or chat with people, many of her classmates in Class 5 still asked for her WeChat through Song Zhaolin and Jiang Yan.Scrolling down through the notifications, there was still one unread message. Chu Yin squinted at the username. She couldn\u2019t seem to remember that she added a person with this kind of name?Rndd?The display picture was a little familiar\u2013the corner of the building, black and white.Rndd: [Happy New Year. Study hard.]It was a simple and peaceful greeting. No redundancy at all. This contact\u2019s circle of friends was cleaner than hers, so she couldn\u2019t guess who it was.Chu Yin subconsciously typed these letters \u2013 the abbreviation had a kind of inexplicable magic. The more you can\u2019t guess the meaning, the more you want to guess it.Moreover, this was a good way to expose this user\u2019s language skills.Chu Yin broke down the letters one by one: R, N, D, D and guessed it was: I\u2019ll be your father.She let go of her phone blankly.No, I don\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m not so vulgar!!!Chu Yin blankly picked up her phone again and replied politely, \u201cThank you. You too.\u201dThen she looked at her phone. The user appeared in a green dialogue\u00a01Sent \u221aChu Yin: \u201c\u2026???\u201dNo matter who this WeChat friend was, it\u2019s too much for a father of someone to have this kind of free time during New Year\u2019s?Chu Yin quickly held down the dialog box, trying to avoid it.But the other side seemed to have eyes on the phone and replied in seconds!Rndd: [Your reply is too unenthusiastic.]Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026..\u201dAt this moment, her eyes suddenly fell on the \u2018new friends\u2019 section. When she came back from B province, she added two people in total. Just now, she was also redirected to Gu Qiuze\u2019s moments.So this is Lu Zhen.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026.damn it.\u201dShe can\u2019t scold this dog man. He\u2019ll like it if she scolds him. Her good student character can\u2019t collapse yet!Chu Yin calmed herself before replying: [Wrong number. Sorry. Happy New Year.]Lu Zhen replied in seconds. [It doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t mind if you sent it by mistake.]Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin directly turned off her phone, puffed her face, and calmed her emotions by answering her workbook.\u2026\u2026On the other side in the Lu family\u2019s mansion, Lu Zhen stared at his phone for a long time. After confirming that she won\u2019t reply, he locked the screen and placed it aside.Then he realized that his heartbeat was beating fast.Her reply was the only fireworks that made his new year\u2019s night.The villa area was very quiet. The only sound that could be heard was the faint firecrackers from the distance.Chapter 37 \u2013 My popular sister (2)Lu Zhen\u2019s father had passed away. His mother was away. And Grandfather Lu had slept early. The Lu family, which was the envy of many, was just an ordinary family in this new year.Lu Zhen stared in the direction of the Chu family\u2019s house outside the window for a while.She probably can\u2019t guess.Whenever she worked on her questions, time always seemed to pass quickly. Chu Yin was self-disciplined at home. She went to bed early and got up early. She answered questions while eating three meals a day. In a blink of an eye, it was the day of the Hope Cup Competition.They had to go to the neighboring province to participate in the training camp. But for the final competition, they only needed to go to the provincial examination center. The examination papers of all the participants would be directly distributed to each examination center.Coincidentally, this year\u2019s test center would be held in the neighboring school of Huiwen\u2019s Private School. The journey was convenient.Chu Yin was looking forward to the examination- because the reward of this task might be the highest authority that Chu Yin could have access to.Xueji: \u201cDing ~ releasing a big task \u2013 win the gold medal in the Hope Cup mathematics competition. This has a difficulty degree of five stars. After the task is successful, you can get permission to change a single paragraph!!]Chu Yin\u2019s eyes lit up \u2013 the authority extended to a whole paragraph!This meant she could control a wide range of the plot. In the past, she could only change a sentence at most. The plot following the change is random and she couldn\u2019t control the result.But now, changing a whole scene\u2026she could control the cause, process, result of things, and make them go in the direction she wanted.Chu Yin was ready.\u2014\u2014Gold medal! Go, go, go!On the day of the exam, to ensure today\u2019s success, Chu Yin unlocked the script in advance. The dog man didn\u2019t have a role, and the little gangsters in the neighboring school that liked to play with poop didn\u2019t have any roles either.Perfect.As a large school with a big test center, this school not only had senior high school contestants but also some junior student contestants. The entrance of the school was busy and crowded.Chu Yin asked the driver to go to an area a distance away from the school gate. She squinted outside the crowd to see her examination room and seat number on the bulletin board. She pulled away from the crowd and directly went to the examination room.After checking her ID card and supplies, Chu Yin came into the classroom and sat down.Before long, Lu Zhen also walked into the same classroom.After the proctor\u2019s inspection, Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes looked over Chu Yin, who was sitting against the wall.Since the end of the winter camp, they hadn\u2019t seen each other for about a month. Her hair had grown a bit and she wore a beige sweater, which looked very soft.As if noticing his gaze, Chu Yin\u2019s nose wrinkled imperceptibly.The corners of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips couldn\u2019t help but curve upward. After all, he didn\u2019t want to affect her game state, so he quickly looked away.Five minutes before the start of the exam, the proctor opened the sealed paper and began to distribute it. Chu Yin clenched the pen in her hand and took a deep breath before slowly exhaling. She then sank herself in after getting the paper.She would finally see the results of all her efforts today. Her solid knowledge and strong logical deduction made her invincible as she answered the questions.After two hours.The bell rang, signaling the end of the exam. Chu Yin put the cap on her pen, leaned back in the chair, and breathed a sigh of relief.Although school was about to start, Chu Yin felt like she was finally on winter vacation.It was the most fulfilling holiday of her life.After the paper was put away, Chu Yin grabbed her backpack and slowly walked out of the school.More people were waiting outside the examination room. After looking carefully, she realized that those people were from the TV stations. They carried cameras and were enthusiastically interviewing students who were passing by.Chu Yin half-covered her face and walked silently on the other side.But the people in the TV station seemed to have eagle eyes. At one glance, they saw this girl with an outstanding charm and appearance from the crowd\u2014\u2014Their eyes lit up immediately!In the previous years, they could only see beautiful candidates in art examinations. They didn\u2019t expect to see a beautiful candidate in the math competition.After they immediately abandoned the students wearing red scarves, they rushed to Chu Yin with their long and heavy cameras.Chu Yin didn\u2019t understand the situation after being surrounded. It wasn\u2019t until a pair of sincere eyes and cameras were aimed at her that Chu Yin realized the situation.\u201cClassmate! What grade are you?\u201d\u201cHow difficult are the exam questions this year? How sure do you think you are?\u201d\u201cClassmate! Which school are you from? Are you the school\u2019s flower? You are so talented and beautiful!\u201dChu Yin was silent.The environment made her feel uncomfortable.Although these reporters had no malice, Chu Yin knew clearly that they came because of her face.If her photo were to be taken, it would be very eye-catching in the newspapers. But her strength and efforts would be marginalized.At this time, Chu Yin didn\u2019t dare to change the script so she had no choice but to break from the crowd of reporters.Just then, a cold and indifferent voice sounded from behind, \u201cLet go of her.\u201dA tall figure appeared in front of Chu Yin. He stood straight, blocking all the cameras towards her.The reporters were surprised again \u2013 what happened this year?!In addition to this most beautiful candidate, there\u2019s also this most handsome candidate?!They excitedly raised their camera and were about to bombard him with questions, but suddenly the young man raised his hand and quickly covered their camera lens. His eyes were cold and fierce, \u201cNo recording.\u201dWhen a single reporter recognized him, his face suddenly changed. He poked his colleagues and whispered something.Soon, the reporters ran away one by one.Lu Zhen turned back and looked down at Chu Yin: \u201cAre you okay?\u201dChu Yin looked at Lu Zhen who was in front of her for a moment.Well, she had to say that Lu Zhen, who was still 17 years old now, looked like a man.\u201cThank you.\u201d She nodded.Lu Zhen\u2019s lips hooked and a little smile appeared at the bottom of his eyes: \u201cShould I say you\u2019re welcome?\u201dThe little nerd who wanted to be a father\u2026is she pretending or is she hiding something?Chu Yin didn\u2019t know what Lu Zhen was thinking, but she suddenly saw that not far behind Lu Zhen was his uncle who was smiling and looking at them.Meeting her eyes, Lu Linyuan gently waved his hand, making a very elegant gesture.Chapter 37 \u2013 My popular sister (3)Chu Yin pointed in that direction and reminded him: \u201cYour uncle is over there.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows moved gently.When he turned back, Lu Linyuan had already come over. He looked at Chu Yin with a gentle smile and said, \u201cWe meet again, little classmate.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cHello.\u201dLu Linyuan then looked at Lu Zhen and said with a smile, \u201cLast time you said she was not a classmate?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cNot really.\u201dLu Linyuan raised his eyebrows and laughed. His eyes then fell on Chu Yin\u2019s face.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to talk to this uncle and nephew pair. Since the reporters had left, she found an excuse to leave too.Lu Zhen did not look at her back, but asked Lu Linyuan flatly: \u201cAre you not busy?\u201dLu Linyuan knew that his meaning was that he appeared too often. He laughed: \u201cI have to care about you even when I\u2019m busy.\u201dAfter a pause, he said with a slight smile, \u201cBut I came today with a purpose.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Linyuan said with a smile: \u201cThe will of the old man. He wanted me to take you to see your mother.\u201dLu Zhen was taken aback. After a few seconds, his eyes gently lowered.\u2026\u2026Because there were too many people outside the examination room, the family car was surrounded. Chu Yin asked her driver to drive forward as she walked to another street to get in the car.Not far away, Chu Yin suddenly saw a familiar face in the car by the side of the road.Song Yanchuan propped up his head with one hand. When she hesitated to look over, he raised his eyelids slightly.\u2014\u2014\u201dLittle sister.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c??\u201dIsn\u2019t this Lin Lin\u2019s elder brother? Should they know each other?Maybe because Song Zhaolin babbled so much about his elder brother\u2019s image to her so in her heart, he was depicted as a violent, muscular man. Although he had washed away that impression at the airport last time, Chu Yin still felt a little fear when she looked at him.She carefully stopped a few meters away and politely responded, \u201cHello.\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s eyes fell on the car in front of them. Then he glanced at her and said, \u201cBe safe. Don\u2019t talk to strangers.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026?\u201dAren\u2019t you a stranger???Song Yanchuan\u2019s action today was entirely due to the second brother in their family who would always fangirl about Chu Yin every day.After reminding her, Song Yanchuan\u2019s kindness was now used up. He turned the steering wheel and drove away indifferently.It took Chu Yin a long time to remember.Looking at the relationship between Song Zhaolin and Lu Zhen, she could see that the Lu family and the Song family were good friends. In her impression, many of the Song family\u2019s properties depended on the Lu family. The Song family was mainly managed by Song Yanchuan.When he appeared here today, did he come with Lu Linyuan or did he come with Lu Zhen?Who was he referring to with his reminder?\u2026The weather was getting warmer in March.Chu Yin took the time to relax during the last few days of winter vacation before the first day of school started.This semester would be the final stage for senior high school students before taking the college entrance exam. Although Chu Shi didn\u2019t take part in the college entrance exam, he was busier than ever in preparing for the application and IELTS exam.When he thought about Chu Yin\u2019s competition results, he knew he would hold a celebration banquet for her regardless of her results.If their parents wouldn\u2019t do it, he would. He had to for his little Yin.Chu Yin\u2019s mind was peaceful. She hoped that the results of the winter camp would come out in a week. On the first day of school, Chu Yin put on her loose Huiwen school uniform.Meanwhile, Chu Qiuqiu looked very well-dressed. She even added a sense of her intellect to her femininity. She seemed to have adapted to her new identity as a fianc\u00e9e.Seeing the familiar rustic dress of Chu Yin, Chu Qiuqiu wanted to say some white-lotus words.But after seeing Chu Yin\u2019s exquisite face and remembering her impeccable achievements, Chu Qiuqiu swallowed her words.Chu Yin: Very good.Control yourself. Don\u2019t say it.The weather was beautiful on their way to school. The students on the roadside were all smiling.This was the life of a student. They like long vacations, but when they see their friends on campus, they would be in a good mood.In her previous life, Chu Yin had no friends at school because her reputation in school was bad. This time was totally different.When she got out of the car at the school gate, many people watched her.\u201cWow, that\u2019s Chu Yin\u2026\u201d\u201cWuwuwuwu\u2026why didn\u2019t she get fat after the Spring Festival? She looks even better!\u201d\u201cQuickly wake me up! I think I\u2019m going crazy. I suddenly wanted to wear a loose school uniform. What\u2019s wrong with me?\u201d\u201cWake up! You can\u2019t dress like that.\u201dChu Yin is slender with a well-proportioned body. She\u2019s 1.7 meters tall. Because of that, the loose school uniform on her looked very high-fashion.Paired with her beautiful face and cold aura, her beautiful face made her even more exquisite.When a student stepped forward to greet Chu Yin, Chu Yin waved casually before walking inside the school building.The student was left frozen with a speechless face.Ah, sister greeted me \u2013 !!!Zheng Yu witnessed the scene of when Chu Yin entered the school gate. He also saw the blushing faces of the boys and girls around him. He felt a sour dissatisfaction.He wasn\u2019t able to win her heart in the beginning. But now that she became famous, it\u2019s even harder for him to win her over.Chu Yin entered Class 5\u2019s classroom.Because of Song Zhaolin\u2019s effort in spreading the winter camp\u2019s result, they all knew that Chu Yin won first place. Seeing her now, they felt the gap between the mortals and immortals.They were just ordinary people.Jiang Yan welcomed her happily: \u201cYin Yin!\u201dChu Yin hadn\u2019t seen her for a long time. She patted her head with a smile, \u201cDid you study hard during the winter vacation?\u201dJiang Yan said with a smile: \u201cOf course! I want to keep up with you.\u201dChu Yin wiped the dusty table and chair with paper. As soon as she sat down, Song Zhaolin rushed in with a gust of wind.\u201cSister Yin ~ ~\u201dChu Yin watched him sit down on the dusty chair. She covered her eyes, \u201cWhen you go to the toilet later, remember to pat your butt.\u201d\u201cAh? Oh\u2013\u201d Song Zhaolin twisted his butt indifferently and asked expectantly, \u201cDo you want the results to come out? I just passed by the office and heard Teacher Wang mention that the awards will be presented directly during the opening ceremony.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s heart beat faster: \u201cReally?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cAs long as you get the silver medal just like Gu Qiuze, you\u2019ll already be getting special treatment. Look at how Gu Qiuze was treated. You\u2019ll be the campus goddess.\u201dAlthough Chu Yin had no interest in being a campus goddess, she wanted to have those medals.Silver was not enough. She wanted gold.Chapter 37 \u2013 My popular sister (4)Not long after, the math class representative came over and called Chu Yin, \u201cClassmate Chu, Teacher Wang asked you to go to the office.\u201dSong Zhaolin and the rest of Class 5 all stared at Chu Yin with bright eyes.\u201cSister Yin, we\u2019ll wait for your good news!\u201d Song Zhaolin made a cheering gesture on his head.In the office, Teacher Wang\u2019s excited expression was beyond words. As soon as she saw Chu Yin, she gave her a strong hug.Her happy voice exploded in Chu Yin\u2019s ear, \u201cGold medal, Chu Yin! You won the gold medal!\u201dAs far as the management department was concerned, it was a rare honor for liberal arts students to win competition prizes.Teacher Wang never expected Chu Yin to win the gold medal after only a short winter vacation! Huiwen hadn\u2019t won a gold medal in Literature and Mathematics in ten years!!All the teachers in the office looked at them and applauded.Chu Yin\u2019s heart was filled with excitement and joy after recovering from the news \u2013 She did it!The International Class\u2019s Math teacher admired her while holding his teacup, \u201cThis child has an unlimited future.\u201dThe teacher next to him said with a smile, \u201cTeacher Chen, the child in your class is also very good. Our school is excellent this year.\u201dA gold medal and a silver medal! It\u2019s a record-breaker!Teacher Wang patted Chu Yin\u2019s shoulder enthusiastically, \u201cWait for the school opening ceremony. The award announcement will happen after the lifting of the national flag. Let the whole school remember your name!\u201dChu Yin laughed: \u201cThank you, teacher.\u201dShe felt overwhelming happiness and an urge to answer ten more sets of questions immediately.How nice to study! She loves learning!!The opening ceremony began at nine o\u2019clock. The students went to the large playground and stood with their class.At this time, everyone\u2019s eyes fell on the figure under the national flag.Chu Yin\u2019s face was calm as her slender figure stood in the warm spring wind. Her brown hair fluttered gently with the wind.After a while, another eye-catching figure stood under the national flag.Lu Zhen walked to her and stopped. The two of them were a little apart, facing the teachers and students of the school side by side.Lu Zhen had a light smile as his clear voice floated in the wind, \u201cCongratulations, good student.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s lips raised silently.For the first time in her life, she stood beside Lu Zhen, calm and even a little happy.Because she knew she was the winner.This time, she firmly pressed Lu Zhen\u2019s head.For a moment, Chu Yin came up with a bizarre idea\u2013 If Lu Zhen was also reborn, how would that crazy and paranoid man behave when he was severely suppressed by her?But it was only for a few seconds. Chu Yin drove away from the terrible idea.She would like Lu Zhen to be like this forever.After the routine process of the school opening ceremony, it was time to present the awards. The awards would be presented by the principal.They first announced Lu Zhen\u2019s result \u2013 The silver medal in this year\u2019s Hope Cup competition! Huiwen\u2019s second silver medal in recent years!In the area where the third-year senior students were, Chu Shi applauded reluctantly.He glared at Gu Qiuze, \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of you! Why can you only tie him!\u201dGu Qiuze: \u201c\u2026??\u201dAll the girls in school were boiling with excitement as Lu Zhen received the prize. They always thought that Lu Zhen only had a good face and that Qiuze was better in terms of intelligence! Now, Lu Zhen also won the silver medal!!But at this time, the attention shifted to the girl who had not yet taken the stage to accept the award.Most of the time, the champions were announced last. Since Lu Zhen won the silver medal, then Chu Yin\u2026\u201cNext, let\u2019s congratulate Chu Yin of second-year class 5 for winning the gold medal in the Hope Cup Mathematics Competition!\u201dThe whole school was in an uproar. Class 5 cheered loudly. Of course, Song Zhaolin alone accounted for 80% of the volume.Now, Chu Yin\u2019s intelligence was announced to the whole school. Her status would be different from her past.The Huiwen students looked between Lu Zhen and Chu Yin who stood on both sides of the principal. They fell into a heated discussion.\u201cWhat to do? I suddenly can\u2019t choose anymore\u2026\u201d\u201cTo tell you the truth, me too\u2026\u201d\u201cOne is my husband and the other is my wife. Is there any problem?\u201d\u201cSo shameless?? I like it!\u201d\u2026\u2026That evening, a post appeared on the Huiwen forum.[Now the school\u2019s flower and school\u2019s apollo can be settled??\u3011The photos taken today were attached to the forum. The two winners who stood in front of the camera looked like a god and goddess.Anonymous 1: Why are so many people fangirling over the current school\u2019s flower?Anonymous 2: +1Anonymous 3: Chu Yin\u2019s legs are slenderAnonymous 4: @3, truly.As soon as the post came out, the forum became lively.Anonymous 20: These days, there are still many people who are sour towards beautiful girls.Anonymous 22: Excuse me, putting both Chu Yin and Lu Zhen side by side is a bit of a mismatch.Anonymous 25: @22, What\u2019s wrong with you? Do you need me to remind you that Chu Yin is the gold medalist and Lu Zhen is the silver medalist?Anonymous 26: Don\u2019t fight! It\u2019s nonsense! I love both of them!!After dozens of replies, there was still a person in the forum who was bitter at Chu Yin.Anonymous 88: Next time if she won another prize, would you all lick her feet?Anonymous 89: @88, Who are you that you dared to say that?Anonymous 90: @89, Why should I reveal my identity?Song Zhaolin angrily held his phone. He was going to blow up. What an idiot!On the other hand, Chu Yin received Han Chuying\u2019s WeChat:[Sister, you\u2019re really famous! The forum is going crazy because of you!][Song Zhaolin is a stinky sister in the forum. His posts are so obvious!1\u00a0I can\u2019t bear to see it!]Chu Yin\u2019s eyebrow raised. This garbage anonymous forum really should be fixed.She found the post and looked at it. After reading it, she refreshed it again. There were two more replies at the bottom.Anonymous 91: You rely on anonymity to talk badly about people here! Believe it or not, we\u2019ll find out your real name!!Anonymous 92: Ha ha, I don\u2019t believe it!Chu Yin: Oh, you don\u2019t believe itShe opened the script, thinking: I want you to look good since you bullied my son. Ha ha.In a minute.The entire anonymous forum had collapsed.After the collapse, everyone saw their real names again\u2014\u2014Anonymous 91 (Song Zhaolin): You rely on anonymity to talk badly about people here! Believe it or not, we\u2019ll find out your real name!!Anonymous 92 (Zheng Yu): Ha ha, I don\u2019t believe it!\u2026\u2026Anonymous 99 (Han Chuying): Hahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahaa!! This is public execution!!Anonymous 100 (Tan Ke): Song Zhaolin?? Have you become a prophet??At this time, Song Zhaolin also covered his mouth in shock.What kind of supernatural phenomenon was this? Do I have a powerful spirit! I\u2019m too strong??He touched his lips as his fingertips trembled \u2013 Has the power inside me finally awakened!?Song Zhaolin excitedly rushed out of the room and met Song Yanchuan who just came back from work.\u201cMy mouth is awesome! I am a prophet!\u201d\u201cBrother, you will become a pig after ten o\u2019clock tonight! Hoo hoo hoo! The black devil will be transforming!\u201dSong Yanchuan looked at him blankly, \u201cProphet?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cYes.\u201dSong Yanchuan: \u201cThen I predict that you will be beaten by me.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cYes.\u201dTen minutes later.Song Zhaolin, with a big bump on his forehead, crouched in the corner and shed tears.Song Yanchuan: Effective \u221aPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a protective cover that could hide their dark and dirty thoughts. It gave those evil people a sense of security.\u2014\u2014But now, the sense of security is gone!!Who would dare talk in a place where your real name could be revealed??At this moment, Zheng Yu felt very humiliated.His remarks and comments were really rude. Combined with his past deeds, his reputation became even worse.In the anonymous group, a bunch of people were talking about the incident.[I\u2019m laughing to death. Hahahaha! Zheng Yu said in the post: Do you want to kneel and lick Chu Yin?][When in fact he was the only one in the school who actually \u201cknelt and licked\u201d.][Hahahahaha!!][Thank you for being laughed at.]The forum wasn\u2019t fixed for a while. Zheng Yu\u2019s remarks were publicly reprimanded in the post.Some students took advantage of this period to confess in the forum:[I hope that my beautiful sister will not be affected! My sister is wonderful QAQ -a freshman younger brother][Pretty senior sister, don\u2019t let this incident affect your mood~]The comments in the forum were surprisingly harmonious, which was completely different from what Chu Yin experienced in her last life.But soon, someone discovered something unusual.[Is it just me? The two times the forum crashed were all posts about Chu Yin!]Anonymous 1: Damn it, really.Anonymous 2: Has anyone seen the past threads? I remember the time Chu Yin\u2019s report card was revealed.Anonymous 3: My mother! Is my sister a child of god?\u2026Anonymous 15: I see! I solved the case! It was Song Zhaolin who had the last comment on those two threads! He is the real son of god!Having just witnessed this prophetic scene, everyone accepted this truth. The whole forum began to worship Song Zhaolin.Anonymous 20: Worship Song Zhaolin! [pray]Anonymous 21: Bless my academic progress this semester [pray]Anonymous 22: True believer here! I\u2019m willing to exchange ten catties of meat for my future husband/wife to fall in love with me!Song Zhaolin, who just got beaten, browsed through his phone while feeling wronged. When he saw the male and female believers he had gathered while he was away from the forum, his silly smile immediately came back.He\u2019s happy once again! It\u2019s so easy to be happy again! Hahaha!\u2026Zheng Yu didn\u2019t show up until the forum was repaired.He felt bad enough. How could it be that the first time he started posting evil comments, he was immediately revealed? And just after he said, \u2018I don\u2019t believe it!\u2019. It\u2019s like someone\u2019s trying to punish him!Zheng Yu fidgeted with his phone for a while. Just then, a new WeChat came in.Chu Shi: [Are you still not ashamed of yourself?][Now do you know why my sister looks down on you?][Because you don\u2019t look like a man at all!]After reading the message, Zheng Yu felt as if he had been strangled.The reason why he minded Chu Yin\u2019s matter was that he was uncomfortable seeing boys trying to pursue Chu Yin. He still hadn\u2019t won her heart yet.After this incident, he didn\u2019t have any chance at all.Chu Shi frowned after sending the WeChat messages to Zheng Yu. He threw his phone aside with a speechless expression.He usually didn\u2019t read the forum. If it hadn\u2019t been for the girl in the same class as him who told him about the incident, he wouldn\u2019t know Zheng Yu had done such a disgraceful thing again.At this time, Chu Shi was playing with a balloon in his hand. Because of his irritation, he popped the balloon with a \u2018bang\u2019Gu Qiuze glanced at him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you want to secretly surprise your sister?\u201dChu Shi was taken aback. He quickly glanced at Chu Yin\u2019s room on the second floor.\u201cI\u2019m pissed off by Zheng Yu\u2019s stupidity.\u201d Chu Shi took the balloon again. \u201cI have to talk to him in school tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBut speaking of that, your sister seems to be protected by the heavens.\u201d Gu Qiuze said.Chu Shi laughed: \u201cThat\u2019s not very good.\u201dThey were almost finished with blowing the balloons and decorating the place with ribbons. Two straight men clumsily decorated the living room of the Chu villa, trying to create a festive atmosphere.After the long and difficult process, the two looked at the new living room.Gu Qiuze: \u201cHmmm..\u201dChu Shi: \u201cHmmm..\u201dHow was the Chu family\u2019s celebration banquet arranged last time??He clearly remembered that it\u2019s almost the same. Why did this look so messy?Chu Shi sighed: \u201cFor my sister\u2019s noble gold medal, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dJust as he was about to tear down the decorations, the door of Chu Yin\u2019s room on the second floor suddenly opened.The two brothers were nervous at the same time!Chu Yin, who was previously in the zone studying, leaned half of her body outside the door. She asked, \u201cDid something explode just now?\u201dGu Qiuze couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cYour reflexes are fast.\u201dChu Yin had heard the sound but she endured her curiosity and only came out after finishing her math question.She wondered why Gu Qiuze was here. After walking downstairs, she looked at the scattered objects in the living room. After a second of silence, she asked with hesitation, \u201cThis\u2026are you setting up the room?\u201dChu Shi covered his face.\u201cWe wanted to hold a celebration banquet for you to congratulate you on winning the gold medal in the competition!\u201dChu Yin blinked.She didn\u2019t expect her brother to really hold a celebration banquet for her.What\u2019s more enjoyable than being honored was that someone remembered and congratulated her on her merits.Although the celebration banquet was a little childish for Chu Yin, who lived for two lifetimes, she cherished her brother\u2019s heart very much.\u201cThank you, brother.\u201d Chu Yin said with a smile.Chu Shi came over and touched her head with a smile.Gu Qiuze stood aside, not taking any credits.Chu Shi prepared a three-tiered cake. Now that Chu Yin came out of her room, he went to the kitchen to get the cake. The servant helped put out other snacks and drinks that filled the table.Chu Shi opened a bottle of wine from the cellar.The wine was drunk by him and Gu Qiuze. Chu Yin was only allowed a glass of coke.***A small party for three people. Although the atmosphere couldn\u2019t compare with the past celebrations, it was still heartily festive.Chu Yin was urged by Chu Shi to cut the cake and blow out the candle. The two men applauded and cheered, which made it seem like countless people were celebrating with her.\u201cCongratulations to Chu Yin, the gold medalist!\u201d\u201cI hope you are happy and healthy every day. The country needs talents like you!\u201dChu Yin pressed her hand: \u201cAlright, let\u2019s calm down.\u201dChu Shi was very happy tonight. Whenever he was happy, he would drink a little too much.\u201cLittle Yin is promising!\u201d After a few cups, Chu Shi\u2019s voice became slurred, \u201cGold medalist! You\u2019re better than Gu Qiuze. Even better than that Lu Zhen \u2013 you\u2019re more powerful than him! No one can do anything to you\u2026\u201dChu Yin sighed: \u201cYou drink less, brother.\u201dChu Shi waved: \u201cI didn\u2019t drink much!\u201dChapter 38 \u2013 Let\u2019s throw up (2)People who drank too much never felt like they drank too much. Her brother\u2019s drinking capacity was shameful.Chu Yin had no choice but to look at Gu Qiuze.Gu Qiuze was also watching. After meeting her eyes, he smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. This wine won\u2019t give him any headaches.\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t care. Her brother was already a grown-up. He can drink whenever he likes.Chu Shi was lying on one side talking to himself, while Gu Qiuze chatted with Chu Yin.\u201cLittle Yin, you study so well. Do you have any plans for the future?\u201dChu Yin took a sip of coke and said, \u201cYes, take part in the college entrance examination.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to go abroad to study?\u201dHe remembered that Chu Yin also won the championship in the English speech contest last semester. According to her level, a 7.5 + IELTS test would be an easy entry for her to study abroad.Chu Yin shook her head: \u201cThere is no plan at the moment.\u201dIf she estimated correctly, the college entrance examination results must be a crucial system task, Chu Yin could not give it up. Besides, staying in this country would be best.She had studied abroad in her previous life. Now, she wanted to experience the feeling of randomly choosing universities within the country! How exciting!Gu Qiuze smiled.Chu Yin\u2019s side profile was very beautiful. There was no superfluous expression. Her peach blossom eyes were black and shiny, showing her firm, unswerving character.She only liked to study and didn\u2019t care about anything else.Gu Qiuze suddenly blinked: \u201cDo you know that there are many people that like you?\u201dChu Yin looked at him in surprise, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dGu Qiuze said with a smile: \u201cNothing \u2013 just suddenly felt that you wouldn\u2019t care about people liking you\u2026no matter who they are?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s nose gently moved, trying to figure out the meaning of Gu Qiuze\u2019s words. In this life, Gu Qiuze didn\u2019t seem to show any signs of liking her, making her very happy. His words were ambiguous as if he wasn\u2019t talking about himself, but more like it meant something else.Seeing the doubts in her eyes, Gu Qiuze laughed and said nothing more.He just thought that a certain arrogant and rebellious bastard would suffer in the future. He couldn\u2019t wait for it.Chu Shi on one side drank too much. No one knew what he was thinking. He waved his arm and murmured: \u201cYin Yin suffered\u2026\u201dHearing this familiar line in her last life, Chu Yin\u2019s heart jumped inexplicably.Just then, the Chu family\u2019s door was pushed open and a group of people came in. It was Father Chu, Mother Chu, and Chu Qiuqiu who had just returned from the Chen family.Seeing the scene in the room, Mother Chu was stunned: \u201cThis is\u2026\u201dChu Shi couldn\u2019t answer, so Gu Qiuze did it for him. He said very clearly: \u201cLittle Yin won the gold medal in the Hope Cup. We are celebrating for her.\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s eyes showed a bit of jealousy as soon as these words came out. Meanwhile, the expressions of the parents showed embarrassment \u2013 no matter the event, there was no reason for outsiders to help their daughter celebrate. When Chu Shi won the prize before, they threw a big celebration banquet.Father Chu laughed twice: \u201cYes! You see, dad has been too busy recently. Congratulations on winning the gold medal!\u201dChu Yin\u2019s expression was light as if she didn\u2019t care about his belated blessing at all, which made the scene more embarrassing for a moment.Gu Qiuze didn\u2019t stay any longer. He left after saying goodbye to the Chu family.Chu Yin and the servant helped Chu Shi back to the room. After feeling like they were carrying a pig, she went downstairs to drink some water.On the way, she happened to pass by her parents\u2019 room. Through the crack of the door, she heard a little quarrel.\u201cAre we going to keep it that way? Really?\u201d\u201cNo, it must be! What else can I do?! This time we must ask for help from the Chen family!\u201d\u201cBut\u2026the new town project\u2026 \u201cChu Yin suddenly paused, her pupils shrank slightly.New town project?If she remembered correctly, this project was contracted by Chu Yin\u2019s family after she went to university. And this project would be the beginning of the Chu family\u2019s downfall.What\u2019s wrong with the Chu family\u2019s business? No wonder they were in such a hurry to marry in with the Chen family.Chu Yin always thought that the bankruptcy of the Chu family was directly related to Lu Zhen. It was he who made the Chu family bankrupt and made her completely lose her fragile shelter so that she could easily fall into his hands. But now, Lu Zhen was still young. He couldn\u2019t control the Lu family as much as his uncle yet.Could it be that the bankruptcy of the Chu family had nothing to do with the dog man??Or maybe because the plot changed so the timeline advanced?Chu Yin went to the kitchen and drank a whole glass of water in silence.Although the bankruptcy was still far away, it seemed she needed to make more plans besides studying.For example, save more money to protect her brother.Huiwen Private Middle School had many activities besides daily courses in the new semester.The news of the April Cultural Festival came out within the first few days of the new semester.Song Zhaolin was restless to begin with. After hearing the announcement, he was even more fidgety.Cultural Festival, to perform on stage!As soon as he excitedly turned, Chu Yin answered without raising her head, \u201cNot interested. Not participating. Don\u2019t ask.\u201dSong Zhaolin vomited blood: In the new semester, she is still so ruthless!\u201cBut you are very popular now, Sister Yin.\u201d Song Zhaolin gestured with his hands. \u201cThere are many people who ask me for your WeChat ID. Many of them!!\u201dChu Yin remained unmoved.Sister is very noble, people have no chance.But Chu Yin didn\u2019t know that Song Zhaolin wasn\u2019t exaggerating. The degree of her popularity directly surpassed other famous figures in school.There were several fans of Chu Yin in the first year class headed by Han Chuying.\u201cDo you think Chu Yin will perform at the festival?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. She looks very cold and only likes to study. I don\u2019t think she wants to prepare for the show.\u201dA classmate next to him said, \u201cThey said Chu Yin couldn\u2019t perform in any show. I admit that she\u2019s beautiful and has good grades. But it doesn\u2019t look like she has any talent\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat talent do you want?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s considered a show even if Chu Yin sits unmovingly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cI\u2019d like to watch it!!\u201dChapter 38 \u2013 Let\u2019s throw up (3)Chu Yin knew nothing and didn\u2019t care about it. Now she had a very distressing problem.\u2013Since she won the gold medal in the competition, it became even more difficult for her to obtain small rewards!In the past, she could get a single word change permission by doing homework. Or she could get a single word change permission by solving a difficult problem. Now all of the tasks have been upgraded!Chu Yin: Damn! This is the result of the big buff!Xueji: YesChu Yin needed to solve four or five difficult problems to get a single word change permission. And it\u2019s a new type of question that she had not encountered before.As a result, Chu Yin was now thirsty for questions. Her curiosity was so strong that the teachers were afraid.She had become more stingy than before. After counting the script-change permissions in her account, she decided to use them cautiously to avoid wasting them.So after class, Chu Yin went to see the teacher again.As soon as she walked out of the corridor, many students glanced at her. Chu Yin was already used to it.She walked towards the teacher\u2019s office. As soon as she passed the corner, she ran into Lu Zhen head-on.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows were raised, \u201cGood morning.\u201dChu Yin stepped back and nodded, \u201cGood morning.\u201dSince the last time she overheard her parents\u2019 conversation, Chu Yin spent a lot of time reviewing the timeline of her previous life. There was a 50% probability that Lu Zhen had nothing to do with the bankruptcy of the Chu family.But what exactly was going on? She was still thinking about the cause.Seeing Lu Zhen at this time, she fell into silent thinking.Since the two famous figures came together, the eyes of the students immediately followed them.\u201cMy God! My husband is talking to my wife!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who I should be jealous of for a moment!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll pay double the price if you give me ears that can hear what they\u2019re talking about!\u201dLu Zhen glanced behind Chu Yin and saw a lot of boys subtly moving their heads, trying to steal a glimpse.He suddenly felt sourness in his mouth as he said with great patience, \u201c\u2026You are so popular.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c???\u201dCould it be that what Song Zhaolin said was true? She was so popular now that Lu Zhen, the dog man, had a sense of crisis??This feels pretty good.But on the surface, Chu Yin maintained her character \u2013 clever and dull. \u201cOh, yes. I don\u2019t care about it.\u201dLu Zhen looked down at her face. The dark eyes hidden in his eyelashes were deep.Are you pretending to be good?Are you only pretending to be like this when you\u2019re in front of me?Lu Zhen\u2019s heart slightly constricted as his fingertips gently curled up. He whispered, \u201cChu Yin, I don\u2019t like\u2026good students.\u201dSubtle and faint. Only he knew\u2026even his tone was slightly tense.But Chu Yin suddenly raised her eyes, pretending to be serious: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m leaving now.\u201dLu Zhen was startled: \u201cNo\u2026\u201dAfter Chu Yin spoke, she immediately slipped away. Her figure was even more lively than usual.That\u2019s right! You read it right! I am!!I\u2019m the type you don\u2019t like! Learning all the way!It seems that her character setting is successful!Yes! Chu Yin wanted to shake her arms and cheer.Lu Zhen looked at her back. It took him a long time to realize that his spine was slightly numb.He leaned against the wall for a long time and smiled helplessly.Can you be more obvious next time?\u00a01The engagement banquet between the Chen family and Chu family was set on Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s birthday.After all, the business marriage was a major event. The two families negotiated for more than a month before finally making a decision.The birthday banquet of the son of the Chen family and also an engagement party of the Chen and Chu family. Naturally, this would be considered an important event. The invitation letters were sent all over the wealthy circles in the city.Recently, Chu Qiuqiu became less of a demon in front of Chu Yin and had focused on her new identity. On the day of the engagement banquet, she felt very proud while watching the rows of famous figures coming in.The Chu family has two daughters. And yet, she was the one who married first. This identity and status were naturally self-evident. Chu Qiuqiu was satisfied.Moreover, there were many classmates in the crowd. She even saw Zheng Yu, a senior who had shown his kindness before.Chu Qiuqiu triumphantly thought as she looked at this famous senior.\u00a0He\u2019s probably sad\u00a02.Because the Chen family offended Lu Zhen a long time ago, they also sent an invitation to the Lu family this time. Although they knew they were not qualified enough to invite Young Master Lu, their sincerity must be expressed.Chu Yin read the script in advance. There was an interesting description that caught her interest.The invitation was delivered to Lu Linyuan. He took it and asked Lu Zhen if he wanted to come. Lu Zhen took a look and coldly refused.This phrase wasn\u2019t the main content. She didn\u2019t know why this was included in the script.However, if Lu Zhen didn\u2019t come, Chu Yin could safely go\u2014\u2014To prevent Chen Xuanyuan, the strange man, from acting like a demon, she had to stand her ground.Even though she didn\u2019t know the specific situation of the Chu family\u2019s business or when the Chu family would go bankrupt, she didn\u2019t want to get involved in Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s affairs.Chen Xuanyuan, Chu Qiuqiu, you two must give it your all! I\u2019ll lock you two together forever!And swallow the key!!!Soon the process of the engagement banquet started. The engaged couple and the parents of both parties were the main characters. Chu Qiuqiu was dressed beautifully as she smiled shyly on the stage. Meanwhile, Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s eyes were bleak and lonely.Chu Shi stayed with Chu Yin until the engagement process was completed. When the dining cart was rolled up, he left to get some food for Chu Yin.Under the eyes of everyone, the marriage between the Chen and Chu families was officially set. However, when Chen Xuanyuan stepped down, his bleak eyes suddenly focused on Chu Yin in the corner.\u201c???\u201d Chu Yin suddenly had an ominous premonition.At this time, another fiery sight fell on her.Zheng Yu also looked at her deeply, as if he had something to say.Chu Yin: Two indecent men made this garbage plot even worse.\u201cShow me the script\u2026\u201d Chu Yin fragilely knocked on the system.\u3010Location: Banquet Hall. Characters: Chu Yin, Chu Qiuqiu, Chen Xuanyuan, Zheng Yu.\u3011\u3010Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s heart was aching \u2013 Why is she looking at me with those painful eyes? She must be thinking: \u201cWhy is the person standing beside Xuanyuan my sister and not me?\u201d \u3011Chu Yin almost collapsed after reading this sentence.She forced herself not to vomit and read two more lines.\u3010Chen Xuanyuan knew this was wrong. He just got engaged to her sister, but if he didn\u2019t say something now, he may not have a chance in this life! He made up his mind and strode towards Chu Yin.\u3011\u3010Chen Xuanyuan stared at her as he arrogantly and wildly spoke his undying confession from the bottom of his heart.\u3011As a result of Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s improper behavior, a rumor spread around the wealthy circle that the Chu sisters were at odds with each other and the two girls were fighting over the sameman.\u201c\u2026.\u201d Chu Yin was about to faint.What\u2019s more, there\u2019s another critical hit.\u3010Zheng Yu also decided to take this opportunity to make up for his mistake. He went to Chu Yin and confided his feelings affectionately.\u3011This group of dogs!!!! Ah, ah, ah, dogs, proper etiquette please!!!!Chu Yin\u2019s account had a single sentence permission and a single paragraph permission. Now that it\u2019s hard to earn the authority, she was reluctant to use it on these two stupid men.Xueji: \u201cYou also have these prop cards \u2013 both a [delete card] and a [phrase card] in the host\u2019s account.\u201dIn the distance, the two men began to move towards her.Chu Yin: \u201cQuick, delete card\u2013\u201cShe didn\u2019t have time to think about it and directly deleted the words Chen Xuanyuan would say to her. The system then notified her that she had reached the word count of deletion.Chu Yin: \u201cThere\u2019s a limit to the deletion?!\u201dXueji: \u201cIt\u2019s 140 words.\u201dChu Yin: How can Chen Xuanyuan talk so much???\u201cAfter the deletion card is used, the remaining plot descriptions are automatically connected. To continue the plot, it will have a certain degree of randomness.\u201dChu Yin squinted at the random script.After the middle content was deleted, the first paragraph and the end paragraph got connected.It became\u2026Chen Xuanyuan and Zheng Yu facing each other as they shared their heartfelt feelings.\u201c\u2026..\u201dI\u2019m sorry.*Slipping away*\u2026In the middle of the banquet hall, the two men couldn\u2019t find the figure they were looking for. But in the end, they finally saw each other.Unsure of what triggered him, Chen Xuanyuan hoarsely said the words of his heart.Zheng Yu also confided his feelings deeply as if bewitched.When the lines were finished, the two of them were speechless.After Zheng Yu recovered: This man is really bold and indecent!Chen Xuanyuan reacted: This man is really disgusting!The two people looked at each other for a moment.\u201cOohh\u2013\u201cEveryone present all spat out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even if something did happen, they did not dare to admit it. They just wanted to cover up this kind of thing as soon as possible.\u201cDo you have to shame my dignity to be satisfied?\u201d\u201cThe other day you were talking about a woman! This time, it\u2019s a man?\u201dChen Xuanyuan: \u201cI\u2019m not! I didn\u2019t!\u201dFather Chen: \u201cShut up! You son of a bitch.\u201dChen Xuanyuan was scolded by his father.In view of his abnormal actions, Father Chen specially invited a psychiatrist and bodyguard to watch him. Once he became strange again, he would be immediately stunned and sent home.Moreover, in order to ensure the marriage between the two families, Father Chen ordered him to only meet Chu Qiuqiu. If it was another woman or man, it should be in private! No one should see!!After learning this, Chu Yin clapped wildly at her desk for a minute.Thank you, Father Chen!In this life, she finally didn\u2019t have to suffer because of stupid people! Father Chen deserves a huge thumbs up!Although there were some rumors among the rich and powerful families, few people in the school knew about it. Most people only knew that Chu Qiuqiu was engaged.Chu Qiuqiu was most concerned about her identity, and the arrival of Chu Yin had always been the source of her uneasiness.After getting engaged, no one would guess that she was only the adopted daughter of the Chu family. Even if someone mentioned it again, they would think that Chu Yin, who was not valued by the Chu family, was the fake daughter.Chu Qiuqiu felt that this marriage was a great event to change her life!\u201cQiuqiu, I envy you so much. You are Mrs. Chen now?\u201d Some students who did not receive the invitation came to Chu Qiuqiu to congratulate her.\u201cI heard that Chen Xuanyuan is very handsome? Do you have any pictures?\u201dChu Qiuqiu shyly talked about his fiance with her friends.\u201cHe\u2019s very handsome and also has a good character.\u201dLiang Yueqi took a boring look at those people and laughed mockingly.\u00a0A bunch of petty people.Tan Ke looked at the girls in the class and felt the headache. Chen Xuanyuan? He had seen him.Although he\u2019s not ugly, he\u2019s a playboy!The girls in the class then said: \u201cQiuqiu, don\u2019t you plan to arrange a fiance for your sister?\u201dDuring this break between classes, the classroom was empty. This sentence was not loud, but it was clear enough to be heard by everyone present.Lu Zhen suddenly raised his head.Silently, like a predator in the dark.Chu Qiuqiu covered her mouth with a smile: \u201cMy elder sister\u2026 All of her aspects\u2026are not suitable for marriage.\u201dThis was very ambiguous. If you think deeply about it, there were a lot of meanings.But now, Chu Yin\u2019s reputation in the school was completely different from when she first came.A male classmate next to her didn\u2019t get the meaning at all. He said frankly, \u201cIt\u2019s true! It\u2019s just a matter of time for us to marry\u00a01!\u201dWhen Tan Ke heard this sentence, he laughed. \u201cHan Chao, you\u2019re thinking of nonsense!\u201dHan Chao grinned: \u201cWhy, can I even greet her!\u201dLu Zhen frowned and coldly glanced at him.Han Chao suddenly shivered.Did Brother Zhen glare at me just now?Chu Qiuqiu listened to the remarks of the boys and felt uncomfortable.The girls around also asked with interest, \u201cDo you know if Chu Yin will perform in the Art Festival? I\u2019m looking forward to her performance.\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s eyebrows raised again and said with a smile, \u201cThis\u2026 I haven\u2019t heard of anything about it. I think my sister doesn\u2019t have any talent related to this.\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to perform.Because if she were to go on stage, she had to be responsible for the program. She had to set the content, think about the form, and rehearse several times. It would take a lot of time to plan it. She didn\u2019t have time to do this.There were two rehearsals for each class for the festival. The planning group of each class was composed of the class monitor and the art committee members. The monitor of Class 5 was Li Jin, and the art committee member was Jiang Yan.Chu Yin could see that both of them wanted her in the show.The group of boys represented by Li Jin felt that Chu Yin was the face of Class 5.She didn\u2019t need to be a major performer. As long as she was in the show, she would definitely attract a lot of people\u2019s attention.The art festival was also a competition. Each class performance had a rating based on the audience\u2019s vote. The winning class would get a bonus, which could be a kind of collective honor.Jiang Yan was also looking forward to Chu Yin\u2019s performance.But she also knew how much Chu Yin valued learning. So although she was very eager, she was embarrassed to ask Chu Yin.Chu Yin noticed Jiang Yan\u2019s staring, and silently raised the book in her hand to block her face.No, my conscience hurts.She had to do something to calm down.Chu Yin and Han Chuying chatted last night about sending the dusty exercise book to Chu Yin, so Chu Yin needed to go and get it.As soon as she left, Fu Mingxuan said with a smile to Jiang Yan, \u201cSee? Even though you treat her as a friend, she won\u2019t participate in the activity you organize.\u201dXing Lan said: \u201cShe\u2019s really cold-hearted.\u201dMonitor Li Jin said: \u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to say that\u2026\u201dXing Lan: \u201cIsn\u2019t that true? We all signed up for the show.\u201dFu Mingxuan snorted and laughed. She prepared a very fairy-like dance with her friends. Everyone would be wearing a white feather skirt at that time. It would be absolutely amazing!She hooked her hair: \u201cIsn\u2019t it? When no one paid attention to her before, wasn\u2019t Jiang Yan the first one to take the initiative to talk with her? But Chu Yin doesn\u2019t seem to know how to repay her kindness.\u201dLi Jin looked embarrassed at their remarks.Jiang Yan, who usually spoke softly, suddenly looked at Fu Mingxuan and said, \u201cWhat kind of relationship is this?\u201dFu Mingxuan didn\u2019t respond: \u201cWhat?\u201dJiang Yan frowned at her: \u201cDo you have to receive benefits when talking with people? Why do you ask others to repay you for such a thing?\u201dThe class was quiet when her words came out.If you think about it, she was right!According to this logic, when Fu Mingxuan and her friends took the lead in isolating Chu Yin, Chu Yin didn\u2019t bother with them at all.Fu Mingxuan\u2019s face was ugly, and even her friends were embarrassed.\u201cBesides, it\u2019s entirely voluntary whether you want to perform or not,\u201d Jiang Yan returned to her seat. \u201cIf you want to dance, it doesn\u2019t mean that other people have to perform.\u201dAs soon as Song Zhaolin returned to his class, he heard this sentence. With his years of experience in the melon field, he knew she was probably speaking for Chu Yin.His gossiping mouth opened immediately, \u201cYes!\u201dLi Jin immediately laughed: \u201cLin Zi, did you hear us?\u201dSong Zhaolin said: \u201cNo! But Xiao Yan is right!\u201dThe whole class was amused by him.Chapter 39 \u2013 Losing her skin (2)Chu Yin didn\u2019t know what happened in the class. She went to the classroom of Class 1, stood at the back door, and looked inside.The boy sitting at the back door turned his head inadvertently and suddenly saw Chu Yin. He was so surprised that he almost fell out of his chair.All of a sudden, the whole class\u2019s eyes turned and everyone saw the figure at the back door.Han Chuying\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up and waved wildly: \u201cYin, come in!\u201dSeveral friends beside her were all a little nervous.Ah, is Chu Yin coming inside?Oh, my God! Oh, my God! This is the first time they were so close to their wife!Chu Yin hesitated and went in.She went to Han Chuying\u2019s desk, stopped, and slightly bowed her head: \u201cHello?\u201dAs soon as Han Chuying saw her friends\u2019 reactions, she felt superior. \u201cI\u2019ll introduce them to you. They are all my friends and they all like you.\u201dSeveral boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 faces turned red instantly.Why are you so straightforward!!\u201cThis is Zhao Qingyao. She is the chief planner of the festival.\u201dChu Yin said hello to them with a smile, and then raised her eyebrows: \u201cYou are so talented.\u201dZhao Qingyao: !!!Holding a book, Zhao Qingyao blushingly looked at Chu Yin\u2019s face and asked expectantly, \u201cClassmate Chu Yin, will you participate in the art festival?\u201dWhen she asked, several faces looked at her.They were like sunflowers. Turning their heads towards the sun.Chu Yin didn\u2019t expect to face a dozen expectant faces, so she felt more uneasy.She raised her hand to touch her nose: \u201cMaybe not\u2026\u201dZhao Qingyao was disappointed. Class 5 announced that there was a female dance group will perform.She was still dreaming with Han Chuying just now. If Chu Yin came out and danced with Class 5, they would surely faint!Alas, they thought too much. After all, they didn\u2019t know whether Chu Yin could dance.Han Chuying took out the exercise book, handed it to Chu Yin, and said sincerely, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t perform. As long as you participate..\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhy?\u201dHan Chuying: \u201cBecause even your still-figure is a work of art! I can watch it all the time!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dI can\u2019t stand it.Overbearing Chuying and her aggressive fangirling.\u2026\u2026After returning to class, Song Zhaolin had understood the whole story of what happened, and once he saw Chu Yin, he reported to her.When Chu Yin heard what Jiang Yan said in front of others, she was suddenly moved.As soon as she was moved, her already precarious conscience became even more uneasy.\u201cElder sister, elder sister Yin,\u201d Song Zhaolin scratched his head and came over, \u201cAre you really not going to participate? There are ten roles in our class\u2019s play. You can claim the one with the most leisure time.\u201dChu Yin finally wavered: \u201cIs there a role with fewer lines?\u201dAs soon as she wavered, Song Zhaolin said, \u201cHurry up, little Yanyan, choose a role for Sister Yin!\u201dJiang Yan blinked her eyes, surprised: \u201cReally?\u201dAs soon as Chu Yin saw her happy appearance, she didn\u2019t refuse and only replied with a smile, \u201cReally.\u201dSong Zhaolin pointed to the script and suggested, \u201cI think this Ms. Wang is very suitable for you. She\u2019s my girlfriend in the play.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cGo away.\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s role was the protagonist. He had a lot of lines, and the play was very eye-catching.Chu Yin only wanted to choose a background role with fewer words, less drama, and less attention.\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Jiang Yan hesitated and said, \u201cThere\u2019s a role that fits well, but it\u2019s a male role!\u201dAnd it\u2019s the scum man in the script. How can Yin Yin play such a role!But Chu Yin\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened: \u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201dShe didn\u2019t want to release her charm on stage. It\u2019s just right for her to dress up as a man!Even if Lu Zhen, that dog man, saw her, he wouldn\u2019t be interested!Perfect \u221aFinally, at the strong request of Chu Yin, it was decided that she would play the role of \u201cscum man\u201d.Song Zhaolin gave her a wink: \u201cSince you\u2019ll also be wearing men\u2019s clothes, we will be competing on the same stage. Sister Yin, don\u2019t lose to me.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cHaha\u201dThe characters in the play of Class 5 were soon finalized. It was organized by Jiang Yan and rehearsed in different stages.Chu Yin received her paper script. It turned out that the \u201cscum man\u201d role she chose for herself was the right choice. She only had a few lines!In this urban emotional drama, Chu Yin as the scum man was responsible for destroying many girls\u2019 hearts.Chu Yin felt that after experiencing the double hot eyes of Zheng Yu and Chen Xuanyuan, she would be able to grasp this character\u2019s essence.So when it came to her acting, she was very confident.Her target as a \u2018scum\u2019 man was the little girl in her class.Chu Yin stepped forward, bowed her head, and got closer.Learning from Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s evil charm, she copied his smile by curling her lips and said, \u201cWhy do you want to resist your own heart? Won\u2019t you be honest with yourself?\u201dSince the rehearsal room was empty, she lowered her voice. But this made her voice sound a little hoarse.Then, the girl who should have pushed her away and yell, \u201cYou shameless\u201d, suddenly had her face turn red.Not only her, but a large group of people who were watching covered their mouths.Ah, help! How handsome!!!Wouldn\u2019t it be great if she became a male model?!Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dI\u2019m a scum! Scum man!Chu Yin was slightly frustrated.She didn\u2019t expect that she couldn\u2019t even play such a supporting role!For a competitive person, this was absolutely not allowed to happen. So Chu Yin, who agreed to give only a little energy to the program, could not help but begin to figure out her own character setting.Walking in the corridor, she was suddenly slapped on the back: \u201cSister Yin ~ ~\u201dShe was caught off guard. She turned around and almost scolded him with swear words, \u201cYou stupid\u2013\u201dBefore her cussing words came out, she suddenly saw Lu Zhen standing beside Song Zhaolin.Chu Yin: No, I\u2019m just a normal good student.She immediately swallowed the words back and put on a new face: \u201cMelon\u00a01.\u201dChapter 39 \u2013 Losing her skin (3)Song Zhaolin: \u201cYes.\u201dBefore Song Zhaolin could say anything, he was suddenly pulled back by Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen frowned slightly, and his voice was a bit cold: \u201cIt\u2019s not light.\u00a01\u201cSong Zhaolin realized the power of his palm just now, and quickly said: \u201cI slapped hard? Sorry! Sister Yin, you can swear at me!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c??\u2026\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s dark vision glanced over, a light glint reflecting in his eyes.Is the dog man watching me?Chu Yin was innocent: \u201cI don\u2019t swear.\u201dSong Zhaolin: Ah???Chu Yin didn\u2019t know that her pig deskmate told Lu Zhen about the meaning of her WeChat name\u00a02.She looked friendly: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. If you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll go first.\u201dSister Yin was so abnormal that Song Zhaolin worried that she was really angry, and quickly held her back: \u201cAre you really not angry? I don\u2019t believe it! You can scold me.\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t want her character setting to collapse in front of the dog man, so she began to escape: \u201cI\u2019m not angry. No need to think about it!\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cImpossible! If you don\u2019t scold me, it means you are angry!\u201dAh, ah, ah.Chu Yin wanted to faint. She blocked her ears and said, \u201cThe dog barks, the dog barks!\u201dThen she ran away.Song Zhaolin\u2019s face was dull: \u201cIs this a curse?\u201dLu Zhen stood beside him with a smile on his face. The red-tear mole under his eye was particularly obvious.Lu Zhen was almost sure that Chu Yin was pretending to be good.Pretending to be good. So cute.His heart was burning. Suddenly, there was an unspeakable desire to take off her disguise.The little nerd in his eyes is wild.Lu Zhen smiled for a while.After smiling, he turned his head and looked at Song Zhaolin.He looked down as he said in a light tone: \u201cYou\u2019re really quite cheap.\u201dSong Zhaolin: ???Why attack me!The past few days, all of the classes were preparing for the art festival.When Han Chuying and Zhao Qingyao learned that Chu Yin would participate in the drama of Class 5, they happily beat their gongs and drums. They wanted to come and watch her every day.Chu Yin was under more pressure.Even if her role was just the supporting scum man, she also wanted to perform this slag man\u2019s character in pure form! [clench]During the rehearsal, Zhao Qingyao was organizing the layout of the venue, so she didn\u2019t come to see her.After rehearsing her part, Chu Yin communicated with the props group about her scum man image. Then, she left the rehearsal classroom, intending to go back to answer some questions.Returning to the classroom, she suddenly met Zhao Qingyao who seemed to be in a hurry.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dZhao Qingyao was a little disoriented and said, \u201cHan Chuying borrowed old tables and chairs from the neighboring school. I don\u2019t know what happened but it resulted in a conflict. Just now, someone came back and told me that the students in the neighboring school wanted to start a fight!\u201dChu Yin frowned and stopped her: \u201cDon\u2019t go there by yourself. It\u2019s better to find someone. Boys are the best.\u201dZhao Qingyao was so flustered.Listening to Chu Yin\u2019s voice, she immediately nodded: \u201cI understand!\u201dChu Yin watched her run to find someone before going to the neighboring school.Han Chuying was very smart. She was not someone that would cause trouble. This time, it was obvious that those neighboring school students deliberately found fault.Chu Yin entered the neighboring school. She didn\u2019t spend a lot of time finding those gangsters.They were all acquaintances.A group of people who like to play with poop.These gangsters were committed to doing evil things every day. Han Chuying probably didn\u2019t do anything to them. They picked a fight just because she was from Huiwen.The two girls from Huiwen were surrounded while holding the tables. They looked very helpless.Chu Yin took a few steps forward and moved her shoulder and neck.She made them play with poop every time without directly hitting them. Because she only did this, it resulted in this kind of problem. Now that they met today, she needed to solve the problem once and for all.As soon as Chu Yin came into their field of vision, their attention immediately shifted.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t this the top student next door!\u201dWhen Han Chuying saw Chu Yin, she quickly ran to her.Why did she come by herself?? Doesn\u2019t she know it\u2019s frightening to provoke them!Han Chuying looked at Chu Yin\u2019s thin body, and her heart filled with more intense worry.Ah, what if this beautiful woman gets beaten? No, no!Chu Yin looked at the little gangsters, raised her chin slightly, and then took the lead in walking behind the school building.\u201cElder sister, is this girl challenging us again?\u201dHan Chuying subconsciously wanted to catch up. But since she was much more rational, she ran back to Huiwen.It\u2019s no use for her to rush there. She has to find a male student to help them!\u2026\u2026Chu Yin confronted the trio of sisters behind the school building.They smiled with their fists, \u201cYou started it this time. We apologize in advance for our impoliteness\u2026\u201dChu Yin nodded and suddenly raised her hand.\u201cI know you like to play with poop, but today, I can\u2019t let you play with them anymore!\u201dBecause \u2013 word change permissions are too precious! And you don\u2019t deserve it!When they realized that she was insulting them, they immediately jumped in to fight her.\u2026\u2026On the other hand, Zhao Qingyao was looking for help in school. Many people were angry when they heard that their classmates had been cheated by the students in the neighboring school. They were ready to go to the rescue.Then, Han Chuying also ran back. She happened to meet Lu Zhen and Song Zhaolin.The two of them looked very good at fighting. Han Chuying took a deep breath and immediately said, \u201cGo to the neighboring school. They\u2019re behind the school building.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cAh?\u201dLu Zhen was indifferent.Han Chuying gasped for air: \u201cChu Yin was called away by the students of that school. I\u2019m afraid she will be beaten!\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cAh?\u201dBefore he could even finish speaking, the person beside him suddenly moved.Song Zhaolin had known Lu Zhen for so long, but just discovered that he could run so fast.In the blink of an eye, Lu Zhen rushed out of Huiwen\u2019s school gate, so fast that his hair swayed behind his head.Song Zhaolin panicked for a second. He immediately shook his arms and exclaimed: \u201cHurry up! Our school\u2019s flower will be bullied! If you\u2019re a man, follow me!\u201d\u2026\u2026Finally, a large group of people marched into the campus of the neighboring school.\u201cWhere are they, Lin?\u201dSong Zhaolin was also a little confused. When he saw Lu Zhen\u2019s back in the distance, he immediately yelled, \u201cHurry up! Follow Brother Zhen!\u201dA group of people stormed into the back of the school building.Song Zhaolin shouted as he rushed forward, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid! We\u2019re coming!\u201dHe rushed towards Lu Zhen\u2019s back before poking out his head. In the distance, he saw that the girl in Huiwen\u2019s school uniform kicked the gangster girl from the neighboring school.That leg kick was very high.From a positive point of view, the legs were extremely slender. The posture of the body was excellent. There was also a kind of aggressive tension.And there were three people at her feet.Song Zhaolin: Damn.Everyone: *Speechless*Chu Yin retracted her leg.She just asked Zhao Qingyao to pull a few people at random. Why was it taking so long?Chu Yin turned around and suddenly saw a large group of stupefied people.In the middle of the crowd, Lu Zhen stood there, looking at her without blinking.That pair of black eyes seemed to glint with something.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dNo\u2026I can explain!Song Zhaolin stupidly said to Lu Zhen: \u201cBrother Zhen.\u201d\u201cI think your status as the school\u2019s Apollo is not secure.\u201dThis person can be handsome too?!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

(1)For a moment, this scene could leave anyone speechless.Chu Yin: Can it rain now?Xueji: \u201cWhat rain?\u201dChu Yin: Amnesia rain.After being drenched, everyone would lose their memory.Once they lose their memory, she would return to her good student image! She doesn\u2019t know any swear words! She\u2019s a good student!Xueji: Obviously notChu Yin: It\u2019s too hard for me.However, a large group of students from Huiwen, who came to the rescue, suddenly began to applaud and cheer after being stupefied for ten seconds.\u201cMy sister is so handsome!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to bend, I\u2019m going to bend \u2013 No, I\u2019m a man!\u201d\u201cIs this a fairy? Sister wins glory for the school in all directions!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dNo.I really don\u2019t want to.The most arrogant gangster who was on the ground tried hard to get up and fight back.At this time, Chu Yin was rubbing the fire in her heart. When she saw her trying to get up, she bent down and squeezed her collar tightly. The gangster\u2019s face suddenly turned red.Chu Yin threatened in her ear: \u201cBe honest, do you want to be beaten again?\u201dThe gangster made a quick decision and immediately pretended to be dead.\u2014\u2014Who wants to be beaten! I can\u2019t fuckin\u2019 beat you!!This woman had obviously trained in martial arts! She turned out to be a tiger?!Chu Yin grabbed her collar, shook it, and ordered, \u201cStand up quickly and pretend to be fine.\u201dEldest sister: ???What, stand up and get beaten again?So she pretended to be dead.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe stood up and gave the two gangsters a condescending glance.A few of them pretended to be dead.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe had no choice but to zip up her school uniform and sort out her messy hair. She coughed: \u201cThis is a misunderstanding.\u201dSong Zhaolin waved his arm: \u201cThere is no misunderstanding! Sister Yin, you are the most handsome! You are the light and glory of Huiwen!\u201dThe girls nodded wildly: \u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d\u201cBeautiful sister, don\u2019t hit them, hit me!\u201dThe three people lying on the ground: ??? Fuck you. Is there something wrong with Huiwen?Chu Yin raised her hand to cover her face.She didn\u2019t dare to look at Lu Zhen\u2019s expression now.However, she was lucky to think that although Lu Zhen, that dog man, liked wild girls, he should not like this kind of wild.In a word, I advise you not to have the wrong idea, or I will kill you!!At this time, the security of the neighboring school finally came. He saw that the three people lying on the ground were those who often made trouble in school.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d The security personnel muttered.Song Zhaolin immediately reported: \u201cThe students in your school maliciously bullied us. These three people attacked this girl!\u201dHuiwen\u2019s students echoed: \u201cYes, yes!\u201dSecurity personnel: \u201cBut she\u2026she does not have any injuries!\u201dIsn\u2019t it the other way around?Security personnel: \u201cIf this is indeed true, these students will pay for it!\u201dAt this time, Lu Zhen, who kept his silence all this time, suddenly made a sound: \u201cCarry them to the hospital. If they need treatment, treat it.\u201dSecurity personnel: \u201c\u2026\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows were raised: \u201cI will contact this school\u2019s board of directors.\u201dIn front of the security personnel, Lu Zhen looked like a young student. But when he heard his words, he dared not ignore him. After hesitating for a few seconds, the security personnel went forward and carried away the students lying on the ground.At the end of the scene, Chu Yin secretly escaped from the crowd.Having just walked a few steps, she was suddenly held back by the wrist.When she lifted her eyes, she was met by Lu Zhen\u2019s deep smiling eyes. His voice was clear and cheerful, \u201cHero, what are you running away for?\u201d\u2014\uff1fDog man, do you mean me?!!Chu Yin\u2019s expression turned tense.Lu Zhen immediately released her when her expression turned tense.Chu Yin slightly raised her eyes and explained, \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not a hero. I\u2019m just an ordinary student.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyes lowered as his lips raised, \u201cI didn\u2019t say you\u2019re not.\u201dWhen he hurriedly ran over just now, his heart was beating wildly. He was worried that she could not fight them alone.When he found them behind the school building, the fight wasn\u2019t over yet. Lu Zhen saw how the fight went.He saw with his own eyes how Chu Yin\u2019s elbow accurately hit the student when they tried to sneak from behind.It\u2019s not bad.The good and clever student character setting collapsed at that moment. Lu Zhen felt that there was never a persona that could be more appropriate for her than the her at this time\u00a01.Chu Yin\u2019s dark eyes stared for a moment, trying to understand Lu Zhen\u2019s mind.What are you smiling for!!Lu Zhen looked at her and asked, \u201cSo, who taught you how to fight?\u201dChapter 40 \u2013 I\u2019m the scum sister! (2)Chu Yin was startled, realizing that he had asked this question before. It was the time when Fu Mingxuan forcibly pulled off her mask near the pool. After that incident, Lu Zhen asked her this same question.At that time, she still had her good student persona. She didn\u2019t expect that half a year later, her good persona would fall apart!She hates it!!But at this time, there was no need to rebuild her image. The plot had derailed so much already that Chu Yin even had the impulse to break away from the plot completely.She lightly said, \u201cI trained to beat an asshole someday.\u201dLu Zhen was slightly startled before he regained himself. He laughed as he said, \u201cThen he is quite miserable.\u201dChu Yin snorted in her heart \u2013 that asshole\u2019s life had been miserable lately\u2026experiencing a driving speed of 180 mph.\u201cBut he probably deserves it.\u201d Lu Zhen added.Chu Yin:?Thank you for mocking yourself!The dog man himself said that he deserved it. It felt good hearing it from him.When her classmates came, she was already cleaning the battlefield, so she didn\u2019t leave any room for them to take pictures and videos. But because of this, Chu Yin\u2019s image and reputation had eight versions which were quickly spread in the forum and various social media groups.Song Zhaolin broadcasted to Chu Yin in real-time, \u201cSister Yin, you gained more female fans today.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThey started a fight over you.\u201d Song Zhaolin said while reading the chat history. \u201cIn the end, Han Chuyin won because she slept with you for ten days, which was envied by others.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cI think you have less homework today.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cAlso, you have more male fans! Older and younger ones. In this category, I won against them because the bond we share as tablemates couldn\u2019t be defeated.\u201dChu Yin smiled, \u201cFather-son love is thicker.\u201dThese Huiwen high school students are too idle.Is being a high school student not giving you any sense of urgency! Seniors are about to take the college entrance examination soon!It\u2019s more important to learn at this time!Because of Chu Yin\u2019s recent handsome activity, the expectation of the whole grade towards Class 5\u2019s drama was higher than ever. Everyone was excited after hearing that Chu Yin would be participating.In addition to learning, Chu Yin studied her lines as well as figuring out her scumbag character.Song Zhaolin was under the most pressure. He\u2019s the male lead of the play! He must not lose to the role of Sister Yin!But on second thought, he felt he had the advantage. After all, he didn\u2019t need to study, while Chu Yin would take some time off to study. Moreover, Sister Yin would be wearing a wig and a man\u2019s outfit, which wouldn\u2019t compare to his natural handsome look.As a result, Song Zhaolin completely abandoned his studies, choosing to practice his script lines instead.In the evening at Song\u2019s residence, Song Yanchuan just finished a call with someone. He frowned when he heard Song Zhaolin reciting his lines from the balcony. To understand him, he asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dSong Zhaolin was craving an audience, so he improvised and showed his majestic acting skills.Song Yanchuan listened carefully to the content of his lines of, \u201cI will always guard you.\u201d and \u201cThe world is full of evil, butyou are as clear as the rain and dew.\u201dHe felt disgusted and nauseous. He almost wanted to hit this stupid brother.\u201cWhat the hell are you doing?\u201dSong Zhaolin shook his hair, revealing his dreamy smile, \u201cI\u2019m acting as a handsome male lead.\u201dSong Yanchuan: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe looked at his brother\u2019s face and evaluated his temperament.Song Yanchuan commented, \u201cThen you have to work hard.\u201dSong Zhaolin: ?? Are you insulting me?In a blink of an eye, it\u2019s the rehearsal day of the art festival.Many people had changed into their performance costumes. For their dance show, Fu Mingxuan and her female classmates wore white feather skirts and delicate make-up. They looked beautiful and eye-catching.Fu Mingxuan glanced at the students who were acting in the drama. They were all dressed in ordinary clothes. Chu Yin didn\u2019t even change her school uniform.They weren\u2019t shining at all. Fu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t help but proudly think that she had to carry the performance rating for their class.Chu Yin sat in the corner with a piece of paper spread out in front of her. The order of the rehearsal was posted on the screen. The people who finished practicing could then leave. Chu Yin was quite envious of them because their practice would almost be finished.Fu Mingxuan and others quickly came to the stage and started dancing to the accompaniment. None of them had studied dancing professionally. Although their postures were mediocre, their expression and costumes outshined everything.Zhao Qingyao and two teachers watched the rehearsal. After the performance, they would give out their comments and advice.Fu Mingxuan took over the stage and confidently walked off with a smile. The next performance happened to be Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s. As soon as the plastic sisters met off the stage, they started biting each other again.\u201cXuanxuan, your dancing performance was so wonderful~\u201d Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s eyes were shining as if she was envious, \u201cI feel like my zither skills aren\u2019t good compared to yours.\u201dShe was implicating that she was a professional zither player while Fu Mingxuan and the others were amateurs.\u201c\u2026..\u201d Fu Mingxuan rolled her eyes and smirked, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, Qiuqiu. Your level 6 zither skill is good! Although Liang Yueqi is level 9, I don\u2019t believe that you can\u2019t beat her!\u201dFu Mingxuan didn\u2019t want to praise Liang Yueqi at all, but as long as she could insult Chu Qiuqiu, then it was fine.Chu Qiuqiu: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe competed against Liang Yueqi before. Liang Yueqi\u2019s zither skill was much better than her. She didn\u2019t know where Fu Mingxuan got this information from.After exchanging insults with Fu Mingxuan, Chu Qiuqiu stepped onto the stage with Liang Yueqi and sat down behind the guzheng.Although Liang Yueqi\u2019s guzheng skill was better than her, she still had the talent to stand on the same stage as her.Chu Qiuqiu inquired about her sister\u2019s participation in this event and found that her sister only took a supporting role in her class\u2019s drama.This made Chu Qiuqiu feel superior. Chu Yin was, after all, a country bumpkin.After the performance, the audience applauded. Chu Qiuqiu glanced at Chu Yin in the corner area with Class 5 and smiled gracefully.Liang Yueqi sneered in her heart. Before, she was upset that Chu Yin defeated her. But now, Chu Qiuqiu? Pretending to be a pro player with this kind of skill?Chu Yin, who was sitting in the audience, was completely unaware of the undercurrent storm surging between these women. She finished a whole set of questions before looking up to find that the auditorium was almost empty.\u201cOh, what a pity!\u201d Song Zhaolin sighed beside her.Chu Yin: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThe piano couldn\u2019t be delivered today. Brother Zhen originally was going to play the piano!\u201dThe girls from Class 5 looked regretful.Chu Yin was slightly distracted, suddenly remembering the past events of her previous life.\u2026\u2026Lu Zhen did perform the piano while she chose the music.At that time, she didn\u2019t know anything about piano music. Lu Zhen insisted that she choose a song. Later that day, she went home and secretly searched for the most difficult piece of Beethoven\u2019s \u2013 Piano Sonata Opus 106.She originally thought that he would give up, but on the day of the performance, Lu Zhen still played the song.All the girls in the school went crazy.Lu Zhen hugged her on that day and told her he had been practicing this piano piece for a long time. Chu Yin didn\u2019t tell him he was handsome while playing the piano, and instead kicked him and told him to go away.Looking back, it felt like a lifetime ago.\u2026\u2026\u201cSister Yin, it\u2019s our turn now!\u201d Song Zhaolin poked her.Chu Yin recovered from her thoughts and stepped onto the stage with Class 5. The auditorium was almost empty. Zhang Qingyao watched them on the stage and gave expectant and encouraging expressions.Chu Yin only appeared a few times on the stage. She spent most of her time waiting on the side, watching Song Zhaolin show off his charms.LinLin surprisingly performed well. Because of his comedic aura, the teachers were amused by him.Chu Yin finished her part conscientiously. It was gratifying that the female classmate who acted with her did not blush this time.When they got off the stage, the rehearsal was over. Chu Yin picked up her bag and planned to go home to study, but was suddenly stopped by Han Chuying.\u201cThanks, I\u2019ve decided!\u201d Her eyes brightened in the dim light of the auditorium.\u201cDecided what?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of your makeup during the art festival!\u201d Han Chuying clenched her fist, \u201cI must make you the most handsome scumbag!\u201dChu Yin: You don\u2019t have to though?Han Chuying would make sure that her Sister Yin is the most beautiful in her performance! For sure!The weather had completely warmed up in April. Huiwen\u2019s art festival finally began.The front row of the auditorium was reserved for the school leaders, while the back of the auditorium was for the students. The audience was very excited.Chu Yin was pulled to a separate room by Han Chuying to do her makeup.Han Chuying carefully took out a wig from her bag: \u201cI spent a lot of money to buy this. I was reluctant to take it out, but you deserve to wear it.\u201dThe wig in her hand cost a thousand dollars. Han Chuying felt that only Chu Yin\u2019s face was worthy of it!Chu Yin: \u201cSo expensive. Don\u2019t make me wear\u2026\u201dHan Chuying firmly cut her off: \u201cYou should wear it!\u201dThen she started her tiger operation.Twenty minutes later, Han Chuying finished fixing her wig completely. She stepped back, looked at Chu Yin\u2019s face, and was so mesmerized that she could hardly breathe.Sister! Sister! Too Handsome! Ah!The color of the hair was black with a trace of dark blue. It complemented the fair skin of Chu Yin. Her forehead was covered with thin bangs. Since the wig\u2019s hair went down to her neck, it made her look like a delicate teenager.Chu Yin looked in the mirror and found her appearance interesting.Han Chuying applied soft makeup on Chu Yin. Highlights and makeup shadows made her originally gentle features more youthful and three-dimensional.Chu Yin changed into a classic white shirt, a loose black tie, and a two-button collar.Chu Yin raised her hand to rub the tip of her nose.It\u2019s her first time dressing as a man. She wasn\u2019t used to it at first and had to look in the mirror for a while.Han Chuying was excited, \u201cYou must show up later, okay? It will cause a commotion!\u201dWhat kind of School Apollo do you want? Isn\u2019t she enough!!!Chu Yin smiled helplessly, \u201cI know.\u201dAfter helping Chu Yin, Han Chuyin helped Zhao Qingyao with her makeup. Chu Yin stayed alone for a while before slipping backstage to watch the performances.As soon as she entered the corridor, she heard the sound of a piano.\u201cBrother Zhen is so handsome, Wuwu\u2026\u201d\u201cMy husband! I want to be that piano.\u201dChu Yin leaned against the wall and listened for a while.He didn\u2019t play Opus 106 in this life. Instead, he played a melodious tune. The sound of the piano was like a kind of deep confession.She glanced at the audience through the curtain and found that the reaction of the girls was the same as in her previous life.Lu Zhen, who was wearing a white shirt, sat in front of the piano. He had a silver brooch attached to his chest.He lowered his head as he played the piano, his slender fingers flying across the piano keys.Chu Yin applauded when his performance ended.Seeing that it\u2019s time for her class to perform soon, Chu Yin turned to find Song Zhaolin.Everyone came to see Lu Zhen playing the piano so no one was in the corridor.Once she came to the waiting area of Class 5, everyone suddenly fell silent as they looked at her blankly.Chu Yin\u2018s lips pursed as she raised her hand, \u201cHi?\u201dAll of the things that the girls were holding fell to the ground with a bang.Chapter 40 \u2013 I\u2019m the scum sister! (3)Song Zhaolin\u2019s eyes widened exaggeratedly \u2013 Who is this handsome man??Chu Yin felt embarrassed about being stared at. She rubbed the tip of her nose, \u201cIs it too eye-catching and extravagant?\u201dSong Zhaolin finally recovered, \u201cAhhh!!\u201dHe lost to his Sister Yin!What kind of person is she? Is it okay for a girl to be this handsome?!!The faces of the female students who had a role with Chu Yin were already blushing at this moment.\u2014 We can\u2019t help it! We don\u2019t want to push this handsome scumbag away at all. We just want to shout, \u201cWe like you!\u201dBecause of Chu Yin\u2019s stunning appearance, the entire performance group was extremely excited. Everyone\u2019s state instantly elevated. They wanted to go to the stage and perform immediately!Finally, the host announced that it was Class 5\u2019s turn to perform. The audience was hysterical.Fu Mingxuan, Chu Qiuqiu, and Liang Yueqi had finished performing. At the moment, they were sitting in different positions, waiting for Chu Yin to appear.If she didn\u2019t perform well, she would be ridiculed.The stage lights dimmed before they brightened again. The show started with Song Zhaolin\u2019s appearance.The plot was not complicated. Because Song Zhaolin\u2019s expression was so expressive, the audience burst into laughter from time to time.Tan Ke laughed among the audience, \u201cHow can Lin Zi act so badly? I will die of laughter!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips curled up with a smile.Song Zhaolin, the leading actor, met the leading actress in a form of misunderstanding. Their feelings warmed up amusingly. Just when their feelings were about to go deeper, the scumbag man appeared on stage.With background music, Chu Yin slowly stepped onto the stage.Under the spotlight, the short-haired beautiful boy lazily walked into the audience\u2019s field of vision.Her shirt was loose, her black tie swayed slightly, and her casual expression looked fascinating.The whole auditorium fell silent.Lu Zhen looked at her without blinking, subconsciously holding his breath.Chu Yin felt guilty for a second but forced herself to continue. She walked up to the leading actress with a smile. She tilted her head and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with that poor boy? How about you look at me instead?\u201dEven before the leading actress could answer, a scream came out of the auditorium, \u201cOkay!!!!\u2014\u201dBecause she was too excited, the voice echoed and reverberated in the whole venue.The people burst into laughter.But then, people shouted one after another, \u201cMe too!\u201d\u201cI am also willing!\u201dIt took a long time for the audience to settle down.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin firmly maintained her scumbag nature. She finished her part amidst the blushing face of the leading actress. After stepping off the stage, she supported herself on the wall and thought deeply.Did I make a mistake acting like a scumbag?At this moment, all of the WeChat groups exploded.[Ah, Chu Yin\u2019s appearance today!][Sister Yin, how about me? I am willing!!][I\u2019m announcing now that I\u2019m voting Chu Yin as the school\u2019s Apollo next year! Brother Zhen, I\u2019m sorry!!]Chu Qiuqiu and the others looked very complicated.They thought that Chu Yin\u2019s acting might be bad and her lines would be awkward. They also thought that she wouldn\u2019t perform well. They never thought that she would outshine their expectations!At the end of the curtain call, as all the actors bowed side by side, the whole auditorium screamed.Tan Ke exclaimed: \u201cThat was absolutely amazing.\u201dTurning to see Lu Zhen, he saw him leaning back in his chair and laughing.\u201cWhy are you laughing, Brother Zhen?\u201dLu Zhen smiled and said in a low voice: \u201cIt\u2019s okay to be a father.\u201dTan Ke was confused: \u201cAh?\u201dLu Zhen didn\u2019t explain any further and only watched Chu Yin with a smile.Really handsome.On that day, the total votes for the art festival performances were released. Class 5\u2019s drama placed first on the rankings.The number of votes was several hundred higher than Lu Zhen\u2019s piano solo.Class 5 got the first place prize and the enthusiasm didn\u2019t dissipate for several days. The picture of Chu Yin\u2019s performance was widely spread throughout the entire school.Song Zhaolin saw that someone used Chu Yin\u2019s photo for their mobile desktop.He felt more and more sure that Brother Zhen\u2019s status as the school\u2019s Apollo was not guaranteed. And that his Sister Yin would take both titles.Meanwhile, Chu Yin felt that she could finally focus on studying since the festival was over.But she did not expect that the aftermath of the art festival was bigger than she thought.First, pink love letters began to appear on her table.And then they began to upgrade into a variety of girlish little gifts.Seeing the handwriting from those gifts, she could guess that some of them were written by boys.Chu Yin went out to get water and saw several girls with blushing faces in the corridor.She could tolerate it since they were girls.But she soon saw someone she couldn\u2019t bear\u2014\u2014Chu Yin stood at the door of the women\u2019s toilet, calmly looking at the timid first-year high school student. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dThe freshman male student shyly looked at Chu Yin and said, \u201cI always thought I was bent.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin looked at him in silence, \u201cI think your guess is right.\u201dHe carefully brushed his hair and loudly said, \u201cBut since I saw you, I think I can love again!\u201dChu Yin: I can\u2019t!!The young freshman confessed super loudly, \u201cI\u2019m willing to do anything for you!\u201dChu Yin wanted to collapse, \u201cI can\u2019t be the man that rides a horse!!!\u201d\u2026\u2026The incident regarding Chu Yin and the gay freshman student quickly spread.After Song Zhaolin finished eating melon seeds in the VIP spot, he went and told Lu Zhen and friends.\u201cI think she wants to hit him, but she\u2019s trying her best to endure hahahaha\u2013\u201dTan Ke burst into laughter. Next to him, Lu Zhen\u2019s face was tranquil.After observing for a few days, his sense of crisis grew. Chu Yin is so popular.Both\u2026men and women.She was much gentler to girls than to boys. Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know whether this was a good thing or not.Chu Yin received all kinds of confession letters and gifts every day. Because many of them didn\u2019t put their names, she couldn\u2019t return them.Song Zhaolin sighed, \u201cI think there are people who still give gifts like rings. They\u2019re very coquettish. I don\u2019t know who Sister Yin will choose.\u201dLu Zhen slightly lowered his eyes and rubbed his knuckles.He can\u2019t wait.\u2026Chu Yin fled home as soon as school was over. She didn\u2019t dare to stay in school any longer, otherwise she would encounter strange suitors.She originally intended to be part of the background, but who knew it would become like this.After finishing today\u2019s task, Chu Yin planned to unlock the script and prevent strange people like that freshman student from coming at her.After opening the script, she suddenly saw a scene with Lu Zhen in it.\u3010Lu Zhen passed by the pet shop not knowing why. He stopped outside the glass window for a while before going inside the shop. He teased the little animals through the cage.\u3011\u3010Finally, Lu Zhen bought a cat. He wanted to give it to someone. \u3011After seeing this, Chu Yin suddenly remembered something\u2014\u2014In her last life, Lu Zhen gave her a cat.That was the only thing that Chu Yin didn\u2019t resist among all of the gifts that he sent. Because the cat was small and fierce, it resembled a little like herself, who had just been picked up from the countryside.Chu Yin tried to take care of the cat, but there were always some fresh scratches on the back of her hand.Because of that, Lu Zhen took the cat away and kept it for himself.So, is this \u201csomeone\u201d her?Dog man is going back to the original plot! Do you have any bad thoughts?!Ah, ah, no no no no!!Chu Yin pondered for two seconds and then decided to use the precious authority to manually stop the dog man.So she crossed out a word.\u2026The evening breeze was gentle in the early spring.Lu Zhen happened to pass by a pet shop.He had been thinking about it for many days about what she would like.Seeing the cat screaming fiercely in the glass window, Lu Zhen\u2019s heart moved.As he opened the door of the pet shop, the wind chime rang gently.Twenty minutes later, the glass door opened again, and the owner\u2019s enthusiastic voice came out of the door.\u2014\u2014\u201dCome back next time!\u201dLu Zhen came out. He quietly held the warm animal on his body as the evening breeze blew for a while.The little thing on his hand rubbed his arm affectionately, making his heart soft.And then, \u201cwheeze\u201d\u2014\u2014The pig gave a clear cry.After a long while.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes expressionlessly and looked at the thing in his arms.He\u2026why did he buy a pig?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The garden of the Lu family was designed by well-known foreign masters.Now, among the majestic flower garden of the Lu family, a happy pig was running around.Lu Zhen looked at the pig silently. No one could tell what this young master was thinking at the moment.After feeding the pig and washing his hands, he searched the web page: Can a little pig grow bigger?The first results on the web page were these huge words: \u201cWill grow\u201d.Lu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe walked into the garden again. Looking at the lively little pig, he was lost in thought.Grandfather Lu walked over on his crutches. He watched his grandson for a while before he made his presence known. \u201cIf you like, you can raise it and fatten it up. Don\u2019t worry. If it\u2019s too big, there\u2019s enough space at this mansion anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen wanted to explain, but after thinking about it, he decided to forget it, \u201cOkay.\u201dThe grandfather and grandson were speechless for a while. On the warm spring day, they admired the pig side by side for a while.After a while, Grandfather Lu remembered something. He looked at Lu Zhen, \u201cThat last time\u2026have you seen your mother?\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes slightly: \u201cI\u2019ve seen her.\u201dGrandfather Lu sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s been so many years\u2026\u201dSu Yumin, the daughter-in-law of the Lu family, was born from a humble background. Su Yumin was a famous beauty at that time.Despite the family opposition, Lu Zhen\u2019s father married Su Yumin.In Lu Zhen\u2019s memory, his mother was indeed too beautiful. His father often loses his mind because of envy and jealousy. Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know if his family could be considered normal compared to other ordinary families because his family broke apart quickly.His father died in a car accident. His mother became mentally ill and was still recuperating.The most unfortunate thing was that she couldn\u2019t stay near her son. Whenever Lu Zhen gets close, she would appear anxious, uneasy, and would try to stay away from him.Lu Zhen never mentioned it to others. He often went to visit her alone.But because of Su Yumin\u2019s state, he rarely gets close to her. He only watched from outside the ward, a distance away from her. When she\u2019s not inside the room, he would change the flower in her bedside vase.He actually visited her not long ago when he and Lu Linyuan went to visit her that day.But for some reason, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t say it.\u201cHow can a mother not recognize her biological son? If you are free, go and see her more. It\u2019s inconvenient for me to go. She also doesn\u2019t want to see me. I have to let Linyuan run these errands\u2026\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s tone was very light: \u201cDon\u2019t trouble uncle in the future. I can go.\u201d\u201cWell, Lin Yuan\u2019s identity is not suitable either\u2026\u201d Father Lu said before succumbing to a fit of coughs.Lu Zhen hurriedly supported him as he frowned, \u201cI\u2019ll call Dr. Liu to come over.\u201dGrandfather Lu waved his hand. At this moment, a gentle and concerned voice came from behind them, \u201cDad, did you cough again?\u201dLu Linyuan came over and softly patted Grandfather Lu\u2019s back.Grandfather Lu said, \u201cAll right! Don\u2019t worry about this old man. You all can go ahead.\u201dAfter Lu Zhen left, Lu Linyuan talked with the old man for a while. Lu Linyuan walked out of the Lu family mansion after Grandfather Lu finally rested.When he passed by the garden, he saw the little pig slowly walking around.He turned back, glancing around. The servant stepped forward and explained, \u201cIt was bought by the young master.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Linyuan smiled from the bottom of his eyes and asked in great interest, \u201cDid the young master buy it for himself? Or \u2013 for someone else?\u201dThe servant shook his head. \u201cThe young master didn\u2019t mention anything. But he didn\u2019t seem to have any plans of giving it away for the time being.\u201dLu Linyuan let out a \u201chum\u201d then walked out the gate with a light smile before getting inside the car.The assistant handed over a document. Lu Linyuan took it, skimmed it, and suddenly asked, \u201cHow is the young master in school? Is there anything special going on?\u201dThe assistant replied: \u201cThe young master played a famous piano piece at the school art festival.\u201dLu Linyuan raised his eyebrows, smiled, and asked, \u201cWhat about his classmate? Chu Yin?\u201dThe assistant didn\u2019t seem to understand why he suddenly asked a random person. After thinking about it, he replied, \u201cThis girl is also very popular at school. But she has nothing to do with the young master.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2026\u201dLu Linyuan smiled, then waved his hand, signaling the driver to drive out of the mansion.\u201cPay more attention to this child.\u201d\u201cUnderstood, sir.\u201dEver since Chu Yin forced the pig on Lu Zhen that day, she hadn\u2019t received any gift from the dog man.She also secretly observed Lu Zhen for a few days in case the dog man would have any thoughts that he shouldn\u2019t have. She must destroy them as early as she can.But she still couldn\u2019t understand if Lu Zhen was in a good mood or not. Even after raising the pig for days, he was still calm. It made everything confusing. Did he like pigs or not?Chu Yin pondered for a while, but couldn\u2019t understand why Lu Zhen would have thoughts of giving her a gift this time? The previous few times had reasons.For example, she received the pure gold Buddha statue because of her bad luck. While the expensive pen she received was considered a thank-you gift for the cookies. But now, why did he want to give her a gift again?Is it because she was too handsome in men\u2019s clothes during the art festival?She hadn\u2019t noticed this in her last life, but is it possible that the dog man has this habit\u2026?Chu Yin started doubting whether she chose the wrong path of helping Lu Zhen and Liang Yueqi reconnect their love line. Would it have a different effect if Lu Zhen was given a handsome man?It seemed that she needed to use her imagination.But as soon as she went to school, Chu Yin had a headache after seeing a sophomore guy standing in front of her.This young student was named Hao Diao. He was not ugly, but rather like a pure little brother.However, under the April weather, he wore a sleeveless vest, showing two bare, white arms. He looked more like a bald peacock.Hao Diao shyly stood in front of her, \u201cSenior Sister Chu, I know what you were thinking these days.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhat am I thinking?\u201dShe was thinking about whether to choose language or economy as a good elective course.Hao Diao blinked with his pair of big eyes: \u201cYou\u2019re thinking of me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin was silent for a second, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t even consider you.\u201dHao Diao wanted to cry: \u201cIt must be that I\u2019m not good enough.\u201dChu Yin was heartless, \u201cGlad that you know.\u201dHao Diao: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t take all of this. Can\u2019t I get just an ounce of pity from you?Hao Diao planned to continue acting pitifully but he was suddenly hit by someone from the side. He bounced out in waves and screamed, \u201cWhat the!\u201dHan Chuying blocked Chu Yin silently, and said righteously: \u201cSmelly man! Don\u2019t make my Sister Yin suffer!\u201dWith that, she helped Chu Yin escape.Hao Diao was so angry that he stomped his feet three times \u2013 where did this little bitch come from!Han Chuying entered the school building with Chu Yin while giving her good information, \u201cHao Diao is popular among gay guys since he is really good-looking.\u201dChu Yin \u201c\u2026I don\u2019t understand.\u201dHan Chuying knew a lot of things. Chu Yin sometimes suspected that she was a genius \u2013 otherwise, how could she stay up-to-date on all of the gossip and still get second place on exams??\u201cAnyway, there are a lot of gay students in this school. This time because you are so handsome, they turned their attention to you.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cShould I be honored?\u201d\u201cNo need!\u201d Han Chuying sent her off at the door of Class 5. Before going away, she seriously advised, \u201cSister, don\u2019t be seduced by these stinky men \u2013 oh \u2013 and sisters.\u201dChu Yin nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201dShe didn\u2019t plan to do so.It\u2019s enough to deal with a dog man.Han Chuying continued: \u201c\u2013In this way, your beauty is still public property! Everyone can appreciate it!\u201dA few girls who passed by nodded after hearing this passionate sentence.\u201cYes, yes!\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t love me, don\u2019t love others.\u201dChu Yin: Excuse me?The flowers were blooming under the warm weather of the spring. The courses of this semester were much more detailed than the last semester.Huiwen invited specialized teachers to teach the physical education classes. Because of this, this course became the most heated topic for the students.\u201cSister Yin, what course will you choose?\u201d Song Zhaolin asked.Most of the students in the class were curious. They also wanted to take the same course as Chu Yin. Zhao Yuxiong and some other students tilted slightly, letting their ears face the side.Chu Yin\u2019s attitude towards physical education was very traditional \u2013 that is, it\u2019s good if you can paddle, but if you can\u2019t paddle, you also have to paddle even if you can\u2019t.She didn\u2019t have to take PE classes with many people in them. It would affect her learning quality.\u201cDon\u2019t ask.\u201d Chu Yin pulled Song Zhaolin\u2019s head aside.Zhao Yuxiong and the others turned back in disappointment.Song Zhaolin: \u201cI\u2019ll give you my recommendations. There are more handsome little brothers in the fencing course, more beautiful sisters in the tennis course, and more foolish male students in the basketball course.\u201dZhao Yuxiong, who was eavesdropping, felt instantly insulted, \u201cDamn you, Lin Zi!\u201d1Song Zhaolin raised his face slightly.While watching the course elective system on her mobile phone, Chu Yin sighed, \u201cLin Lin, it\u2019s a miracle that you have lived to this day without being killed.\u201dChapter 41 \u2013 Take responsibility for the piglet (2)Chu Yin could directly see the number of students in each elective course. As Song Zhaolin said, fencing and tennis were popular courses. As Chu Yin reviewed all the courses, she took fancy to a class which only had eight people present\u2013Sanda Class\u00a01Song Zhaolin peeked at the course that Chu Yin had clicked and almost spat out his saliva.Sister Yin!After the successful prompt on her phone, Chu Yin immediately felt that the quality of learning in this PE course was guaranteed. She was very satisfied.PE classes started the next day after the course selection system closed.Song Zhaolin took the tennis class with the most beautiful women. Jiang Yan chose table tennis. No one in Class 5 had the same class as Chu Yin.To be sure, Chu Yin looked at the script and found that Lu Zhen hadn\u2019t chosen Sanda Class either. She was very satisfied with everything.\u2014\u2014Until she saw Hao Diao in front of the Sanda Classroom.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dGet me out here, system!Xueji: *squeaked*Chu Yin: \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Hao Diao written in the script? Are you looking at cannon fodders?\u201dXueji: \u201cYou\u2019re bullying me.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dHao Diao didn\u2019t know that Chu Yin was in this course. He came here because he wanted to feel fiercer. The moment he saw Chu Yin, he even felt a rejuvenated intense fighting spirit.His heart was moved, \u201cOh my god, my senior sister is so handsome! Ah!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dMost of the students who took Sanda classes were boys. They all knew Chu Yin and never expected to see her here.Even if Hao Diao wanted to come over to her after warming up, he was moved by Chu Yin\u2019s learning spirit of answering math problems in her free time.It was not until the course was over that Hao Diao grabbed Chu Yin who was in the middle of packing her exercise books.\u201cSenior sister, you didn\u2019t practice well what the teacher taught us just now.\u201d Hao Diao showed his white arms, his eyes showed some teasing, \u201cWould you like to practice it with me?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d If you try it, I\u2019ll smash your head.Hao Diao saw the rejection and subtle anger in her eyes, so he looked away. As a result, he caught a glimpse of the fencing class outside the window.\u201cOh my God, I saw Lu Zhen!\u201d Hao Diao screamed, \u201cStill so handsome!\u201dChu Yin encouraged expectantly, \u201cThen go find him! Go!\u201dHao Diao admired the school apollo. He sighed and said, \u201cNo, he\u2019s way over my league.\u201dChu Yin smiled and looked at him: \u201cThen am I better than Lu Zhen?\u201dHao Diao: \u201cNo, no.\u201dChu Yin patted his shoulder, her lips curled as she smiled: \u201cCome on, brother. You just have to try.\u201dOutside the Sanda Hall, Song Zhaolin scurried around with a racket in his arms, just in time to see Lu Zhen.\u201cBrother Zhen, let\u2019s go and see Sister Yin\u2019s Sanda fighting!\u201dLu Zhen raised his eyebrows.Song Zhaolin\u2019s voice immediately attracted many people. Chu Yin\u2019s identity was well-known all over the campus. At this time, many passers-by were Chu Yin\u2019s die-hard fans.In the end, a group of people rushed to the Sanda hall and watched over the door.Two people were sparring against each other in the field \u2013 one was Chu Yin and the other one was a freshman student.The onlookers suddenly became excited!\u201cWhat great timing!\u201d\u201cAh!!! Chu Yin is about to fight! Chu Yin is about to fight!\u201dLu Zhen and Song Zhaolin walked into the field and sat down in an inconspicuous corner.Song Zhaolin whispered, \u201cThis is the gay younger brother who likes Chu Yin.\u201dLu Zhen frowned slightly and looked at the boy opposite Chu Yin.Hao Diao felt Chu Yin was making a fool of herself at this time. When Chu Yin invited him to fight her, he had already regarded it as a victory! After all, this kind of close combat which would result in more physical contact meant that Chu Yin had opened her heart to him, even a little!In terms of skill, it would be impossible for Chu Yin to learn Sanda professionally.Hao Diao felt this was fun.He put on his gloves, magnificently shook his hair, and said with a look of seduction, \u201cCome on Senior Sister~\u201dChu Yin tightened the velcro on her wrist and nodded: \u201cBreak time is limited so let\u2019s end this fight quickly.\u201dHao Diao was still waving at the people who came to watch them, \u201cYin yin, they don\u2019t want it to end fast.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cThen I\u2019ll do it.\u201dThe audience: \u201cAh!!! They\u2019re starting!!~\u201dSong Zhaolin was also excited: \u201cGood luck!!!\u201dThe distance between them narrowed in an instant. Chu Yin\u2019s back foot was light, and her body weight moved forward immediately. Before Hao Diao\u2019s hand touched her clothes, he was hit by a neat backhand straight punch, which landed heavily on his waist and abdomen!\u201cBang!\u201dHao Diao flew out.This trick was taught to her by Lu Zhen in her last life. It was easy plus it worked well.Chu Yin retracted her fist: \u201cHurry up, silly brother.\u201dThe audience was surprised that just after the match started, it was already over!\u2014\u2014The whole match was less than ten seconds!By the time Song Zhaolin came to his senses, there were howls inside and outside of the venue.Lu Zhen sat aside, smiling as he clapped.He was almost sure that Chu Yin was trained. Moreover, she was smart. Knowing that she wouldn\u2019t be able to win in terms of strength, she chose to fight him with speed.Lu Zhen knew she wasn\u2019t the type of girl he likes.But\u2026He raised his hand and touched his heart that was beating uncontrollably fast.Next to him, Song Zhaolin laughed: \u201cFrom now on, those brothers will never harass her again!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips curled: \u201cYes.\u201dSong Zhaolin went on to say proudly, \u201cThen I am the one who has the best relationship with Sister Yin!\u201dAfter saying this, the air suddenly became cold.Song Zhaolin shivered, and then he heard Lu Zhen softly ask: \u201cWhat relationship?\u201dHe inexplicably trembled and said in a flash of inspiration, \u201cFather and son relationship!\u201dLu Zhen was quiet for two seconds and suddenly laughed.Song Zhaolin: \u201cWhat, what\u2019s wrong!\u201dLu Zhen smiled and looked at him: \u201cThen, doesn\u2019t the son need a mother2?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cAh?\u201d\u2014Ah???\u2026[Midnight]Song Zhaolin played with his phone until late at night. He pulled the quilt over him after reluctantly putting his phone aside and closing his eyes peacefully.Time to sleep, time to sleep.The room was quiet.[2:00 AM]\u2014\u2014A male mother!These three characters exploded from his mind, and Song Zhaolin instantly opened his eyes.What did he mean??Song Zhaolin stared at the ceiling, pondering for a long time, and suddenly had a flash of inspiration-Could it be?!Brother Zhen?? Likes Sister Yin??When he thought about it, he had long felt that there was something going on between them!Song Zhaolin\u2019s heart was beating rapidly: My God! What\u2019s this big news!If this gets out, how many people\u2019s houses would collapse?!When these two famous tectonic plates collide, Huiwen would probably usher in a magnitude 8 earthquake!!!Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t sleep at all.He bit the quilt and wonderingly thought: Should I tell Sister Yin or not!Ever since being knocked to the ground that day, Hao Diao hadn\u2019t bothered Chu Yin for several days.It might be because Chu Yin broke his maiden heart with a fist and manually crumbled his shaky sexual orientation.From then on, the violent and beautiful image of Chu Yin was deeply rooted in the hearts of the students. The number of people who sent love letters and small gifts declined each day.Chu Yin thought as she worked on the questions \u2013\u00a0This is great!Except for Song Zhaolin\u2019s occasional disturbance, her peaceful campus life was finally back!After observing Song Zhaolin\u2019s weird and fidgety actions, Chu Yin finally turned her attention towards him.What do you want to say??Chu Yin sighed: \u201cLinlin.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong!\u201dDid Sister Yin see anything???Chu Yin\u2019s eyes showed distress as she gently said to him, \u201c9 out of 10 people have hemorrhoids. Don\u2019t be afraid if you get them. Remember to apply medicine every day.\u201dWith that, Chu Yin left to protect Song Zhaolin\u2019s dignity.It took Song Zhaolin a long time to recover.?? No!I don\u2019t have hemorrhoids!!Forget it. He doesn\u2019t dare to care about this. Let Brother Zhen do it himself!\u2026During the weekend, Chu Yin was dragged by Chu Shi to take a walk in the community.Because Chu Yin studies every day locked up in her room, Chu Shi was afraid that she would suffocate.There was a small garden in the center of the area. Usually, the wealthy ladies nearby would come out to walk their dogs and chat there.When Chu Shi took her out, many wealthy ladies recognized him and greeted him with a smile. Since Chu Yin was rather shy and didn\u2019t like to socialize, Chu Shi patted her hand and asked her to walk around the garden.Chu Yin slid to the side and saw a big, fluffy, well-behaved dog lying on the ground, sticking out his tongue to look at her. Chu Yin couldn\u2019t hold back and squat down.The big soft dog panted as he happily nuzzled his face into her hands.Chu Yin\u2019s heart melted in an instant. With a cry in her heart, she hugged the dog tightly.At this moment, another one came running from behind her.Chu Yin thought that it would also be a large dog from its footsteps.She scratched the dog\u2019s chin before getting up to meet the next one.Who knew that as soon as she turned around, she heard the crisp cry of a pig.\u201cAh!\u2013\u201dA round, silly, pink piglet leaped happily towards her.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026?\u201dPiggy rushed to her leg. It bumped its head in the process and fell to the ground on its back as a result.Its pink belly was in plain sight, not moving.Chu Yin: So shiny\u2026I want to touch it.Behind the pig was a black-haired young man slowly walking over in a casual hoodie.Chu Yin pointed to the piglet, then at herself before waving her hand and defended, \u201cI didn\u2019t do it.\u201dWhat was the saying? You have to pay back what you owe. She never expected that the pig she sent to Lu Zhen would appear in front of her in this circumstance,Lu Zhen was smiling: \u201cChu Yin, you knocked her down.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cShe fell on her own!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s dark pupil shone brightly. He looked at her with the corner of his lips raised, \u201cYou should take responsibility for the piglet.\u201dChu Yin was shocked.Lu Zhen: ??Are you acting like a green-tea\u00a03!You\u2019re shameless!!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/I Am Not Fit to Be the Male Lead\u2019s First LoveCH 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 42 \u2013 I kill you (1) 1To prove that she had nothing to do with the accident, Chu Yin squatted down and squeezed the piglet\u2019s belly.\u201cWake up, ah, wake up.\u201dThe paralyzed piglet rolled on the ground. Its big eyes revealed an inexplicable cuteness.Chu Yin: ?? See, this piglet is fine!Do you know who your dad\u00a02\u00a0is? That\u2019s not how you treat your creator!As soon as she thought of this, Chu Yin suddenly realized that she was scolding herself. She was glad that she only complained in her heart.But she could still feel that dog man, Lu Zhen, was smiling deeper.Chu Yin continued to give little massages to the piglet, trying to get it to stand up and make it walk two steps away, but it was very stubborn.Finally, Lu Zhen lowered his head and said, \u201cGet up.\u201dThe little piglet hummed happily as it flexibly turned over.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe patted her legs and stood up, her gaze lingering on Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen raised his eyebrows lightly: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dChu Yin praised: \u201cYou are really good at controlling pigs.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen was silent for a moment, \u201cJust okay.\u201dThe piglet ran happily between them. The corner of the garden in the area was very empty. The wind carried a trace of begonia fragrance as petals quietly fell.Lu Zhen glanced at Chu Yin and coughed softly: \u201cYou don\u2019t need to take responsibility for the pig. Just give her a name.\u201dChu Yin was surprised: \u201cIs it fine for me to name your pig?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Lu Zhen attentively looked at her.Chu Yin somehow remembered the little cat that she wasn\u2019t able to raise in her last life. After Lu Zhen took the little cat away, the scratches on her hand gradually healed, yet there was a trace of regret in her heart.\u201cThen call it Box.\u201d Chu Yin said.This was the cat\u2019s name since Lu Zhen gave it to her in a box.Since the cat didn\u2019t appear in this life, this name now belonged to the pig.\u201cOkay.\u201dLu Zhen looked down at the little pig at his feet, then retracted his gaze to look at the girl in front of him.When everyone enthusiastically expressed their love to her, he felt flustered and anxious. An unexplainable feeling of discomfort would accumulate in the bottom of his heart, like a layer of burnt ashes.He felt he had to do something. Even if there was no result.Lu Zhen slightly tightened his back, realizing that his heart rate was a bit chaotic.Feeling the slight panic, Young Master Lu noticed that his voice was slightly low, \u201cChu Yin\u2013\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips opened: \u201cI\u2026\u201d\u2013 \u201cXiao Yin!\u201dLu Zhen hadn\u2019t finished his words when Chu Shi\u2019s voice rang.Chu Yin looked at Lu Zhen suspiciously before raising her hand towards Chu Shi: \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dAfter Chu Shi communicated with several wealthy ladies, he couldn\u2019t find Chu Yin. He followed the voice and saw at a glance that his sister was standing with a dangerous figure, Lu Zhen!The alarm bell suddenly rang in his heart as he hurriedly strode over to where Chu Yin was.Although the bastard Lu Zhen hadn\u2019t done anything yet to his Xiao Yin, his younger sister\u2019s popularity in school was still surprisingly high.Chu Shi took his dream seriously, that\u2019s why he was acting like this.The Lu family\u2019s business empire would become even more powerful in the future. Even with this knowledge, Chu Shi didn\u2019t want Chu Yin to get involved with Lu Zhen. He wanted her to continue living dazzlingly.Lu Zhen\u2019s expression turned cold at the moment Chu Shi appeared.His icy black eyes showed irritation.Both people looked at each other for a second, not bothering to hide their hostility.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Chu Shi asked with a smile.Lu Zhen was too lazy to answer, so Chu Yin replied instead: \u201cOh, we\u2019re just talking about his pig.\u201dChu Shi: \u201c?\u201dHe looked down and found that it was a real pig.\u201cYoung Master Lu is so refined!\u201d Chu Shi gave a thumbs up.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t seem to hear his sarcasm, and said quietly: \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cOkay, Xiao Yin, it\u2019s time to go home.\u201d Chu Shi gave Lu Zhen a triumphant glance.After Chu Yin agreed, the brother and sister pair left together.Lu Zhen silently watched their backs walk away, then retracted his gaze and looked down.After a while, he bent over to pick up the overweight pig and touched its belly.\u201cCome on, Box.\u201d\u00a0I\u2019ll tell her next time.Song Zhaolin paid close attention to everything because he was worried. Since there wasn\u2019t anything unusual with Sister Yin\u2019s and Brother Zhen\u2019s actions, Song Zhaolin hadn\u2019t noticed anything.Song Zhaolin:\u00a0Why are you not making a move!\u00a0He is so anxious!He felt excited that he was the only person who knew about this big secret.As Chu Yin was putting away her notebook, she saw Song Zhaolin from the side scratching his head in silence.\u201cLinlin,\u201d Chu Yin asked, \u201c\u2026that, are you sick?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dChu Yin covered her mouth and whispered: \u201cNine out of ten people have it.\u201dSong Zhaolin was at a loss.Chu Yin thought he was pretending to be stupid and was embarrassed to talk about it, so she didn\u2019t ask again.She stood up from her seat while holding a math notebook. Song Zhaolin suddenly held her back, \u201cOh, Sister Yin!\u201dHe hesitated for two seconds before he vaguely said, \u201cDo you know! Someone wants to be my mother!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c?\u201dSong Zhaolin continued, \u201cThe most important thing is, you know this \u2018someone\u2019!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c??\u201dSong Zhaolin blinked his round eyes, looking at her expectantly.Chu Yin\u2019s expression gradually became regrettable: \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t expect your family to be messy.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c??\u201dChu Yin thought that since she \u2018knew\u2019 this mother, she must be young.She kindly touched Song Zhaolin\u2019s head: \u201cDon\u2019t be upset. You can fix this together with your father or mother.\u201dAfter speaking, Chu Yin sighed and left.Rich families are really messed up. Tsk tsk.Song Zhaolin was left alone to think about the problem again.Chu Yin was invited by her math group seniors to share her experience in the competition. This would give a great advantage to the liberal arts department in the future.Although the Hope Cup Competition was over, Chu Yin still remembered the mood during the winter camp.There were two winners this year but she was the only one who was invited by the math group because of two reasons. One, she was the gold winner. Two, the seniors didn\u2019t dare to invite the young master.Chu Yin passionately agreed, saying that it was fine to go alone.If this person was invited, it would affect her performance.The sharing session\u2019s location was in the comprehensive classroom of the first year of high school, which was quite a big room. Most of the people who came to listen were students who wanted to choose liberal arts in the future. Some people specifically came to see Chu Yin.Chu Yin saw student Hao Diao at the door of the classroom.After the last incident with Chu Yin, he couldn\u2019t stand up. His abdomen would be in pain again every time he sees her beautiful face.He also started wearing normal clothes and wasn\u2019t deliberately showing his white arms anymore. Instead, he wore a hoodie just like the other students. Chu Yin now saw that he didn\u2019t have those lustrous and passionate eyes anymore.\u201cYou too?\u201d She asked kindly.Hao Diao subconsciously stood straighter: \u201cSenior sister!\u201dChu Yin nodded and waved her fingers: \u201cDon\u2019t be nervous.\u201dThe white and slender fingertips flashed past his eyes. There was no expression on her beautiful face. There was an inexplicable calmness in her.Hao Diao: Ah ah!! So handsome!He thought that the chicken would crow again.\u00a03\u201cSenior Sister, don\u2019t look at me like that. I actually study pretty well.\u201d Hao Diao explained.Chu Yin was a little surprised: \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201dt/n: I\u2019m sorry for not posting chapters. I was trying to fix my site with the errors I constantly get every 2-3 months or so.Chapter 42 \u2013 I kill you (2)\u201cI am now determined to pursue you, so I\u2019ll study harder,\u201d Hao Diao clenched his fist. \u201cIn this way, I will become excellent \u2013 my fierce love will finally be worthy of you.\u201dChu Yin was very pleased before she heard the last part of his speech: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWith that, Hao Diao walked into the classroom passionately. He sat at the edge of his seat in the front of the classroom and then watched the podium with great energy.As soon as Chu Yin walked through the door, there were waves of applause and cheers.\u201cSenior sister is good!!\u201d\u201cSenior sister has worked hard!\u201dChu Yin touched the tip of her nose. She didn\u2019t know what to say, so she only smiled back.\u201cAh ah ah ah, she smiled!\u201d\u201cIs it for me?!\u201d\u201cI heard that the winter camp will invite the previous champions. Oh oh! I want to participate for my Sister Yin!\u201dBecause of the high enthusiasm of the audience, the atmosphere while Chu Yin spoke was very good.\u201cThis is the main knowledge framework I learned in the Hope Cup Winter Camp this year. It\u2019s worth reminding everyone that if you plan to participate in the competition, you must start learning in advance.\u201d Chu Yin\u2019s transparent eyes swept under the stage, \u201cDon\u2019t be like me. Since my foundation is relatively poor, I spent more effort to catch up.\u201dAudience: Can you even believe what she\u2019s saying?!She won the gold medal yet says she has a poor foundation!!But this humble sister is still beautiful..TAT.After the sharing meeting, Chu Yin stayed to answer several questions from the audience.Among the people who came over, some admired Chu Yin. She recognized two of those that had given her love letters.It wasn\u2019t until the teacher came and pulled away the overly enthusiastic students that Chu Yin was able to finally breathe.Hao Diao waited outside the classroom and handed her a bottle of mineral water.Chu Yin sighed and took a sip.\u201cSenior Sister, I learned about this later. No wonder Lu Zhen favors you.\u201dChu Yin drank water as her eyebrows raised in surprise.\u2013What? Why did you mention this suddenly?Hao Diao\u2019s eyes bulged, expressing his gossiping look: \u201cIs it because Lu Zhen likes you?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cPuff!\u2013\u201cShe spat the water out directly.Hao Diao was taken aback. But because he was an elegant boy, he always had tissues with him. He quickly took out a beautifully-printed tissue and handed it to her.Chu Yin finally calmed down, her expression frightened.\u201cWho made the rumor?\u201d \u2014Who dares ruin the reputation she painstakingly built!Hao Diao counted with his fingers, \u201cBecause everyone pays attention to you. Some people said that when you first transferred, Brother Zhen called to talk to you. Then he scolded a few classmates for you in the forum. At the sport\u2019s event, some students saw you together. Plus you went to Province B together and won the prize together \u2013 Oh my god!\u201dBesides Chu Yin x Lu Zhen, there were many other CPs, such as Chu Yin x Gu Qiuze. Even a few contacts together could have meaning \u2013 Chu Yin cheering for Gu Qiuze during the basketball game? Discussing topics together? And meeting in Province B by accident?Chu Yin: I need to be more careful.She left with a solemn and calm expression.Hao Diao felt it was strange.Sure enough, Senior Sister Chu is the real deal! He could never reach this level even in his lifetime!The school really cared about Chu Yin\u2019s preferences.It has become a habit of the students to idolize famous people. After all, there were only a few girls that could reach this kind of status in the school.Several people who openly pursued Chu Yin all ended up in failure. Apart from that, she hadn\u2019t responded to any other advances from others.This matter is often discussed in various anonymous groups:[I really can\u2019t think of who Sister Chu would like][I\u2019m sorry to all the CPs, but I don\u2019t believe these would come true][I only believe Chu Yin x Me][@above post, shameless!!!]\u2026[Latest news! I just saw the top student\u00a01\u00a0talking with the top student\u00a02\u00a0in third-year seniors\u2019 corridor][What?? Will both my husband and wife marry now??]After a few minutes, the seller of melon-seeds came back\u2013[Although they chatted for more than ten minutes, it had nothing to do with romance. I can\u2019t catch any sugar because they\u2019re just talking about xxx theorems!][What is this xxx? ][I don\u2019t know. If I understood, do you think I\u2019ll be using xxx? *angry. jpg*][I know, my sister doesn\u2019t love anyone]Chu Yin didn\u2019t know about these discussions at all.After Hao Diao\u2019s remarks, she secretly observed Lu Zhen.There was nothing unusual when she thought about it carefully. It seemed that recently the frequency of Lu Zhen showing up was high.She knew that the plot was completely biased. She couldn\u2019t influence Lu Zhen\u2019s thoughts and feelings.Chu Yin thought angrily that she would never submit to her character as the short-lived white moonlight in this life. Now that she had superpowers in her hands, she could make Lu Zhen be the one to live a short life rather than her if he ever tries anything!My dark shark soul is burning again.jpgXueji: \u201cDing! the system detected the host\u2019s intention to kill, which is not conducive to the healthy mind of a person~\u201dChu Yin snorted, \u201cI am healthy!\u201dOriginally, she thought this would be just another daily quarrel with the system until Xueji said, \u201cA gentle reminder! Due to the great changes in the script, some stimulating behaviors may cause special fluctuations in this world\u201dChu Yin was taken aback. \u201cWhat special fluctuation?\u201dXueji: \u201cThis system can\u2019t predict at the moment.\u201dWith how Xueji was acting vaguely, Chu Yin\u2019s thoughts were immediately triggered.Special fluctuations\u2026at present, the biggest special fluctuation in this world should be herself \u2013 a character who was bound to the script with cheats.Will this fluctuation continue if she continues to change the script?\u201cWill you be bound to others?\u201d Chu Yin immediately grasped the deadliest question.Xueji: \u201cThe ability to modify the script is only available to the host.\u201dChu Yin was slightly relieved.Since she alone could change the script, she still had an absolute advantage.Chu Yin thought that she needed to be more cautious when evading and adjusting the original plot.When the head teacher walked into the classroom, she happened to see Chu Yin holding her arms, frowning and looking thoughtful.She was immediately moved and relieved \u2013 look! The child is radiating the light of wisdom!It was a miracle\u00a0 for other students to study hard, but for Chu Yin, she even had to persuade her not to put too much stress on herself.The head teacher gently patted Chu Yin\u2019s shoulder: \u201cYou should take breaks\u00a0 between classes. Don\u2019t tire yourself.\u201dChu Yin put away the things that made her mind ache: \u201cI know, Teacher. I\u2019m not tired.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to tell you that the tutoring class organized by Huiwen every year is about to start.\u201dIn the second half of high school, the whole city entered the joint examination mode. The neighboring school and first middle school would be participating in this event. One school was prestigious and powerful, while the other had high-quality students. They were considered major competitors every year. The comprehensive ranking and individual subjects would be compared.First graders like Chu Yin were the highlights of the school.Chu Yin\u2019s achievement of winning the gold medal for the city-level English competition and provincial-level math competition made her a student that the school desperately wanted to showcase.Getting good results in the city\u2019s competition would letHuiwen\u2019s educational resources gradually shift in favor of their students. They would not only provide good teachers, but also high-quality course and reading materials.Chu Yin remembered this event in her previous life. This had nothing to do with her before. Now that she knew how important these top-notch resources were, she wanted to join. \u201cGood teacher, can I take the exam?\u201dShe found that she particularly liked rankings. If she did poorly in the exam, it would motivate her to do better. It\u2019s a pity that Huiwen didn\u2019t have any monthly exams like other schools.The headteacher was very pleased with her attitude: \u201cOf course.\u201dChu Yin nodded, \u201cThank you, teacher.\u201dIn this tutorial class, Han Chuying, Jiang Yan, and the others would be admitted. It\u2019s good to be together.Han Chuying soon heard the news of the tutoring class. She was super excited. After all, she could be in the same class as Chu Yin. What a wonderful event!!Han Chuying told Chu Yin, \u201cOur school won the gold medal in the Hope Cup, but there will be students who won prizes in foreign math competitions every year. Yin Yin will have to fight them. Jiayou!Chu Yin felt challenged, \u201cThen I have to work hard.\u201dEven though her grades were good, she\u2019s still working hard.Unlike the midterm final exam, this was a complete competition between the smart students. This class would only accept 30 students.\u201cWhat about my task?\u201d Chu Yin poked the system.Xueji: \u201cThis assessment is not included in the system task~\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin said, \u201cStingy chicken.\u201dXueji: \u201cI can\u2019t hear you~\u201dThis assessment was scheduled for every Friday afternoon. Volunteers could sign up for the examination. The examination room was randomly arranged.When Chu Yin walked into the examination room, all heads turned to her. Their eyes were unilaterally saying, \u2018sit here, sit here.\u2019Chu Yin touched the tip of her nose as she sat in the first row.The surrounding students were excited\u2013Ah! I\u2019m breathing the same air as the boss! I feel like I\u2019m getting smarter!As Han Chuying hastily came into the classroom, she found that the seats around Chu Yin were already occupied. She loudly wailed, \u201cWhat is this!\u201dChu Yin smiled, \u201cThis will be over soon.\u201dHan Chuying unhappily sat down in a vacant seat.After a while, another person walked into the classroom.Chu Yin coincidentally glanced up and met Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes.Chapter 42 \u2013 I kill you (3)Because of this, there was a little commotion in the classroom.\u201cWow\u2014\u201d\u201cBrother Zhen is here too?!\u201d\u201cBrother Zhen has been studying a lot!\u201dSince Chu Yin was sitting, Lu Zhen could see her as soon as he lowered his head. Her brown hair looked very soft and cute.Lu Zhen squeezed his knuckles. He was about to say something when someone suddenly came behind him.\u2014\u2014\u201dXiao Yin, has the exam started yet?\u201dChu Yin looked up and saw her brother\u2019s face: \u201cNot yet.\u201dLu Zhen closed his eyes. His good upbringing made him unable to roll his eyes.Chu Shi also saw Lu Zhen: \u201cWhat is Master Lu doing here?\u201dLu Zhen glanced at him coldly, then moved his gaze back as he lightly tapped his fingertips on Chu Yin\u2019s desk: \u201cCan you wait for me after the exam?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s alarm immediately sounded in her heart: \u201cWhat do you want?\u201dLu Zhen lowered his head slightly, pursed his lips, and smiled: \u201cThere is\u2026something.\u201dChu Yin stared at him for a while.The girl\u2019s eyes were bright and clear that Lu Zhen could even see her anxiousness in them.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes trembled lightly as he raised his eyes to meet hers again, a smile forming on his face.\u201cGo on. It\u2019s time for the exam\u201d After he softly spoke, he went to find his seat.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter! Hey\u2014\u201d Chu Shi unhappily stared at Lu Zhen who casually sat down in the classroom.He wanted to say something, but the exam proctor had already walked in with the papers.He didn\u2019t want to delay Chu Yin anymore, so he said: \u201cI\u2019ll come over after school.\u201dChu Yin nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d\u201cPut away all your phones and books! I\u2019ll start distributing the papers!\u201dChu Yin pressed down other thoughts to focus on the exam in front of her.The examination time was not long. It only took 40 minutes for one subject.The difficulty of the mathematics was so high that even the top students found it hard. The girl sitting behind Chu Yin had been scratching her hair since the examination began.But for those who participated in a competition, this level of difficulty was not enough.It only took Chu Yin half an hour to finish the math papers smoothly.When a few students saw that she was calmly putting down her pen, their hearts tightened \u2014 Ahhh! It suddenly felt like sitting near Chu Yin wasn\u2019t good!The pressure is too much!There was only one break between the six subject exams.When it reached the last subject, which was politics, sighs of relief could be heard in the classroom.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d\u201cAll other subjects are okay except for mathematics.\u201d\u201cThe college entrance exam last year was difficult.\u201d\u201cHow do I find this more difficult than last year\u2019s?\u201dChu Yin moved her shoulder and neck slightly, then turned to see Jiang Yan, Han Chuying, and the others. Although they were a little tired, their expressions were relatively stable.She was relieved. When she realized that Lu Zhen was no longer in the classroom, she remembered what the dog man had said to her before the exam.Does he even have anything to say between them?Chu Yin hugged her arms as she remembered Lu Zhen\u2019s face a while ago.Various information then poured into her heart as she had an ominous premonition.Isn\u2019t it? No way??As the people in the classroom left one by one, Jiang Yan and Han Chuying came over and asked Chu Yin to go with them, but she refused.She was afraid to leave the classroom not knowing what Lu Zhen\u2019s intentions were. He might be waiting somewhere outside the classroom.Chu Yin thought for a long time before deciding to open the script.\u3010Chu Shi packed up his things while saying to Gu Qiuze who was next to him, \u201cDo you want to go with me to see Xiao Yin?\u201d]Gu Qiuze: \u201cThere\u2019s an essay I haven\u2019t finished yet, so I will be finishing late\u2026\u201dChu Shi: \u201cThen I can\u2019t wait for you \u2013 Lu Zhen is looking for my sister after school.\u201dGu Qiuze smiled: \u201cWhy are you so defensive towards Lu Zhen\u2026\u201d\u3011Even her brother noticed that there was something wrong with Lu Zhen?Chu Yin\u2019s heartbeat became a little faster.\u3010Lu Zhen left the classroom early and waited outside for Chu Yin. The afternoon sun was beautiful. He stood under the light and shadow, his expression was inexplicably soft.\u3011\u3010He had a very important thing to say.\u3011Game over. It\u2019s the end.A shock of thunder flashed across Chu Yin\u2019s heart, she then understood that-This dog man Lu Zhen??I want to kill you!Although Chu Yin\u2019s thoughts were complicated, she knew how to prevent this from happening. If she didn\u2019t, the plot would be going towards the same route as her last life!Calm down, calm down!\u2014\u2014First, avoid Lu Zhen!She looked around the script, noticing that the garbage script didn\u2019t include Lu Zhen\u2019s location.Chu Yin: \u201cSo, according to this plot, I\u2019ll meet him no matter where I go?\u201dXue Ji said regretfully, \u201cIt seems so.\u201dChu Yin hit the air with anger. Fortunately, everyone in the classroom was gone, and no one saw her raging moment.Is it necessary to use her single sentence permission?\u00a0Chu Yin stared at the script as she read it over and over again before finally having an idea.She grabbed the pen and fell on the sentence [waited outside for Chu Yin].Brother should be on his way to find her now.Chu Yin lowered her eyes: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe hesitated for a second then crossed out her name \u201cYin\u201d and changed it to \u201cShi\u201dSorry.\u2026Lu Zhen stood in the corner on the first floor of the school building, with his back against the wall.It had been a long time since the exam ended. The candidates left the building one after another. Lu Zhen saw the two friends of Chu Yin. They talked and laughed as they walked away.He raised his eyes and saw that there was no one behind them.Is she still taking the exam?Lu Zhen slightly stretched his neck.It doesn\u2019t matter. He could wait for her as long as her brother wouldn\u2019t come out to disturb them again.After a long time of waiting, a pair of footsteps could be heard through the empty corridor.The corners of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips curled up lightly as he walked out slowly from the corner.\u2014\u2014Then when he turned around, he was dimly faced with Chu Shi.\u201c?\u201dLu Zhen frowned: \u201cWhere\u2019s Chu Yin?\u201dChu Shi glared at him: \u201cWhere\u2019s my sister?\u201dA few seconds later, they fell into silence.Were they fooled?A figure was seen dashing like the wind outside the school\u2019s iron gate.Chu Yin covered her mouth as she swiftly got inside the car, letting out a long sigh of relief.Sorry, goodbye!

Was she floating on cloud 9 now that the students praised her for being smart?Didn\u2019t she (CY) know that her (CQ) status was higher than her (CY) in the Chu family?Chu Qiuqiu stopped pretending to be a good sister and arrogantly went to another seat with her chin held up high.The instructor came in when the students were all seated.There were a lot of people secretly looking at Chu Yin, who was sitting in the center. She was still wearing the baggy school uniform since the first day she entered school. Surprisingly, more students have started wearing their school uniforms now.They originally thought that Chu Yin would be the type of student who was attentive while sitting in class with her back straight.Who knew that Chu Yin was completely different from their imagination? Her slender shoulders were slightly sloppy, her one hand was resting on her cheeks, while her other hand was leisurely turning the pen.The pen in her white fingertips looked very professional.Chu Yin sat thinking for a while when she suddenly heard the sound of pens falling from the seats behind her.When she looked back in surprise, a few of her classmates blushed.Forget it, they can\u2019t learn her posture at all!!But when Chu Yin turned back, she was so handsome~The instructor walked around the platform with a smile as she gave a simple speech.\u201cEveryone knows that we\u2019re not here to play. The city\u2019s joint exam is coming up soon. You are representing Huiwen. The school will provide you with the best teachers, supplementary materials, and other needs. The school will try its best to meet them.\u201d\u201cThe difficulty will be higher than your original class. If you can\u2019t bear the struggle, you can quit. But once you quit, you can\u2019t enter again.\u201d After speaking, the teacher smiled. \u201cAlthough this is only a temporary class, for the sake of coordination, we will choose a class leader.\u201dAs soon as the teacher\u2019s voice fell, several eyes glanced towards Chu Yin.Chu Yin blinked and subconsciously touched the tip of her nose.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She didn\u2019t like to be controlled by others. In turn, she didn\u2019t want to control others either.But the teacher thought otherwise. Chu Yin, who had excellent grades, was more mature compared to her peers.Apart from her, there was simply no person who was more suitable than her.\u201cThen\u2026Chu Yin, do you accept being the class leader?\u201d The whole class cast their gazes toward her. Chu Yin suddenly felt like standing in a golden sunflower field.\u201c\u2026\u201d She was silent for a moment under the eager gazes of the teacher and classmates.\u201cOkay. I will work hard. Thank you, teacher.\u201dThe whole class immediately applauded.The instructor was very happy. \u201cThen, I\u2019ll give the responsibility of monitoring the class to the class leader.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dThese are just kids\u2026she can do it.Since today was just the first day, the teacher only sent out papers for them to adapt to the academic contents.\u201cThese are all the questions made by the teachers themselves. We will finish them in three days. The teachers will explain the questions in the next tutorial class.\u201dThe class howled.Chu Yin\u2019s face showed eager excitement \u2014 New questions! Wonderful!\u2026\u2026Class 5 classroom at this time.Song Zhaolin sat coldly in his seat.Without his deskmate, he was like a miserable little cabbage. He even began to envy the girls in front of him who were talking animatedly to each other.At this moment, a voice came from the back door of the classroom, calling his name.Song Zhaolin suddenly got excited. He jumped as he rushed over with tears in his years. \u201cBrother Zhen ~ have you come to play with me ~ ~\u201dThere were many good students in Class 5.\u201cLook! Lu Zhen, Lu Zhen!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s also handsome today!\u201d\u201cWhat did he come here for? Is he looking for Linzi?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s gaze went straight to the seat of Chu Yin. Empty.Song Zhaolin flew in front of him with noodle tears.Lu Zhen asked him straight in the face, \u201cWhere\u2019s Chu Yin?\u201dHe almost vomited blood on the spot.\u201cShe\u2019s in the tutorial class\u2013\u201d Song Zhaolin was heartbroken, \u201cDidn\u2019t you come for me! Why! Is your relationship better than our friendship!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s gaze fell on his face, unmoved.Song Zhaollin got terrified.Lu Zhen stared at him for a few seconds. Song Zhaolin unconsciously adjusted his improper posture.Just when he thought Lu Zhen was about to get angry at him, the person in front of him suddenly smiled.\u201cThere\u2019s no relationship,\u201d Lu Zhen quickly smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t ruin the reputation of others.\u201dAfter speaking, he turned towards the tutorial class and left.Song Zhaolin was left standing alone at the back door, idle for two seconds.Then he shouted in his heart: Pig trotters\u00a01, you dummy!I can\u2019t believe this is happening!Lu Zhen wasn\u2019t able to join the class. Although his Mathematics and English were perfect, he hardly scored any points for Chinese.Now he was regretting it.Lu Zhen met several people on the way to the classroom. He quickened his pace and walked to the back door of the classroom.He still couldn\u2019t find Chu Yin.Lu Zhen held on to the door frame of the classroom, his eyes lowered as he sighed helplessly.Why did it feel like she\u2019s hiding?The city\u2019s joint exam was getting closer and closer.Chu Yin knew that her golden finger was working. She hadn\u2019t seen the dog man Lu Zhen for several days. Or maybe he was suddenly caught up by something and couldn\u2019t come to her.\u2014It\u2019s so cool to be an invisible person!Hope this happiness lasts longer!The courses of the tutoring classes were random. Sometimes the specially-appointed teacher would suddenly arrive at school to teach immediately. The pace of the lectures was very fast.The tasks were heavy. Countless papers were issued to them every day. Huiwen wanted to ensure that they would receive enough resources and guidance.Because of the rigid training, one could expect that some students would give up halfway.Under such intensity, only Chu Yin and Han Chuying, who had experience in the competition, could adapt.After another mathematics class, Fu Mingxuan and Chu Qiuqiu laid on the table, doubting life. Liang Yueqi remembered her fear of being dominated in the winter camp.Jiang Yan turned around weakly and looked at Chu Yin and Han Chuying: \u201cDid you also feel this way when you were at the winter camp? I can\u2019t stand it anymore\u2026\u201dHan Chuying was also very tired. She murmured. \u201dThe winter camp was crueler than this. I thought I was dying at that time.\u201dJiang Yan was frightened: \u201cFortunately, you persisted! Excellent!\u201dAmong the crowd of stressed students, Chu Yin stood up and went to ask the teachers some questions. The teacher was very satisfied with this class leader. After they exchanged words, she smiled and took Chu Yin to the teacher\u2019s office to continue the discussion.Jiang Yan looked at her like she was a god: \u201cIt\u2019s Yin Yin\u2026\u201dHan Chuying\u2019s face was covered with heaps of hearts, \u201cShe\u2019s worthy of my goddess~~\u201dAfter a few days, most of the students knew that Chu Yin became the leader of the tutorial class.Since being appointed as a class leader by the teacher, she could lightly talk with the teacher anytime. What kind of spiritual power is this!Looking at Chu Yin, the students gritted their teeth as they picked up their pens. If this girl can do it, then they don\u2019t have any reason to be lazy!What\u2019s more, this joint exam had high expectations. Their achievements and results would affect the school\u2019s honor. They must work hard!But this learning atmosphere was broken by someone.Lu Zhen stood by the back door, his eyes looking around.Fu Mingxuan was, as always, the first to spot him. Her face showed surprise: \u201cBrother Zhen?\u201dLiang Yueqi quickly turned her head after hearing the sound, \u201cLu Zhen? Why are you here?\u201dEveryone in the classroom looked over.Liang Yueqi glanced at Fu Mingxuan, then stood up first. She smiled in a familiar tone: \u201cDo you want to come in and learn?\u201dFu Mingxuan knew that she was deliberately appearing to be \u2018close\u2019 with Lu Zhen. She rolled her eyes, smiled, and said: \u201cYueqi, you are so stupid. Brother Zhen didn\u2019t get on the list of this class. He didn\u2019t come to learn.\u201dAfter being stabbed by Fu Mingxuan, she immediately shot back: \u201cWhy do you always think people are stupid? It\u2019s just a joke amongst us good friends~\u201dFu Mingxuan was mad. When did Lu Zhen become your good friend?The eyes of these two people clashed like a ball of fire.Lu Zhen ignored them.He glanced through his dark pupils and finally landed in the middle of the classroom seat.Lu Zhen recognized Chu Yin\u2019s pencil case, with a rabbit head on it.The seat was empty.There was a slight irritation in Lu Zhen\u2019s heart. Recently, seeing Chu Yin has been difficult.He endured for too long already. He couldn\u2019t bear it any longer.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, his expression very pale. He didn\u2019t want to cause trouble for her so he glanced around and left without speaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She rolled her eyes and chuckled.\u201cXuan Xuan, Yue Qi, why do I feel that Lu Zhen is looking for someone?\u201dFu Mingxuan asked, \u201cWho is it?\u201dLiang Yueqi scolded in her heart.The uneasiness and anxiety in her heart became strong again.The location where Lu Zhen looked just now\u2026 seemed to be Chu Yin\u2019s position.Chu Yin was extremely satisfied when she came out of the teacher\u2019s office.The specially-appointed teacher invited by Huiwen was amazing. The teacher opened her computer to show Chu Yin several files she could study and explained every important point to Chu Yin.\u2014Really satisfying.Chu Yin was in a good mood. She swayed around the corner and suddenly ran into the figure of Lu Zhen not far away. She quickly turned around and hid back, waited for a minute, and made sure that Lu Zhen returned to his classroom before she walked out with confidence.Ha ha ha, dog man.Chu Yin sneaked back to Class 5. She was ready to go back to the tutorial class again after taking her things when Song Zhaolin shouted, \u201cSister Yin\u201dChu Yin looked at him amusedly: \u201cLin Lin, you\u2019re so dramatic. I was just away for two classes.\u201d\u201cOh, right?\u201d Song Zhaolin scratched his head, \u201cWhy do I feel like it has been a long time? It must be because I need you too much!\u201dChu Yin nodded, \u201cI understand. This is the case for children who lack fatherly love.\u201dSong Zhaolin took the opportunity to say, \u201cSo, a qualified father must not be absent from his child\u2019s birthday party, right?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c?\u201dSong Zhaolin blinked with his big eyes: \u201cIt\u2019s my birthday on Sunday! My brother allowed me to have a party at home. Sister Yin, you have to come! \u201cBased on her friendship with Song Zhaolin, she should attend Song Zhaolin\u2019s birthday party!But Song Zhaolin and Lu Zhen were also friends!Chu Yin hesitated: \u201cThis, I\u2019ll pick a gift\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin began to cry like a princess, \u201cYou\u2019re rejecting me! You can\u2019t be this cruel. Brother Zhen has already rejected me wuwuwu. And now, you won\u2019t come!\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows: \u201cHuh? Really?\u201dSong Zhaolin forgot that he was crying crocodile tears, \u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018really\u2019?\u201d\u201cLu Zhen.\u201d Chu Yin hesitated, \u201c\u2026Won\u2019t go?\u201dSong Zhaolin said, \u201cHe needs to attend the board of directors\u2019 opening. I heard from my brother that it\u2019s very important. Brother Zhen also doesn\u2019t know what time it will end.\u201dThere was a sudden movement in Chu Yin\u2019s heart. Why does his brother know about Lu\u2019s internal affairs?She suddenly remembered that she also met Song Yanchuan outside of the examination room the last time Lu Linyuan came.Was this just a coincidence?Chu Yin\u2019s eyebrow twitched, \u201cWell. I can go and stay for a while. I\u2019ll just leave early, okay?\u201d\u201c!\u201d Song Zhaolin smiled slyly, \u201cIt\u2019s fine!\u201dHe\u2019s been bragging about how beautiful and outstanding his deskmate was! If Chu Yin didn\u2019t come to his birthday party, it would be embarrassing! He knew Chu Yin was busy. As long as she could come for a bit, it would save his face!Damn! I\u2019m looking forward to my birthday party!\u2026Chu Yin returned to the tutorial class while pondering the matter in her heart.Most students were consciously writing questions on their seats when the class bell rang.Fu Mingxuan glared at Chu Yin as she whispered something to Liang Yueqi.Chu Yin: \u201c?\u201dShe walked to the podium and opened the cabinet to get the eraser. The low noises in the classroom suddenly stopped.Then Chu Yin turned around with chalk to write the homework assigned by the teacher.After writing three lines of the homework, the noises started again.Fu Mingxuan remembered what Liang Yueqi said awhile ago: Lu Zhen seemed to be looking for Chu Yin. How shameless was Chu Yin to be hooking up with Lu Zhen behind their backs!She and Liang Yueqi deliberately made noises while Chu Yin was on the podium.Chu Yin\u2019s chalk stopped for a moment before she finished in no hurry. She turned around to look at the two.As if Liang Yueqi and Fu Mingxuan didn\u2019t notice her staring, they falsely continued to talk to each other.Chu Yin said, \u201cAre you finished?\u201dHer voice was clear and light. It didn\u2019t sound harsh.Liang Yueqi paused before the discomfort in her heart surged again: \u201cLeader, we\u2019re just discussing today\u2019s topic.\u201dFu Mingxuan: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Aren\u2019t we all here to study? You\u2019re the class leader. You should organize things.\u201dChu Qiuqiu also joined the war. She \u2018gently\u2019 persuaded her sister, \u201cSister, don\u2019t be angry. I can testify that they\u2019re talking about academic matters.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Yin was shocked for a moment because this was the first time that these three two-faced people joined forces.Jiang Yan frowned while Han Chuyin was directly displeased.\u201dEveryone is trying to learn yet you guys are deliberately talking. Didn\u2019t you know that you\u2019re noisy?\u201dLiang Yueqi glanced at her. \u201cIf you think we\u2019re noisy, then leave. Why are you so selfish? Should I be serving you now?\u201d\u201c?\u201d Han Chuying was so angry that she didn\u2019t know what to say.After hearing this, everyone in the class got angry.This special class, of course, was based on grades. Chu Yin\u2019s scores and medals could beat them all. Because of this, most of the students believed that she should lead the class.These two young ladies were openly joining forces, deliberately shaming Chu Yin?!The students\u2019 expressions turned different, while Chu Yin\u2019s expression was very calm.\u201cThen are you finished?\u201d She asked.Fu Mingxuan showed her prideful look. \u201cNo, if you hadn\u2019t disturbed us, we would have finished.\u201dLiang Yueqi also glanced at her: \u201cIs this how you monitor the class?\u201dThe boys in the class couldn\u2019t listen anymore. These girls gathered together to aim at Chu Yin. The class leader is too pitiful!But at this moment, Chu Yin slowly walked off the stage and to their table.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d As soon as the voice fell, Chu Yin suddenly raised her foot and kicked their table.Fu Mingxuan and Liang Yueqi were caught off guard. They were all stunned due to shock as they grabbed their table to stabilize themselves.Chu Yin\u2019s face was expressionless while she asked, \u201cWhat topics need to be discussed? If you have any questions, let me see. If your problem is in your brain, go and see a doctor.\u201dWith that, the class was silent for three seconds.Then this silence was interrupted by Han Chuyin\u2019s laughter.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for laughing but this is too savage hahaha.\u201d\u201cElder sister is so handsome~\u201d\u201cAs expected of Chu Yin!\u201dChu Yin looked back at the whole class and put up her finger: \u201cShh.\u201dThe voices came to an abrupt end.\u201cThere should be no noise during self-study time.\u201d Chu Yin said, \u201cFor those who violate the rules, I can teach not only mathematics but also Sanda.\u201dLiang Yueqi &amp; Fu Mingxuan &amp; Chu Qiuqiu: \u201c!!!\u201dThe whole class was quiet.Because of this, the learning atmosphere was good. The teacher was extremely satisfied when he came in.Chu Yin\u2019s lips curled as she answered the questions.This was her way of disciplining. Gentle was not in her dictionary~What else could be said for things that could be solved with fists?It was peaceful for several days.The \u2018invisible buff\u2019 made the dog man not find her. Chu Yin was in a good mood as she focused on her studies until the day of the joint exam.Chu Yin met with the Song family\u2019s car outside the villa area.Song Zhaolin\u2019s head popped out of the window while he happily called out, \u201cSister Yin!\u201dChu Yin greeted him with a \u2018happy birthday\u2019 before handing him the gift. \u201cI can go there by myself. You don\u2019t have to offer me a ride.\u201d\u201cCome on, it\u2019s okay!\u201d Song Zhaolin happily opened the present while saying, \u201cCome on!\u201dChu Yin had no choice but to get in the car. As soon as she looked up, she saw a familiar face in the rearview mirror.\u201c?\u201dSong Zhaolin looked very proud today. His pick-up driver was his noble older brother?Song Yanchuan saw the surprise in the little girl\u2019s eyes, so he casually said, \u201cIt\u2019s only for today. He\u2019ll get a beating tomorrow.\u201dChu Yin laughed.Song Zhaolin: \u201cWhat! That\u2019s unfair!\u201dBecause Chu Yin had met Song Zhaolin\u2019s older brother before, it wasn\u2019t awkward to be in the same car. And with Song Zhaolin\u2019s jolly character, the atmosphere wasn\u2019t that cold.Chu Yin slightly adjusted her sitting position. At this moment, she caught a glimpse of Song Yanchuan\u2019s phone screen.The address of the XXXX nursing home was written on the navigation.Chu Yin\u2019s pupils dilated.A sense of familiarity came to her and she instantly realized where she had seen this nursing home.But why was it in Song Yanchuan\u2019s phone navigation?Chu Yin subconsciously looked away, making herself seem calm.Next to her, Song Zhaolin was playing with the present she gave him. Chu Yin\u2019s heart suddenly jumped twice.She remembered.That was the nursing home where Lu Zhen\u2019s mother Su Yumin lived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She only met his mother once.Chu Yin thought at that time that Lu Zhen would accompany her to meet his parents. But it was different \u2013 because the dog man made her stay in the ward alone with Su Yumin for half an hour.When he came back, he didn\u2019t even enter the room.Lu Zhen hugged her and asked in her ear when she walked out of the ward, \u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201d\u201cThe weather.\u201d Chu Yin was in a bad mood at that time.Lu Zhen lightly sighed.Chu Yin almost forgot this faint memory. She only remembered today.Why would Song Yanchuan have the address of this nursing home? He seemed to have nothing to do with them.Chu Yin thought of the conversation she heard outside the exam room that day \u2013 Could it be Lu Linyuan?What role did Lu Zhen\u2019s uncle play in this complicated relationship?An inexplicable sense of fate surged in her heart. Chu Yin realized that the world she lived in during her last life could be different from this life.While she was distracted, Song Yanchuan glanced in the rearview mirror for a split second before looking away.Little girl.\u2026Song Zhaolin invited a lot of people to his birthday party. He was the youngest member of the Song family. Although he often gets a beating, he was also spoiled since he was a child. The party was grand and lively.When Chu Yin came into the villa with the birthday star, most of the people\u2019s eyes went to her.The daughter of the Chu family, who was brought back from the countryside, grew up into an extremely beautiful lady. Because of the rumors of her being outstanding, many young people wanted to get to know her.But Chu Yin was in a trance.Song Zhaolin was very happy. All his friends were there.After socializing with them, he took a picture with his selfie stick.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s take a group photo~~\u201dA wealthy second-generation man who was next to Chu Yin lowered his head as he warmly reminded her, \u201cLook at the camera, beautiful.\u201dChu Yin then returned to her senses before slightly raising her chin.Song Zhaolin took several pictures then went to happily look at them. The wealthy second-generation who was next to Chu Yin wanted to communicate with her more, but Chu Yin declined.She changed to another location, thinking that she would leave after talking to Song Zhaolin.The other side.Lu Zhen just finished the meeting. He loosened his tie slightly.Lu Linyuan smiled and communicated with the directors. He agreed to have a drink together later.Although Lu Zhen was still the only absolute successor of the Lu family, Lu Linyuan could formally stand in front of the Lu group and take over part of Lu\u2019s industry as the son of Mr. Lu.The directors came over and invited Lu Zhen: \u201cYoung Master, will you be going with us?\u201dLu Linyuan smiled from behind and said, \u201cAh Zhen, you can drink now, right?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s face was flat as he nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dThe location they were going to was familiar. He had been here when he was a child.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t decline.But he was feeling very annoyed today.It\u2019s been a long time since he saw Chu Yin. It was as if he was covered by an evil spirit.Feeling that his irritation was taking over him, Lu Zhen stretched out his hand and loosened his tie again.At this moment, a WeChat message appeared on the phone.Song Zhaolin: [Brother Zhen, are you done? We\u2019re so happy~~]Song Zhaolin: [Come and play if you are done!! I\u2019ll reserve a cake for you!]Lu Zhen laughed while he opened the photo Song Zhaolin sent.Although the venue was very big and crowded, he saw Chu Yin at first sight.Sitting next to a strange man.That person was very close to her.Lu Zhen\u2019s fingertips suddenly became hot.rndd: [I will go over there now]\u201cDong Liu, Uncle Wang,\u201d Lu Zhen stopped and raised his head, \u201cUncle, I can\u2019t accompany you today.\u201dWhere does this young master want to go?Lu Linyuan teasingly smiled, \u201cIs there an urgent matter?\u201dLu Zhen paused for a second, then smiled: \u201cUm.\u201dUrgent matter.He left the Lu\u2019s building, got in the car, and went straight to the Song family. The car was stuck outside the villa area, so Lu Zhen pulled the door open and ran directly.Under the shining moon, a black-haired young man came running.You only live once.It\u2019s okay to come running to the girl you like.In the banquet hall, Chu Yin suddenly felt something.After talking to Song Zhaolin, she planned to quietly walk through the back door. But she instead looked at the script and knew that Lu Zhen was here.A certain sense of destiny entangled them again. Chu Yin panicked for no reason.She grabbed the pen and tried to change the script while walking towards the other side of the main entrance.The moment she touched the carved door handle, the door suddenly opened.The young man\u2019s heavy breathing came over. Chu Yin raised her eyes to meet Lu Zhen\u2019s hot gaze.\u201cDon\u2019t run.\u201dChu Yin was shocked \u2013 why was he running?!Lu Zhen felt the feeling that he hadn\u2019t seen her for a long time. Because of this, he wanted to confess right here and now.Chu Yin knew what he was going to do and suddenly stepped back.But Lu Zhen\u2019s raspy voice resounded, with little gaspings.\u2014\u201dSorry, I like you.\u201dThe restlessness of the evening night finally stopped.After a long time, Chu Yin slowly squeezed her fingers, her tone a bit fiercer: \u201cBut I don\u2019t like you.\u201dThat\u2019s what she said in her last life.At that time, Lu Zhen stood in front of her with red eyes, \u201cWhy?\u201dAnd this time, 17-year-old Lu Zhen also stood in front of her\u2026but was smiling.\u201cI see,\u201d he saidChu Yin was stunned.Lu Zhen\u2019s hand trembled a little. After a long pause, he lifted his hand and gently touched her head: \u201cI just want to tell you.\u201dWith that, he withdrew his hand: \u201cGood night, Chu Yin.\u201dThat night, no one knew that Lu Zhen had been there.He came with the warm wind but left silently like the moonlight.Chu Yin was again dumbfounded.The door of the Song family\u2019s house was opened. The deafening noise burst out. Chu Yin was wrapped by the sound wave, so she didn\u2019t hear it.\u2026\u2026Lu Zhen ran out with all his strength and also used up all his courage. He quietly laid in bed.Although he said good night, he didn\u2019t have a good dream.Lu Zhen had a long dream.Dreams of rain, flower skirt, cold classroom, and a cat.Everything that happened from the beginning was different from what was shown in this dream.Just like a memory.He didn\u2019t know whose perspective this memory was. He only knew that his heart was clenched tightly. The pain and suffocation were clinging to him excruciatingly.He didn\u2019t know how long his dream was when someone knocked on the door and forcibly interrupted his nightmare.\u201cAh Zhen? Ah Zhen! \u2014\u2014\u201dLu Zhen suddenly woke up and opened his tired eyes.Some of his dream fragments went away, turning it into a deep memory. Only the last sound of his dream reverberated in his ears.The voice was familiar, yet unfamiliar. It was chilling. It sounded like it was his\u2026.but was different.He asked the 17-year-old Lu Zhen in his ear, \u201cLu Zhen, do you like her?\u201d\u201cIf you want to make her happy.\u201d\u201cDie now.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was in a trance for a while after waking up.Then, a kind of inexplicable pain slowly spread in his heart.The voice, the appearance, and the aura were all familiar.It was strange, but he knew deep inside that it was\u2026him.Although it was different, Lu Zhen realized that the feelings he got from his dream were in line with himself.If he would face the same situation in his dreams, he would react in the same way \u2013 being uncontrollable and concerned.It was just like him.Humble and eager.But, why\u2014what had he actually experienced in his dream that it turned him into someone different?Lu Zhen slowly sat up from the bed. He lowered his eyes and forced himself to recall his dream.It was a very long dream. It felt real. It was as if it had happened before.In his perspective, the protagonist was\u2026Chu Yin.A completely different Chu Yin.She was bright and beautiful, different from the current Chu Yin he knew. The Chu Yin he knew was sensitive and stubborn. In this dream, he also liked Chu Yin and confessed to her. He was also rejected.But what about events after that? What happened?What was the ending of that story?His heart began to ache again. Lu Zhen frowned as he gently pressed down on his chest.After a while of silence, a voice came in again: \u201cAh Zhen, did you drink too much last night? Do you need hangover soup?\u201dLu Zhen regained his senses and found that his voice was hoarse: \u201c\u2026No need.\u201dHe got out of bed, opened the door of the room, and looked at Lu Linyuan\u2019s concerned face: \u201cUncle, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cThe servant said you didn\u2019t have any dinner last night, plus you woke up late today. I came to check on you.\u201d Lu Linyuan spread his hands, \u201cIt turns out that you were still asleep when I called. Is there anything wrong?\u201dLu Zhen waved his hand, suppressing all the emotions in his heart. His expression returned to normal as he said, \u201cI just slept too much.\u201dAside from his dream, he was rejected by the girl he liked.Lu Linyuan looked at his face and didn\u2019t see any fluctuations in his expression.\u201cI heard from the driver\u2026 You went to the Song\u2019s villa after leaving the company last night?\u201dLu Zhen quietly said, expressionlessly \u201cWell, it was Song Zhaolin\u2019s birthday.\u201dLu Linyuan laughed, \u201cHow close are you with the son of the Song family? You were acting so anxious yesterday.\u201dLu Zhen also smiled faintly: \u201cYes..just afraid I will be too late.\u201dAlthough he caught up with her, he felt like he was stabbed.Endured the torture all night.It was painfully cold.Lu Linyuan didn\u2019t say anything. He only smiled as he urged him to wash and eat. Lu Zhen nodded.There was no room in the Lu Family\u2019s mansion for Lu Linyuan. He only came over to see Lu Zhen. After checking up on him, he left to work on his affairs. Since he had now taken over part of the Lu Family\u2019s properties, he was busy every day.Lu Linyuan slowly walked out of the door. The assistant was already waiting for him in front of the car. He respectfully opened the door. Lu Linyuan got inside the car and made a call.The other end picked up quickly, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAh Zhen went to your place last night?\u201d Lu Linyuan asked with a smile, \u201cWhy not treat him well? You didn\u2019t give me face.\u201dSong Yanchuan sneered over the phone.Old fox, what are you pretending for?Who doesn\u2019t know who you are yet?Song Yanchuan\u2019s sympathy towards him was already used up when they were outside of the examination room, so now he didn\u2019t need to pretend. Between his partner and the friend of his silly brother, it was clear who was more important.\u201cYour nephew won\u2019t give me a chance.\u201d Song Yanchuan said calmly, \u201cWhen he arrived, he immediately met with the little girl. He left after speaking with her. How could I treat him? If I hadn\u2019t been drinking on the second floor, I wouldn\u2019t have known he was even here.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s eyebrows were raised. The corners of his lips deepened, \u201cOh? Who\u2019s this little girl that made Ah Zhen so anxious?\u201dSince he (LL) was pretending, Song Yanchuan also went with the flow, \u201cHow do I know? There are so many little girls in the house. Would I know every one of them? I\u2019m not that kind of a beast.\u201dLu Linyuan smiled: \u201cOkay, I understand. Have you finished what I told you to do last time?\u201dSong Yanchuan said, \u201cYeah\u201d.Then the conversation between the two ended.Lu Linyuan hung up the phone, and his smiling face was reflected on the dark cell phone screen.He had always been a well-behaved man. Even though he was in his thirties, he had the aura of a young man, not much different from Lu Zhen. At this moment, the elegant and handsome face was full of unspeakable pleasure.The assistant handed over the documents that needed to be signed. \u201cMr. Lu, you seem to be in a good mood.\u201dLu Linyuan snorted as he took the documents.Although Song Yanchuan didn\u2019t honestly tell him, he didn\u2019t need to think too much, he was completely sure.\u201cMy dear nephew has someone he likes. Of course, I am happy as an uncle.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s posture relaxed. He suddenly changed his mind and didn\u2019t want to go to the company.He said to the driver: \u201cTurn around. I want to see her.\u201dLu Linyuan didn\u2019t say any names, but anyone close to him knew who this \u201cher\u201d was.He smiled and leaned back in his chair.He quickly needed to tell her this great news.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t mention this to anyone and chose to uncover the meaning of his dream by himself.He, over and over again, tried to redream the ending of the story.But since that night, he hasn\u2019t had any of those dreams. There were only fragments of it that came back, which made it impossible to piece everything together.The only thing he was sure of in his dreams was that Chu Yin was always there.His heart pounded rapidly before he felt strongly suffocated.The pain seemed to follow him, tormenting every single nerve in his body.It was yet another morning that Lu Zhen woke up panting.He woke up chaotically last night, his heart was beating wildly. Lu Zhen\u2019s face was as pale as a paper.In the small fragment of a moment, he saw Chu Yin\u2019s tears.Her black eyes were like pebbles washed out by the water, with clear hatred written in them.Hate for him. He seemed to have angered her.Even in his dreams, Lu Zhen felt like he couldn\u2019t breathe.After waking up in a daze, he suddenly felt a strong desire to ask someone.Have you ever looked at me with such eyes?But just when the thought started, the young master who was pampered since birth, unexpectedly felt fear for the first time.According to his character, it didn\u2019t matter if he was rejected. He liked her so he could be shameless.However, now Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t dare to look for her, bother her, or disturb her.What if it was true, what if this happened in reality?\u2026Chu Yin discovered that since that day, Lu Zhen had been silent for a few days.It was the same as in her previous life. He was an arrogant young master. Although being rejected left a big impact on him, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t leave her life. He would just disappear and reappear now and then.Chu Yin had already adapted to his personality.Although she didn\u2019t know what Lu Zhen would do in this life, everything was different from before.If the dog man Lu Zhen would make trouble again, she could just use her golden finger! Since she had the right to modify the script, she wasn\u2019t afraid of him.In this life, she had the right to decide by herself. She wanted to study hard, get into a good university, and live a long and happy life.\u2014Study and learn!!!Who wouldn\u2019t let her learn?!Chu Yin stormed out of the car and walked to the campus.Unexpectedly, she would meet someone who would delay her study.Chu Yin met a rich second-generation yesterday at Song Zhaolin\u2019s party. She remembered that he introduced himself as Pei Ziyin.She (CY) was upset right now so she didn\u2019t respond to him. She also didn\u2019t expect that this young man would come to visit her at school??Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The rich second-generation student, with sunglasses on, stopped before Chu Yin.He tilted his head as he slowly took off his sunglasses, revealing a pair of sultry eyes.\u201cHi, beauty,\u201d Pei Ziyin said, \u201cYou took off so early that day, we weren\u2019t able to talk that much.\u201dHe was shocked by Chu Yin\u2019s beauty at the party. After asking Song Zhaolin, he decided to take the initiative.It was at this hour where the Huiwen students would walk through the gate. Because Chu Yin was a popular figure in the school, countless pairs of eyes stared at them.\u201cOmg, who dares to talk to my wife?!!\u201d\u201cAh! This scene doesn\u2019t look good!\u201d\u201cStay away from my sister!! Ah!\u201dPei Ziyin felt the stares around him too. In hindsight, he realized he was too conspicuous.But Chu Yin ended him with a single sentence: \u201cYou talk a lot, I\u2019m already bored.\u201dPei Ziyin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0Fuck, so ruthless.What kind of cold woman is this?!!Pei Ziyin was originally a little bit irritated, but as soon as he looked up at her face, his heartbeat quickly went lifeless.\u201c\u2026Oh, it seems that I am not interesting enough. Do you want to know more about me? I won\u2019t let you down.\u201d Pei Ziyin smiled.But Chu Yin was even more indifferent: \u201cNo. I have no hope for you, nor will I be disappointed.\u201dPei Ziyin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0Fuck, so cold.Chu Yin made her attitude clear in a few sentences, then turned and left. It was a bit late today, and it was annoying to be stopped by strange people and wasting time.As soon as she was gone, Pei Ziyin felt embarrassed.Some classmates around said loudly: \u201cHey, handsome guy, give up. You can\u2019t catch Chu Yin\u2019s heart.\u201dPei Ziyin wasn\u2019t convinced: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I get her?\u201d\u00a0He was excellent in all aspects.\u201cOur school has a lot of handsome students. A hundred times more handsome than you. Yet Chu Yin didn\u2019t respond to any of their advancements. Do you think you have any chance?\u201dPei Ziyin was so excited by this challenge that he was elated.\u201cHow many handsome students are there? I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re better than me! You wait.\u201dAfter speaking, he slammed the door of the sports car and drove away.The classmates looked at him, shook their heads, and sighed: \u201cNot counting the number, do you think you\u2019re better than Lu Zhen?\u201dChu Yin entered the class, Song Zhaolin immediately grabbed her and screamed as he gently pushed her.After having celebrated his birthday, Song Zhaolin was now undergoing another round of mournful state.His brother didn\u2019t lie to him. The preferential treatment was only limited to his birthday. It was gone after that.Song Zhaolin cried, \u201cMy brother said that if I can\u2019t get into the top five in the class this time, he would give me a big gift.Chu Yin had already taken out the textbooks she needed for class, and asked casually, \u201cWhat kind of gift?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cLeft and right uppercuts, leg whip \u2013 high and low, as well as a set of stick beatings.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhat a wonderful gift!Song Zhaolin: \u201cAhhhh I\u2019m only 17 years old. I can\u2019t be beaten, and being beaten will make me stupid!\u201dChu Yin also felt worried: \u201cIndeed, it\u2019s not good to be stupid.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026\u201dSince he was triggered by Chu Yin\u2019s honesty, he carefully listened during his several classes that day.The mid-term exam was next week. The study tasks in the tutoring classes were getting more serious. After Chu Yin\u2019s cold rejection that day, no one dared to be the next victim.Han Chuying invited Chu Yin to investigate their enemy\u2019s battleground for the joint exam.After finishing the papers, as usual, Han Chuying suddenly said loudly \u201cAhh!\u201d\u201cIs this school crazy?\u201dChu Yin asked her question without raising her head, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the student who won the gold medal in the international mathematics competition. I didn\u2019t expect him to be so arrogant.\u201d Han Chuying glared at the phone. \u201cHe said that there are not many students who are good at mathematics in our city. He also said that our school won two medals in the Hope Cup this year because\u2026guess what?!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cBecause\u2026he didn\u2019t participate? That made Huiwen win the prize?\u201dHan Chuying was stunned, \u201cHow do you know!\u201dChu Yin smiled, \u201cThis person\u2019s thinking is easy to guess.\u201dWhen Han Chuying thought about it, she became angry. Her YinYin goddess is so powerful! How awesome is she!!!\u201cHe also said girls are not good at math by nature. There are only a few of them who are good at math in the liberal arts department. No one in our city could beat them.\u201dDoes sexism still exist? Plus targeting the whole city?Chu Yin also felt that this person was sick in the head.This kind of mentally ill thought that downgrades people was irritating.Her eyes slightly raised as she squeezed the pen in her hand. Only when she had this kind of opponent could her fighting spirit be aroused.Let\u2019s take the joint exam immediately and compete on the same stage. Everyone will know when that time comes\u2026When Chu Yin finished reviewing the lectures, the students in the classroom were all gone.She stretched silently.At this moment, a faint noise came from the back door of the classroom. She followed the sound and saw only the corner of the person\u2019s clothes outside the glass of the backdoor.Chu Yin was startled.Although she didn\u2019t see it, she somehow knew who it was.Lu Zhen?He silently watched her, but when he got found out, he left in a panic. This kind of behavior\u2026was not like him.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know why he was acting like this. This made her lost in her thoughts for a while.She thought that Lu Zhen would still be the same as in her previous life \u2013 pestering her until she gave up. If he acted like that again, she would use her golden finger to make him give up first.But Lu Zhen didn\u2019t. He chose to be a little courteous and timid.She didn\u2019t know what happened, but that night, she had a dream.She dreamt about something from her previous life.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t hear the alarm the next day. After waking up, she realized that she was almost late for school, so she hurriedly took a piece of bread before rushing to the car.She leaned back in the chair, closed her eyes, and tried to remember the dream last night in her mind.\u2026At the sports event late autumn last year, she was bullied by a group of people who didn\u2019t like her. She was splashed with ice water and locked in the classroom.Because it had been many years later, she forgot about these little details. But now she remembered in her dream that she cried that time.Sitting in the corner with wet knees, two drops of tears fell from her eyes. She wiped them severely.When the proud, but ignorant little girl was taken back from the countryside, she stood out for being oddly different in the world of wealthy people. Even if she lived humbly, all she received was malice and sarcasm. Even though Chu Yin didn\u2019t care much about it, did this make her feel inferior in her heart?Chu Yin didn\u2019t stay in the classroom for too long.The little afterglow that shined through the window cracks covered the classroom. When she was shivering due to the cold air, the door lock opened with a click.The door loudly banged. Lu Zhen stood outside the door, with obvious anger showing in his grim face, as he lightly gasped.Chu Yin changed her posture as soon as she saw him \u2013 from her weak posture of tucking her knee to a daring cross-legged sitting position.\u201cYeah,\u201d she laughed, \u201cAren\u2019t you amazing? To be able to find me even here.\u201d\u2019Lu Zhen\u2019s dark pupils fell on her Chu Yin\u2019s pale face.He strode in while taking off his coat.The corners of Chu Yin\u2019s lips tightened as she stepped back: \u201cI don\u2019t want your clothes\u2013\u201cShe didn\u2019t show any weakness. She didn\u2019t need anyone to protect her.But Lu Zhen had already walked up to her, squatted down, and wrapped his coat tightly around her.Maybe it was because Chu Yin felt cold at that time. In her dream, she suddenly remembered the temperature on her body at that time.Very hot.Then Lu Zhen grabbed her arm and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I\u2019m not going.\u201dHer hair was wet and messy. She didn\u2019t want to be seen at all.And she didn\u2019t want people to see her wrapped in his clothes. If she was seen, she would be bullied again by those people.Lu Zhen lowered his head and took a breath to calm himself down. When he finally looked up, his tone was still a bit fierce.\u2014\u201dWho the hell did it?\u201dChu Yin was stunned.Lu Zhen wasn\u2019t playing around. Chu Yin couldn\u2019t sit up by herself so he (LZ) stretched out his hand for her to take.Chu Yin got up from the ground, unexpectedly showing a trace of confusion.Lu Zhen\u2019s voice was a little lower now. He lifted the hairs on her wet forehead, wrapped the coat tightly, and whispered to her, \u201cFollow me?\u201dChu Yin still didn\u2019t move.\u201cChu Yin,\u201d Lu Zhen lowered his eyes to look at her, \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s afraid? I\u2019m not afraid,\u201d Chu Yin caught a cold from the freezing water. She said while sounding a little nasally, \u201cThey\u2019re only afraid of you.\u201dThe 17-year-old girl raised her eyes. Even if she was in a mess, it was as bright as a star.Lu Zhen looked at her deeply for a long time. He lowered his head and cursed. His tone was a little raspy, \u201cThen what the hell do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s protection, especially from you, Lu Zhen \u2013\u00a0someday\u00a0I will become strong enough. Do you believe it or not?\u201dOne day.Chu Yin, who was leaning on the back of the car\u2019s backseat, suddenly opened her eyes.At that time, she had no confidence. She could only boast by saying the phrase \u2018someday\u2019. It took a lifetime for it to come true.At the end of the dream, the reckless teenager had become a paranoid man.He repeated it over and over again in her ear, like a mad man: \u201cDon\u2019t go, don\u2019t leave\u2026\u201dHis voice was hoarse. For a moment, she couldn\u2019t distinguish who was more desperate, the person who heard it or the person who said it.\u2014Chu Yin chose to not remember anymore.The later the memories, the more unbearable they become.Who could have imagined that the enthusiastic teenager would eventually become a murderer of her freedom?Chu Yin lowered her long eyelashes.Everything in this life was different. Lu Zhen was also different from her last life.But she knew. It was not Lu Zhen that had changed, but her.And she had to make a difference.Even if Lu Zhen\u2019s behavior changed, she shouldn\u2019t be shaken.Since the dog man didn\u2019t come to disturb her, Chu Yin was able to study in peace. She didn\u2019t think about other things for a few days.If life goes on like this, it seems pretty good.Unfortunately, after school that day, Pei Ziyin appeared at the school gate again. Chu Yin knew that this world was still that world, and there would always be strange people appearing.Pei Ziyin changed the sports car he was riding every time he visited Chu Yin \u2013 in a sorrowful attempt to show off that he was excellent in all aspects.Chu Yin carried her school bag and sighed.\u00a0I really want to hit someone.As Lu Zhen followed from behind, walking out of the school building, he saw this scene.Chu Yin\u2019s fair face was tense. Standing in the gentle afterglow of the setting sun, the boy in front of her shook his head.Lu Zhen could tell at a glance that the person standing in front of her was the person in the photo that day.At that time he was sitting very closely next to Chu Yin.Lu Zhen\u2019s pupils slowly darkened.A kind of restlessness suddenly rose from his heart, bringing out extreme anger in his dark eyes.The pain he felt that night was different from this.No one knew the moment they shared that time. It was a secret connection between him and her. Even the pain he felt was something they shared.He didn\u2019t care if she thought of him as despicable.Even if she didn\u2019t like him.Chu Yin\u2019s dislike for him should only be for him. It shouldn\u2019t be shared with anyone else.\u2026Chu Yin was frustrated with Pei Ziyin because of his persistent actions.\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything to you. I just want to study.\u201dPei Ziyin: \u201cWhat are the qualities that I have that you\u2019re dissatisfied with? Your classmate said that there are many students in this school that are better than me. In what aspect? I\u2013\u201dHe hadn\u2019t finished his sentence when he was suddenly grabbed by the collar and pulled back.Pei Ziyin let out a \u2018What the fuck\u2019 before being slammed away. When he turned around to curse, \u201cYou motherfucker\u2013\u201dHe was faced with Lu Zhen\u2019s stare.Pei Ziyin\u2019s voice suddenly choked in his throat\u2014Lu Zhen?!He can yell at anyone except Lu Zhen. The livelihood of the Pei family depends on the Lu family.Pei Ziyin\u2019s voice awkwardly turned a corner as he gave a dry smile, \u201cThis\u2026brother Zhen? Is there something I can do for you?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s icy voice sounded: \u201cSomething..\u201dPei Ziyin looked stupid in front of Lu Zhen. He felt chills from his back, thinking how he offended him.But under Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze, he dared not say a word. He jumped into his sports car and drove away.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin also wanted to leave.After she refused Lu Zhen\u2019s confession, this was the first time they faced each other.The young man\u2019s expression was a little dazed. He didn\u2019t seem to have slept well recently.After being stared at by Chu Yin, Lu Zhen\u2019s heart became uncontrollable again.Fragmented dreams and reality were intertwined. His nerves felt like it was being cut by a knife. Although his brain was hurting, he forced himself to smile, \u201cSorry.\u201dJealousy is ugly. But he couldn\u2019t hold it back.Chu Yin frowned as she looked at him.She didn\u2019t know why, but she vaguely felt that there was something wrong with Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart began to curl up. His fingertips slightly trembled.He wanted to confirm something.\u201cChu Yin.\u201d Lu Zhen whispered her name. He then raised his arm and spread his palm.The two candies in his hand reflected under the setting sun.One strawberry flavor, one coconut flavor.In their \u2018reality\u2019, he didn\u2019t know Chu Yin\u2019s preferences.But in the \u2018fragments\u2019 of his dreams, he knew that Chu Yin liked things with coconut flavor.Lu Zhen badly wanted to know.If those memories were true.If his pain and regret were real.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t figure out his intentions. Her delicate eyebrows frowned, \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201dLu Zhen tightly covered his crazy and repressed emotions. His lips curled, \u201cNot in the options.\u201dThere was no need to pretend now. He had already confessed his deepest thought.Chu Yin was annoyed: \u201cLu Zhen, are you shameless?!\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Lu Zhen laughed. His voice trembled uncontrollably, \u201cStrawberry or coconut? Pick one before you go.\u201dJust one.Chu Yin glared at him, slapping the other hand to take the candy.\u201cOkay now?\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes and looked at the strawberry candy flavor left in his palm.His eyes burned red, slowly clenching the candy.\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was even more eye-catching when Chu Yin rejected him in front of so many eyes. Who knew that this group of melon-eating people would witness another explosive character on the scene?The scene where the rich second-generation young man jumped in the car and drove away after Lu Zhen talked to him. This was seen by many people.There would soon be another viral post in the forum.\u3010Ahh! This almost shocked me to death!!\u3011Main Thread: My husband and wife SZD\u00a01. I declare Chu x Gu\u00a02\u00a0and all other cp\u00a03\u00a0to end!The photos were taken casually. Because of the two people\u2019s exquisite appearances, it gave a youthful-campus feel.Hao Diao found this post and immediately cried while yelling, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I have both of them? This is too wrongful!\u201dBut soon, different opinions appeared from this post.Anonymous 23: Are you blind? Can\u2019t you see the beautiful appearances of our Sister Yin and Brother Zhen??Anonymous 24: Are these two people\u00a04\u00a0arguing??Attached underneath the post was a photo of a girl reaching out to take the candy from the boy. It was supposed to be a sweet and delicate picture if not for Chu Yin\u2019s frowning face as she stared at Lu Zhen fiercely.Lu Zhen showed a grim expression. They didn\u2019t know why, but it gave them a sad impression. Why was Lu Zhen sad?Anonymous 35: My brain automatically created a sadistic love story between them!Anonymous 36: @35, I have a friend who wants to read the story you created!Anonymous 37: I\u2019m that friend!!!\u2026\u2026Anonymous 40: Are all the people in this thread stupid? Using this situation to write a FanFic story?After this comment was posted, someone fired something back, and somebody else counterattacked. During this heated debate, a student commented, \u201cWhy do I feel that Brother Zhen was rejected in this picture\u2026\u201dIt was unfortunate that no one noticed this comment because of the ongoing replies from this thread, except Song Zhaolin, who had good eyes.He touched his chin and thought deeply: \u201cThis classmate is amazing.\u201dSong Zhaolin felt that he might have discovered a forbidden secret!After all, he felt that Brother Zhen was recently in a bad state. Song Zhaolin guessed that it was probably because he was rejected by the indifferent and heartless beauty! This rejection resulted in him losing his soul??Song Zhaolin sighed sadly. But at the same time, he wanted to gloat. He didn\u2019t expect that his Brother Zhen would soon have this kind of day!Song Zhaolin was lying on the sofa, holding the tablet. It didn\u2019t take long before he heard the door of the house open.He sat up with his back straight and skilfully switched the tablet\u2019s screen to an online class video.After Song Yanchuan came in, he only glanced at him.Song Zhaolin dodged a disaster. He looked at his brother and smiled flatteringly: \u201cBrother, why are you back so late?\u201dSong Yanchuan: \u201cBusy.\u201dSong Zhaolin thought for a while, and found that he seemed to be busy recently: \u201cDo you have to finish so many tasks in the company? To the point that you work overtime everyday?\u201d\u00a0 He remembered that his brother\u2019s workload wasn\u2019t this heavy before!Song Yanchuan glanced at him: \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault that you can\u2019t live up to expectations.\u201dSong Zhaolin aggrievedly cried: Why attack me again?!Song Yanchuan ignored him and walked out of the room.The Song family\u2019s properties were not that big. But, Song Yanchuan needed to do much more than protecting his family\u2019s properties because every member depended on him.What\u2019s more, his idiot brother only knew how to play every day. He didn\u2019t study at all.Who the hell would want to work with an old pervert\u00a05\u00a0if it wasn\u2019t for this idiot brother that he needed to pave the way for?It was from Han Chuying that Chu Yin learned about the forum post of the \u2018quarrel\u2019 between her and Lu Zhen.After clicking the link, the desire to survive consumed her.Are these people ghosts?!Reading this any longer would probably give her a heart attack. Chu Yin immediately threw the phone aside.She then hugged her arms, sat at the desk, and began to ponder.There\u2019s something wrong. Even if there was something wrong with the dog man, she couldn\u2019t pinpoint exactly what the problem was given the information from the script.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t figure out anything so she asked the system: \u201cDo you think there\u2019s something wrong?\u201dXueji said: \u201cAccording to the monitoring system, there was a small-range energy fluctuation a few days ago.\u201dChu Yin was startled: \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you say it earlier?\u201dXueji innocently said: \u201cThe system made a prompt sound.\u201dChu Yin was so angry that she wanted to beat him. \u201cI didn\u2019t hear it!!\u201dXueji: (^.<)\u201cWhen did this happen exactly? What caused the manifestation? Is this related to the male lead?\u201dXueji: \u201cSince this has already happened, the system can\u2019t provide a search function. The cause of the manifestation is beyond the system\u2019s ability. The host needs to explore it by herself.\u201d\u2026and then came a long list of nonsense that the system rambled.Chu Yin touched her temples with her two fingers to calm herself, \u201cWhat am I going to do with you?\u201dXueji: \u201cT.T.\u201d\u00a06Maybe the changes in the dog man\u2019s body were related to this matter? If it was a few days ago, the biggest provoking event would be the confession.Did something happen that day that she didn\u2019t know about?Chu Yin bit her nails anxiously.A sense of security then saved her from anxiety when she remembered she still had the authority to change a paragraph in her account.Why was she afraid? She was a woman who could control the weather. If anything happened, she could just change it! With the paragraph in her hands, whoever wanted to mess with her could bring it on!In this world of fiction, all of these characters couldn\u2019t escape from the script.After calming down, a stronger desire to study emerged.What was more important than learning? Nothing! Study everything!Study to learn to learn to fight!\u2026Han Chuying joined a mathematics collaboration group before. Because a lot of information and strange topics were shared, she knew that Chu Yin would like it, so she invited her.The collaboration group required every member to change their name to a format of [school-grade-name], which Chu Yin complied to.Unexpectedly, one day later, one of the top students in mathematics in the nearby city that Han Chuying mentioned also joined.Han Chuying was afraid that Chu Yin would feel annoyed, so she suggested in a low voice, \u201cYin Yin, why don\u2019t we leave? So that our moods won\u2019t get affected if he says something.\u201dChu Yin felt indifferent: \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can just be civilized monkey watchers.\u00a07This \u2018monkey\u2019 would soon act as they expected.[No. 1 Middle School \u2013 Sophomore Liberal Arts \u2013 Chang Jinggeng]: Why are there only girls in this group??As soon as he posted this message, the original lively group chat suddenly went cold.Chang Jinggeng was indeed very famous in this city. He was a top student from junior high school to high school.He was the city\u2019s champion in the high school entrance examination that year, and he was admitted to the special training class of the first high school with high scores.Later, he chose liberal arts because of his excellent academic performance, but he was better at math than science. This resulted in him looking down on the students from his department.The group was silent and cold for a while before some girls continued the discussion from earlier, but Chang Jinggeng sent another message.[No. 1 Middle School \u2013 Sophomore Liberal Arts \u2013 Chang Jinggeng]: Are there any other math gurus here? Please speak out!Han Chuying whispered \u201cfuck\u201d in the self-study class.What\u2019s wrong with this man?![Wen Wen \u2013 Sophomore Liberal Arts \u2013 Han Chuying]: Can girls not be math gurus?A few girls agreed.But Chang Jinggeng ignored them and sent another message: I heard that there\u2019s a male student in Huiewen that won the Hope Cup? Is he in this group? If not, then I\u2019m leaving.His attitude caused the group to completely explode.Han Chuying almost wanted to scold him: The male student only got the silver medal, OK? The one who got the gold medal is a girl.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chang Jinggeng had been thinking like this since childhood. The education he received when he was young didn\u2019t correct his wrong beliefs.Han Chuying\u2019s hands were shaking. And every word she uttered was spoken angrily: Is it difficult to admit that girls are good?! Is your brain sick?![Chang Jinggeng]: Why are you so defensive? Was it you who got the gold medal?Han Chuying was so angry that she lifted the table.Chu Yin noticed her mood swings. She took a piece of paper, picked up her phone, and looked at it.After Chang Jinggeng sent the message, he completely angered the girls in various schools. He was scolded for many hours.Chu Yin thought that he had stopped, and was too lazy to pay attention to him. Just as she wanted to put away her phone, a new message popped up.[Chang Jinggeng]: @[Huiwen \u2013 Liberal Arts sophomore \u2013 Han Chuying] I thought you were good. You didn\u2019t even make it to the Hope Cup Finals? I specifically checked the total score of this winter camp for you. Han Chuying is 12th. Aren\u2019t you embarrassed to be ranting here?After reading these messages, Chu Yin\u2019s calm mood finally fluctuated.Who was this extinct idiot?After Chang Jinggeng sent these messages, no one argued anymore, so he smiled triumphantly.\u00a0Sure enough, the quickest and most effective way is to talk about people\u2019s grades. These girls don\u2019t get very good grades. They only have high morale.[Chang Jinggeng]: This is the quality of Huiwen\u2019s students.After posting, he was in a good mood and wanted to turn off his phone to study.At this moment, a new message popped up suddenly.[Huiwen \u2013 Sophomore Liberal Arts \u2013 Chu Yin]: Do you want to make a bet? If you lose, you apologize.As soon as she showed up, all of the Huiwen students who were silent in the group exploded.[Fuck. Sister Yin is also in this group?!?!][Ooo ah ah sister is speaking up!]Chang Jinggeng looked at the audacious girl and frowned \u2014 the name Chu Yin was a little familiar.[Stupid! The gold medalist is here. I don\u2019t understand those men who want to pretend they\u2019re all good.]Chang Jinggeng just remembered that when looking at the total results of the winter camp just now, this name was in the first place.[No. 1 Middle School \u2013 Sophomore Liberal Arts \u2013 Chang Jinggeng]: Your grades are quite good, I didn\u2019t scold you.Chu Yin smiled coldly at the phone: [Whoever scores high in the math entrance exam wins. The loser should wipe the other school\u2019s door. Do you accept this challenge?]This time not only the Huiwen students in the group, but also people from other schools fainted by her handsomeness.[This elder sister is so sassy! Ah!][Ahh!! I\u2019m so excited!]\u2026This incident quickly spread back to the Huiwen school. Ahhh!!!Because there were at least seven or eight students from the school in the group chat, the cause and result of the incident were all reported and screenshots of Chu Yin\u2019s chat records in the group were all widely spread.[picture] [picture] [picture][picture] [picture] [picture][This sister is seeking justice for Huiwen!][Can she do this alone?]The two schools\u2019 top students openly started a war, which immediately put the school\u2019s honor on the line. This event made everyone extremely enthusiastic.\u2026Chu Yin didn\u2019t challenge him on a whim.After hearing about the award Chang Jinggeng had won, Chu Yin collected many examination questions over the years and had practiced long before. She was certain about Chang Jinggeng\u2019s general level.Moreover, even if there was no bet involved, getting first place in the joint exam was required by the system.So, Chu Yin used this idiot to add fire to himself. He must try his best to do well in the exam this time.This time, Lu Zhen did not become her rival again.From that day on, he put the remaining strawberry candy in his pocket and decided to do one thing.\u2026Dream.Even if he was vaguely aware that the end of the dream was a terrible black hole, he wanted to come closer and see clearly.Everything about Chu Yin.Everything that was real.In order to make the dream longer and more stable, Lu Zhen even took medicine.Before going to bed this time, he once again sorted out the dream fragments, then raised his neck and swallowed the pills blankly.He had a feeling that this night, the dream would come again. He just had to wait.The bottles of medicine bottles were scattered on the bedside in a dimly lit room. Lu Zhen laid in the heavy silk quilt as time reversed from day to night and night to day.The servant, with a breakfast plate on hand, knocked on the door for a long time, receiving no response.\u201cForget it, go down.\u201d Lu Linyuan waved his hand.Lu Zhen\u2019s abnormality even alarmed the old man. But apart from the longer sleeping time, there was nothing abnormal on his face, and he was not sick.Lu Linyuan looked at Lu Zhen\u2019s door for a while, then turned and left, his lips curling slightly.Since he can\u2019t find the reason here, there\u2019s another way to find it.Lu Zhen is so abnormal\u2026Could the reason be as he expected? Lu Linyuan thought with some pleasure.\u2026The day before the midterm exam, Chu Yin steadily finished the planned papers in school, then packed her bag and left.The weather gradually became hot as it entered the season of May. But this day\u2019s climate was gloomy and cloudy. It was about to rain.Chu Yin left the school gate and was walking in the direction of her family\u2019s car when suddenly she heard a voice from nearby.\u201cClassmate Chu?\u201dChu Yin looked over and saw Lu Linyuan.\u201cUncle Lu.\u201d She said hello.Lu Linyuan walked over with a surprised look and a gentle and easy-going smile: \u201cWhy are you still at school so late? I just passed by here and saw you at a glance.\u201d\u201cYes. I was answering math problems.\u201d Chu Yin also smiled.Originally, she had a good impression of Lu Linyuan, and it was hard not to act kindly on this handsome uncle.But\u2026 Ever since being reminded by Song Yanchuan, and then seeing the address of the nursing home in his car, Chu Yin was now more wary of Lu Linyuan.Just in case, she knocked on the system and unlocked the script.Lu Linyuan smiled mildly as he carefully looked at Chu Yin, his expression not giving any hints: \u201cSo hardworking? I didn\u2019t have the chance to meet you a few times before. And since I just happened to meet today, how about we..\u201dAt this moment, the script loaded. It was clear from this line of words:\u3010Lu Linyuan deliberately asked the driver to drive outside the Huiwen school, and deliberately ran into Chu Yin.\u3011Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dShe suddenly had the movie of a serial killer playing through her mind.This goldfinger is too strong\u2026The bad guys are easy to distinguish.Although Lu Linyuan hadn\u2019t done anything so far, Chu Yin at least knew that he was not as harmless as he appeared to be.Chu Yin pondered for a while and cut a word on the script.Lu Linyuan was still smiling slightly as he was a very friendly person. He hardly ever failed to win over any girls.\u201cHow? I just want to talk to you about Lu Zhen, I have been worried about him recently.\u201dOh.It\u2019s none of my business!!Lu Linyuan was acutely aware of her hesitation and said, \u201cAre you rushing home to study? Just sit down for a while. I won\u2019t delay you.\u201dChu Yin finally said, \u201cNot right now.\u201dLu Linyuan was very patient. With a smile, he said: \u201cWhy is it inappropriate? Don\u2019t think of me as an elder. Ah Zhen and I treat each other like friends\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Chu Yin interrupted him.Then she raised her hand and pointed to a place not far behind Lu Linyuan, her voice calm.\u2014 \u201cYour car is on fire.\u201dIn the distance, that seven-figure luxury car.\u2026was puffing with white smoke.Lu Linyuan: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Once she agreed, they could go to the high-end western restaurant in front.\u3011Chu Yin didn\u2019t like how the script was going so she changed \u2018parked\u2019 to \u2018burned\u2019In fact, \u2018explosion\u2019 was fine but the risk factor was too high. It was too eye-catching.After Lu Linyuan gracefully invited the girl to get in his car for dinner, he saw his car in flames just when he turned around.Haha:) How interesting.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want anything to do with him, so she chose the most convenient and effective way.Lu Linyuan was probably also dumbfounded. Needless to say, his car\u2019s performance was top-notch. For his safety considerations, he had always heavily maintained it.How could it catch on fire?The driver and the special assistant also looked dumbfounded. They hurriedly called someone to deal with it.Lu Linyuan quickly recovered his shock as he showed a slightly helpless smile: \u201cWhat should I do? My car became like this.\u201dIf she didn\u2019t know his real identity, she would probably be fooled by his face, his expression, and his way of speaking.But now, Chu Yin just wanted to shout: Fake! Roll!She looked at the distance and then smiled politely: \u201cMy family\u2019s car is here. I have a midterm exam tomorrow so I have to go home to review. Goodbye.\u201dIf Lu Linyuan invited her again, it would seem too deliberate. He nodded in good faith, and smiled: \u201cEat well and don\u2019t be too tired.\u201dChu Yin smiled without answering, turned to her family\u2019s car, and drove away.Lu Linyuan waved his hand regretfully as he watched the car leave.The special assistant walked behind him and bowed slightly: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, Mr. Lu. The cause of the car\u2019s breakdown is still being investigated. Please wait for a while. The driver is already on the way.\u201dLu Linyuan gave a response, and suddenly asked, \u201cWhen was the last inspection?\u201dThe special assistant: \u201cTwo weeks ago.\u201dLu Linyuan raised his eyebrows slightly, and waved his hand: \u201cGo and check.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLu Linyuan originally thought that the outstanding advantage of this little girl named Chu Yin was that she was only beautiful \u2013 well, looking at her closely, she was exquisite.But for a brief period, he found her very interesting.The little girl was completely unmoved by him.The corners of Lu Linyuan\u2019s lips curled up slightly. It seemed that he could not regard her as \u2018just an ordinary little girl.\u2026On the way home, Chu Yin pondered about Lu Linyuan.She vaguely felt that Lu Linyuan\u2019s participation in the plot was deeper than she imagined. His relationship with Lu Zhen\u2019s mother, as well as his relationship with Lu Zhen, had many details that she hadn\u2019t paid attention to in her previous life.Why was Lu Linyuan coming to her? What was his purpose?Could it be to help Lu Zhen\u2026But Chu Yin shook her head again. Based on her understanding of this dog man, he would not even mention things like chasing\u00a01\u00a0people with others, let alone ask others for help.But anyway, if the uncle and nephew dared to do something, she would be a shark!2That night, Chu Yin\u2019s study rhythm wasn\u2019t distracted at all by Lu Linyuan\u2019s presence. After all, the most important thing for her right now was the exam. She also made a bet with Chang Jinggeng.She wasn\u2019t passionate nor cared about the school\u2019s honor. Her original intention of betting was only because Chang Jinggeng was too stupid. She was disgusted by his insulting actions against Han Chuying.If she would win first place in this joint exam, she would be awarded a single sentence authority.Xueji was a bit stingy. And this just showed two things: 1) Her learning ability and the system\u2019s evaluation of her was increasing as the day went by. 2) Getting first place wouldn\u2019t be difficult, otherwise, the reward would be greater than a single sentence authority.Xue Ji watched Chu Yin\u2019s reverse thinking. It had to say that this host was sharp and smart.Because she was steadily studying, she didn\u2019t need to cram before the exam. Chu Yin conscientiously recited her core notes, picked up a set of math papers, and then went to bed early.She was very confident in herself.The city\u2019s joint exam was the next day. The competition between Huiwen and the No.1 Middle School involved both schools\u2019 honor.Students from the No.1 Middle School were still actively discussing this morning:[Chu Yin from the other school impressed me. She was also the beautiful little sister in the speech contest.][Really? Then she might beat God Geng\u00a03][@ChangJinggeng, God Geng, how sure are you that you\u2019ll win this bet?]Chang Jinggeng: [You can bet that I\u2019ll win. Relax.][He is worthy of being the God Geng][No.1 middle school rises majestically!]The teachers of Huiwen found that the learning momentum of the students was particularly good. They didn\u2019t know what caused this.In the past few days, the cyberwar between the two schools had entered a fierce stage. They were both browsing the school forums of both sides. From time to time, there would be quarreling and some shouting in the air.For so many years, there were only these kinds of exchanges between Huiwen and No.1 Middle School. The bet between Chu Yin and Chang Jinggeng was the focus of everyone\u2019s attention.At the last review time, Class 5 quietly studied their exercise book\u2014even Song Zhaolin was busy.Chu Yin was amused by his rare spirit of learning. After the early self-study, she asked him: \u201cAre you so afraid of your brother\u2019s combo punches?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Song Zhaolin\u2019s eyes reluctantly tore from his book and said, \u201cBut it\u2019s not only because I\u2019d get beaten! This is the battle of honor! You have an ongoing bet with the fool from No.1 Middle School. As your favorite deskmate, how can I not do my best!\u201dChu Yin applauded: \u201cI\u2019m moved with so many tears.\u201dSong Zhaolin pointed out: \u201cI don\u2019t see a single tear!!\u201dChu Yin smiled, packed her bag, and was ready to go to the examination room.Song Zhaolin also packed up his things and sighed loudly: \u201cI am finally in the same examination room as Brother Zhen this time. What a pity!\u00a04\u201dAt the end of the semester, Lu Zhen only took two subjects. Although he placed first in Math, his overall score was subjected to the same examination room as Song Zhaolin.\u201cI was thinking of relying on him for Math. It\u2019s a pity that Brother Zhen didn\u2019t even come to take the exam.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dThinking about it, she hadn\u2019t seen the dog man for several days. No wonder it was peaceful.She didn\u2019t ask, but Song Zhaolin continued talking, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with Brother Zhen lately. He seems to be in a very bad condition. He has been sleeping a lot at home. What if he\u2019s sick\u2026\u201dSleeping?Chu Yin frowned slightly. She couldn\u2019t think of a reason.Walking out of the classroom and into the examination room, she met many other students in the corridor.When they saw Chu Yin, they cheered her on one after another: \u201cSister Yin, don\u2019t stress! Relax!\u201d\u201cBelieve in yourself, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d\u201cYou are already in our hearts!\u201dThe students didn\u2019t believe she could defeat the famous top student in the No.1 Middle School. Their attitude was entirely encouraging.After entering the first examination room, most of the people sitting were classmates in the tutoring class. Everyone was familiar with each other.\u201cClass leader, do your best!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re rooting for you!\u201dChu Yin was helpless and let them roar for a while, then clapped her hands: \u201cQuiet.\u201dThe whole class was immediately quiet within three seconds.The prestige of the class leader was evident.Anyone in the examination room who did not enter the remedial class was shocked at the sight of this posture.Sister Chu is too handsome, QAQ!!We also want to be supervised by her aaahh!The examination style of the city\u2019s joint examination room was different from the usual style of Huiwen. The difficulty was great.Chu Yin sat in the first seat and answered it carefully.After the language test, Jiang Yan and Han Chuying immediately came over and asked her nervously, \u201cYin Yin, how was it?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s about the same difficulty as I expected.\u201dHan Chuying was immediately relieved: \u201cStay relaxed. Relax!\u201dChu Yin laughed, \u201cI haven\u2019t taken the Math exam yet.\u201dMathematics was the key point.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After reading for a while, Chu Yin suddenly remembered an academic point she hadn\u2019t understood yet, so she got up and went to the teacher\u2019s office.Sister Wang was away, there was only one math teacher in the office, and Chu Yin had never dealt with her.After hesitating for a few seconds, she walked over. There was already a classmate with a question, and Chu Yin stood behind her and waited quietly.But the teacher and the student stopped. One looked back, the other looked up, and they blinked as they looked at her.Chu Yin was a little embarrassed to be stared at. She touched the tip of her nose and explained, \u201cI have a question about this exercise\u2026may I?\u201dIf the teacher wasn\u2019t available, she could ask Gu Qiuze since she just saw him.Unexpectedly, the teacher and the student immediately said: \u201cNo problem!\u201dThe enthusiasm was a bit scary.Chu Yin quickly pressed the classmate: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, you ask your question first.\u201d\u201cNo, no, no!\u201d The classmate severely shook her head, \u201cClassmate Chu Yin, you can come here\u2013\u201dShe was just a small cookie! Can she win the honor of the school like Chu Yin? She can\u2019t! Who in the school didn\u2019t know about Chu Yin and her bet? If sister lost, she had to clean the school door of No.1 Middle School! She won\u2019t allow it to happen!Chu Yin had no idea that she had become the object of protection for the whole school.Someone had said that Chu Yin was the person with the most positive changes in the school. In the beginning, she was only an ordinary student and later became a beautiful top student. Now, she was the school\u2019s honor.In short, everyone loves Sister Yin!\u2026\u2026After two days, the city\u2019s joint exams finally ended.The city\u2019s test papers were turned in and scanned uniformly without bias from each school, so the results will be objective and fair.This was the first time that Huiwen students paid so much attention to average scores. They compared each other\u2019s performances. The forum was full of discussions about achievements.Song Zhaolin was playing with a mobile phone under the table when he suddenly pressed his head: \u201cFuck?\u201dThere was a new post in the forum: [Report!!! My cousin in No.1 Middle School said CJG\u2019s math score is 149!!]The post suddenly became viral. Even though it was during class time, there were many instant replies.Anonymous 1: Fuck, is he a monster?!Anonymous 2: It\u2019s so close to the perfect score, ahhh!Anonymous 3: Ah! I don\u2019t want Sister Yin to wipe the school gate QAQ! I\u2019m going to make trouble!!Chang Jinggeng\u2019s mathematics scores quickly spread. To be honest, this kind of score was hard to achieve even for science students.Huiwen\u2019s math scores had not been announced yet, and Chu Yin\u2019s English essays were very high. But if she didn\u2019t pass Chang Jinggeng\u2019s math scores, she would still lose the bet.Song Zhaolin was immediately worried.Han Chuying ran over after the class, and said anxiously: \u201cHe can support his arrogant attitude!\u201dThe math papers for the city\u2019s joint entrance exam are really difficult. There were about three hard questions. To be able to get 149 was not human level at all.\u201cWhat to do, if it weren\u2019t for me, Yin Yin wouldn\u2019t have challenged him.\u201dHan Chuying had struggled to not slap Chang Jinggeng in the face. But she still felt that she got Chu Yin involved.Jiang Yan hugged her: \u201cDo not blame yourself. You can\u2019t help it that he talks like that.\u201dSong Zhaolin also said: \u201cYes! After I read those screenshots, I want to go and curse him. That idiot!\u201dHaving said that, their faces became gloomy.Chu Yin smiled helplessly: \u201cCan you guys have a little confidence in me?\u201dThree faces suddenly turned around and looked at her blankly.\u201cSister Yin, you\u2026\u201d They asked carefully, \u201cCan you get higher than 149?\u201dChu Yin smiled and said nothing.Why not? She knew everything.\u2026\u2026Tutoring Class in No.1 Middle School.Many people were worshipping Chang Jinggeng\u2019s scores.In this exam, he got 287 in Comprehensive Literature, 149 in Mathematics, and also very high in Chinese and English.\u201cWill the pretty student in the other school come and clean our school\u2019s gate?\u201d\u201cHahaha, then I\u2019m going to hand her a rag!\u201dSome boys were kind and said: \u201cForget it, God Geng, she\u2019s a girl. What\u2019s the point of us being a man? What do you say?\u201dChang Jinggeng sneered: \u201cI didn\u2019t scold her at the time, but she jumped out and challenged me.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t all girls act like this? Maybe she\u2019s going out of her way to get your attention?\u201dChang Jinggeng smiled.\u00a0That\u2019s not impossible.If Chu Yin apologized to him seriously, then he could just nullify the bet. Chang Jinggeng took out his mobile phone and was planning to talk to Chu Yin in the Math group chat.At this moment, a person came in the door, suddenly panting\u2014\u201dFuck! The ranking list just came out!\u201d\u201cChu Yin\u2019s Mathematics is 150!\u201dWith this shocking news, Chang Jinggeng suddenly raised his head: \u201cWhat?!\u201dEveryone in the special training class of No. 1 Middle School was also shocked: \u201cIs this a joke!?\u201dWho knew that the person who came to report didn\u2019t catch his breath, and the next sentence was even stronger!\u201cChu Yin is the first in the city! The total score is 731!!!\u201d\u2026At the same time, the whole school of Huiwen was caught in a carnival.In this joint examination, Chu Yin ranked first in three subjects. Her Mathematics and English were perfect scores!She used her scores to slap the face of this idiot student fiercely and mercilessly.[On behalf of the whole school, I will send a rose of love to Sister Yin!!][Ah, It\u2019s so cool. I feel like I got first place in the city!][Me too!!! Why are we so passionate about this exam!]Although the average score of Huiwen was one mark below, the first place was with them!Now everyone couldn\u2019t wait to see Chang Jinggeng coming to wipe the school gate! !The city\u2019s ranking was announced to all schools. As soon as the results came out, the math group that Chang Jinggeng was in suddenly swarmed with countless people.[@ Huiwen \u2013 liberal arts sophomore \u2013 Chu Yin, Congratulations for winning first place on behalf of us girls!!][@ No.1 Middle School \u2013 liberal arts sophomore \u2013 Chang Jinggeng, come on, big brother, willing to accept defeat? Let\u2019s do it tonight.]Chang Jinggeng didn\u2019t believe that Chu Yin could actually defeat him!He never thought about what school gate he would clean \u2013 how could it be possible?Chang Jinggeng has been in this city since he was born. He has been a well-known genius student since he was a child.Make him clean the school gate for Huiwen?!Chang Jinggeng: [Did I say I accepted the bet?][Funny, from start to finish, you were looking for trouble.][It\u2019s only one point short, I did make a mistake this time, it doesn\u2019t mean that Chu Yin is better than me.]Someone in the group immediately scolded him: [Who are you? You can\u2019t accept defeat?!][Why don\u2019t you show off your dignity as a man? Do you regret being a man now? ]The chat history was posted in Huiwen\u2019s forum. The crowd was indignant. Everyone was scolding Chang Jinggeng for not being responsible.When the matter reached Chu Yin\u2019s ears, Chang Jinggeng had completely taken the route of an irresponsible human.Han Chuying sent her WeChat: [Look at this shameless man! Today\u2019s achievement has been achieved!][Chang Jinggeng: I don\u2019t know how to wipe the gate of Huiwen school anyway.][Chang Jinggeng: Who wants to wipe, I can pay for the detergent. Haha]Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe fool is indeed a fool.She thought for two seconds, then opened the script.[\u2026 After the announcement of the entrance exam results, Chu Yin won the bet. Chang Jinggeng became arrogant and went back on his words, which caused dissatisfaction among the whole school of Huiwen\u2026]It\u2019s hard to deal with these kinds of people.Chu Yin grabbed the light pen and marked \u201cwent back\u201d to \u201cdidn\u2019t go back\u201d.\u2014I will guard the integrity of this idiot \u221aThe Huiwen students scolded Chang Jinggeng for a whole day.-At the school gate-When school was over, they saw Chang Jinggeng carrying a bucket, holding a rag, with a look of grief and indignation.\u201cDamn\u201d\u201cHahahahahahaha.\u201d\u201cFuck, I want to take a picture.\u201d\u201cI doubted you, brother. I didn\u2019t expect you to have a backbone!\u201dHan Chuyin took Chu Yin to the window and appreciated the scene of Chan Jinggeng cleaning the school gate. She almost fell from laughing.Chu Yin pulled her back and smiled: \u201cDone venting?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so relieved!!\u201d Han Chuying said, \u201cWoo, you\u2019re my goddess!\u201dYin Yin must always be number one in the future! Not only in the city, but also in the province! Finally, another champion in the college entrance examination!To embark on the pinnacle of life!The fact that Chang Jinggeng came to clean the school gate of Huiwen spread around for a long time.After everyone finally got tired of eating melons, someone sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity, if Brother Zhen takes the exam, CJG would probably be third in maths?\u201d\u201cMaybe hahaha\u201d\u201cThen he will be even more sad and angry~\u201d\u2026\u201cBy the way, why do I feel like I haven\u2019t seen Brother Zhen for a long time?\u201d\u201cTo tell you the truth, I noticed the same.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The whole school praised her.Lu Zhen curled his lips and smiled.\u00a0Great.The young man sat on the edge of the bed, his white t-shirt was loose, his exposed skin was very pale, and the light blue blood vessels under his skin could be seen.He hesitated for a long time and sent a congratulatory message to Chu Yin.[Congratulations]After he sent the message, a triggering pain floated in his heart.Lu Zhen touched his chest.This is fine. This kind of pain has nothing to do with her.As of today, Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t count how many fragments he had dreamed of.Countless faces, endless emotions, jumbled like broken glass. When he knelt on the ground to pick it up, his fingers were cut, and endless blood poured out.In the last broken dream just now, he saw his\u2026mother.Her beauty faded, her expression dazed, and she mumbled something.Lu Zhen woke up in horror and suddenly realized that he seemed to have found the ticket to the second dream.Just like that day after he confessed under the moon, he had his first dream. Lu Zhen had a hunch that he could find the answer from his mother.Find the worst pain of all pain, and then\u2026understand everything.Lu Zhen got up, took off his crumpled clothes, and pulled out his coat from the closet with his upper body naked.Subconsciously, there was a voice asking.\u2026Do you want to go in?Into the black hole.If you don\u2019t go, you won\u2019t know. You\u2019ll continue to live dumbly.He could simply wait for the girl he likes to respond to himAlthough there was no hope, he could still chase.Lu Zhen tightened his fingers on the closet, two or three blue veins stretched out on the back of his hand.The cold voice he heard from the first night, telling him to die, came again.Can he still deceive himself? After knowing it could be true?Lu Zhen pinched the corner of his clothes and put on his clothes. His eyes were half-closed under his loose black hair.Even if he knew he would die.He had to endure it.\u2026Outside the nursing home.When the nurse saw Young Master Lu walk in at this time of the night, she was a little surprised.Lu Zhen nodded lightly. He didn\u2019t say hello nor alarmed anyone. As he did countless times in the past, he went upstairs quietly.Su Yumin wasn\u2019t asleep yet.Through the glass of the ward door, Lu Zhen saw her sitting on the bedside, swaying, and looking at the moon outside the window.Since she began to show resistance against him many years ago, Lu Zhen hadn\u2019t walked in front of her for a long time.But today, Lu Zhen held the door handle and slowly opened the door.Su Yumin didn\u2019t notice him at first.When she found out, Lu Zhen had already walked to her bedside, and the tall young man was silent, his silhouette visible under the moonlight.Su Yumin opened her eyes wide and suddenly began to shrink back. The calmness in her body broke and her expression looked terrified.Before, when Lu Zhen saw her showing such a look, he immediately went away.But this time he suddenly stretched out his hand and grabbed his mother\u2019s weak wrist.The scene that flashed by in the dream slowly overlapped with the woman\u2019s face at the moment.Lu Zhen took a breath and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201dSu Yumin\u2019s hand suddenly trembled.Lu Zhen was patient and waited quietly.He didn\u2019t know how long it took until Lu Zhen felt that his whole life was about to pass,\u00a0 he suddenly heard Su Yumin\u2019s whisper.Mumbling, low voice\u2026Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t hear her voice in his dream.Now, at last, he heard it clearly.In the middle of the night, Chu Yin saw Lu Zhen\u2019s message after finishing her homework.It took her two seconds to understand that she took first place in the city.Chu Yin snorted from the bottom of her heart.Dog man, it\u2019s a good dog.Suddenly Chu Yin scanned his WeChat name. She couldn\u2019t guess the meaning before, but now suddenly\u2026Four letters, facing his WeChat name.It turned out that Lu Zhen had already hinted very early.\u2026A dog man.Chu Yin casually sent back a two-character response, then threw the phone away and went to bed.Looking at it now, although the dog man had not completely given up, he was indeed very different from his previous life.If Lu Zhen no longer acted crooked in this life and no longer became the paranoid and crazy male lead in the future, then in this life, she would gradually forget the past.She may completely forget the person who had left the most profound impression in her life.In this way, one person would slowly forget his love and the other would no longer take revenge.All these mixed feelings they had together would turn into ashes\u2026it could be considered a successful life.With the particularly bright moonlight tonight, Chu Yin thought about a lot of things inexplicably.Then amidst various emotions, she gradually fell asleep.After a long time, there was a long and shallow breath in the room, and the girl fell asleep in the bed.At this moment, a familiar \u201cDing\u201d suddenly sounded in her brain.(T/N: Parts below contain suicide content. Please be advised. If it\u2019s triggering, please skip this part until my next t/ n.) *Lu Zhen opened his eyes in the early hours of the morning.The world was still quiet.And his eyes were dark and hollow, like a wasteland.Lu Zhen laid there, not moving for a long time, like a corpse.Finally, the dream came to an end. He finally came out of the black hole. He finally got the result he wanted to find.But in the end, he was heartbroken.\u2026Betrayed, hurt, and tortured.People who were in pain couldn\u2019t help but talk.Countless nights when he hugged her, she would scream silently in pain.Self-control and out of control. Deep love and pain.And that year after she left, he spent many years living like the dead. Alone.With a knife, he cut his veins.At the age of 17, on the night of early summer, Lu Zhen knew that his tragic life came to an end.In other words, the man who was at the end of the road returned to the year he was 17 years old.There was no joy of coming back from the dead. There was no luck to do it again.He was in pain as he thought\u2026She\u2019s doing well in this life.Smart. Excellent. Bright as a beam of light.She doesn\u2019t need me.That\u2019s good.*** ( T/N: End of triggering part. You can comfortably read below. ) ****\u2026Early the next morning, Chu Yin opened the door and walked out.Under the edge of the opposite wall, stood a boy in black.The cloth on Lu Zhen\u2019s shoulders was slightly wet as if he was standing there all night. His cheeks were cold and pale, and the mole at the end of his eyes looked red hot.Chu Yin frowned for a moment, walked up to him, and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201dThe voice was the same as before.Lu Zhen shuddered all over. He restrained his gaze and every burning desire he had.Lively, good, she\u2026His fingertips trembled for a long time. He didn\u2019t dare to lift them and touch her.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t wait for an answer, and raised her eyes impatiently: \u201cYou\u2013\u201cBefore she even finished speaking, she suddenly saw that a tear fell under Lu Zhen\u2019s right eye.He cried.Lu Zhen cried?The boy strode away quickly.And from that day on, Chu Yin found that Lu Zhen\u2026Had disappeared from her life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is there really nothing wrong with your health?\u201d Grandfather Lu sat on the sofa with a serious face while not being able to hide his concern when he looked at his grandson.Lu Zhen sat on the opposite side with a pale expression. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for worrying you, grandpa. I\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d Grandfather Lu scolded as he stamped his crane. \u201cTell me if there\u2019s anything wrong. You should get checked by a doctor!\u201dLu Linyuan, who was sitting on the side, quickly joined in and said, \u201cDad, don\u2019t worry \u2013 Azhen is already this old. He knows his own condition well.\u201dGrandfather Lu was concerned and confused. Lu Zhen had been outstanding since he was a child. He completely met the expectations and requirements of an heir \u2013 calm and mature. This time, he didn\u2019t know what caused his bad condition.Lu Zhen sat quietly on the opposite side.From this angle, he could see the light radiating behind his back as his cheeks were cast by a shadow. The young man\u2019s neat black hair was longer. A few strands fell above his eyebrows, looking a bit messy and casual.He (LZ)\u00a0 was still the cold and precious young master of the Lu family. But when Grandfather Lu looked at him, he felt that he (LZ) was different from before.Since Lu Linyuan answered several questions for him (LZ), Grandfather Lu snorted, \u201cReally?\u201dLu Zhen raised his head slightly and smiled: \u201cI\u2019m all right, Grandpa.\u201dHe won\u2019t let anything happen.Lu Linyuan coaxed Grandfather Lu back to his room, then went back to the living room and patted Lu Zhen on the shoulder jokingly. \u201cThis kid. You\u2019re really facing a big battle this time. If I didn\u2019t know any better, I\u2019d say you\u2019re lovesick.\u201dLu Zhen slightly raised his head. His pupils were calm as it stayed looking at Lu Linyuan\u2019s gentle smiling face for two seconds, before moving away.He smiled silently: \u201cNow way.\u201dSeeing the direction of his life in advance wasn\u2019t totally useless even if he felt pain from knowing everything.Because at 17 years old, he could see the true nature of people.Lu Zhen accepted his fault in his previous life by being tortured with the truth. At the same time, he also learned from its experience, skills, knowledge, and everything in it.The truth behind Lu Linyuan\u2019s smile would still be in this life.And he wouldn\u2019t let his most important person be touched by him (LL) again.Lu Linyuan laughed teasingly: \u201cWhat else do you have to say to me? It\u2019s probably a matter of love for a child your age to act like this.\u201dLu Linyuan continued: \u201cLet me guess\u2026 Is it the girl I have met several times? She must be your school\u2019s flower. Indeed beautiful.\u201dLu Zhen suddenly laughed, his lips stretched wider, which made Lu Linyuan\u2019s hair stand up\u00a01.\u201cUncle, I didn\u2019t know before that you have such a good imagination.\u201dHe didn\u2019t realize it in his last life. It turned out that Lu Linyuan had set his sights on Chu Yin so early.Lu Linyuan raised his eyebrows and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s because I care about you, so I\u2019m observant.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips curled as he nodded: \u201cBut you guessed it wrong\u2014Chu Yin, she looks pretty, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s heart jumped and his eyes slightly squinted. \u201cOh? How come?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s heart felt sore. He leaned back, his tone indifferent: \u201cIf you like her, you are free.\u201dLu Linyuan was stunned for a second before regaining his senses and laughed. \u201cAre you kidding me? How old do you think I am? Making me look like a beast?\u201dLu Zhen also laughed with him.His deep black eyelashes covered his dark pupils. They were filled with cold sarcasm.After smiling for a moment, Lu Zhen raised his eyes, and said lightly: \u201cThese are all trivial things \u2013 Uncle, let\u2019s talk about the land in the south.\u201dLu Linyuan said with a slow smile, \u201cOh, good.\u201dEver since Chu Yin met Lu Zhen that morning, the dog man didn\u2019t appear again for a long time.He probably still attended school but never went near her anymore. It took about a half month for them to meet each other by chance.He left after their eyes met for a brief second.Most of the communication between the two of them was initiated by Lu Zhen. After the rejection, Lu Zhen seemed to quietly retreat from her life.Chu Yin was skeptical at first. After all, the memory of the previous life was too deep. If the dog man suddenly changed, it would naturally be suspicious.But after observing the script for many days, she didn\u2019t find anything that could explain Lu Zhen\u2019s behavior. In the end, she had to conclude that maybe the dog man did really change.If he wouldn\u2019t be obsessed with her, then Lu Zhen in this life wouldn\u2019t be the same as before.But\u2026Chu Yin inexplicably cared about Lu Zhen\u2019s tears that morning.Although it was only a flash, she still saw it.He didn\u2019t look like he wanted to give up\u00a02. It was more like\u2026some kind of despair.Unusually, the young master showed this kind of emotion.It made her feel\u2026uncomfortable.Chu Yin thought for a while before pulling her mind back and continued to do the math exercises in front of her. She was still a little distracted even after doing two courses, so she simply put down her pen and drank a bottle of water.Walking out while holding the water bottle, many of her classmates in the corridor came up to greet her.Now Chu Yin gradually adapted to her popularity in school. She knew how to react with these over-enthusiastic students. After all, in the world of novels, this kind of exaggeration wasn\u2019t unusual.After the city\u2019s joint exam, the name of Chu Yin as the number 1 top student spread throughout the city. Not only was she famous in Huiwen and No.1 Middle School, but also around the schools in the city. Her amazing perfect math scores that forced Chang Jinggeng to wipe the gate of Huiwen was known by many.Because of this battle, Chu Yin had completely won the school\u2019s honor. She had become one of the precious students that needed to be protected. The students asked her before and learned that Chu Yin had no intention of going abroad and was preparing to take the college entrance exam!Her achievements made everyone vowed to protect her!Even the senior teachers were patient with Chu Yin whenever she needed help! Be attentive! Give her the answers and explanations for every academic question she had.As a result, as soon as Chu Yin went to the teacher\u2019s office, three or four teachers discussed together with the topic she asked.\u2026This, too, is an exaggeration.\u201cSister Yin, I also happen to refill my water bottle. Do you want me to refill it for you?\u201d Someone asked in the corridor.Then immediately there were several voices: \u201cI can do it too!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll refill for you too!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cNo, thank you\u2026\u201dShe quickly speeded up her pace, turned the corner, and unexpectedly saw Lu Zhen, who she hadn\u2019t seen for a long time.He seemed to have grown a bit taller, his facial features under his eyebrows were deeper, and his temperament was a little darker. He stood, lowering his head, saying something to Song Zhaolin who was beside him.Chu Yin\u2019s steps stopped and changed direction, intending to go away quietly.Song Zhaolin raised his eyes at this moment and howled happily: \u201cAh, Sister Yin!\u201dLu Zhen instantly raised his eyes.She shrank her shoulders slightly, in a pose that she wanted to slip away.A smile oozed from the bottom of Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes before he quickly covered it with his dark pupils. He felt bitter.The little girl in this life was so outstanding. No one would ignore her, and no one would look down on her. She didn\u2019t need him.That day, Lu Zhen recalled the events of his previous life for the first time. He was 27 years old when she told him to die in her dreams.He finally understood the meaning later.If he died, Chu Yin would be happy. She would have nothing to do with him, and\u2026no longer needed to bear any weight because of his love.So he stood outside Chu Yin\u2019s house until dawn, looked at her for the last time, and then told himself not to shamelessly disrupt her life.She was innocent and ignorant in this life. She won\u2019t remember being trapped by him. The days and nights she begged for freedom. Or her hatred and anger towards him.\u2014Lu Zhen had no chance to explain to her.If he spoke of this absurd event\u00a03, no one would believe him.God gave him a new life with the condition he keeps his memories. To remember, to repent, to suffer alone, and to silently protect her. This was his punishment.Lu Zhen knew that he should be more conscious.\u2026But he felt like trash. It was difficult to control himself.He clearly didn\u2019t need to come to school, but he still couldn\u2019t help it.Even if they couldn\u2019t get close, they could meet by chance.Perhaps in the corridor, on the open court, or in an unknown corner. He would see her.Song Zhaolin had already hopped over and said with a smile, \u201cSister Yin, didn\u2019t you see us?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe helplessly turned around and saw Lu Zhen standing a few steps away. His eyes indifferently met her before turning away casually, as if they were strangers.Chu Yin was suddenly relieved. She slowly relaxed her tight shoulders \u2014 since Lu Zhen had moved on, she didn\u2019t need to act like this.She nodded generously towards Song Zhaolin: \u201cI just saw.\u201dSong Zhaolin was startled: \u201cWhat! We are two handsome guys standing here, you didn\u2019t see us immediately!\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Chu Yin waved him away, \u201cGet out of the way, I\u2019m going to get the water.\u201d\u201cOh.\u201d Song Zhaolin obediently moved away.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t speak from beginning to end. His fingers were trembling in his trouser pocket.A few seconds of contact was enough for him to remember the days they spent.Song Zhaolin turned his head and saw Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes turning red. He was surprised and said, \u201cBrother Zhen, are you still not sleeping well?\u201dLu Zhen silently muttered, \u201cAh, I suddenly want to smoke.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be too busy. You\u2019re not an adult yet. Why take over the family business so early?\u201d Song Zhaolin whispered, \u201cThe old man is still so healthy. Don\u2019t you still have such a capable uncle on top of you? Don\u2019t make yourself so tired!\u201dLu Zhen smiled lightly. Song Zhaolin had not changed.After hearing his nagging, he suddenly asked: \u201cYanchuan has been very busy these days?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cYes! He\u2019s so busy, I don\u2019t know how many members in our family he wants to feed!\u201dLu Zhen looked at him innocently. Face, after a long while, suddenly raised his hand and patted Song Zhaolin on the shoulder.Lu Zhen looked at his innocent face. After a while, he suddenly raised his hand and patted Song Zhaolin on the shoulder.Song Zhaolin was sandwiched between him and his brother. He was forced to make a choice in their previous life.\u201cYou won\u2019t be in a dilemma next time.\u201d Lu Zhen said softly.Song Zhaolin blinked his pair of big innocent eyes. What? What\u2019s the dilemma?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She also continued to study after school, to improve herself.Without the dog man in the script, life became very simple.That day, Chu Yin came home from school and met Father Chu and Mother Chu who had been busy recently.This time, they couldn\u2019t wait to go back to their room to privately talk about this project of \u2018new town\u2019 and started their conversation in the living room.It had been some time since she heard about this project. It seemed that the marriage between the Chen family and the Chu family didn\u2019t save this incident. Father Chu\u2019s expression was anxious, and Chu Qiuqiu sat aside, her expression even more broken.Chu Shi saw Chu Yin enter the door, grabbed her wrist, and led her upstairs: \u201cYin Yin, go back to the room first, I will call you for dinner later.\u201dChu Yin nodded, \u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dBefore the door closed, she vaguely heard Chu Qiuqiu yelling: \u201cI can\u2019t lift my head in front of everyone if I do this!\u201dFather Chu\u2019s voice became even more anxious: \u201cWhat else can I do! The Chen family will stop cooperating with us now. Our Chu family is over!\u2019Chu Yin suddenly realized that in silence\u2014\u2014The timeline had advanced.The bankruptcy that would have occurred more than a year later was now in sight.What caused the timeline to change? Did something happen in the plot that she didn\u2019t know?Was it related to the previous special fluctuations?Chu Yin wasn\u2019t afraid of the Chu family going bankrupt. She had saved some money with various bonuses and money rewards the Chu family gave her. It was enough for a basic living.For her, this home was merely just a shelter.If her brother would get affected by this, she could just use her authority to protect him. As for the parents and her false sister, Chu Yin didn\u2019t care about them.It\u2019s just that Chu Yin thought of another thing.It seemed that the bankruptcy of the Chu family had nothing to do with Lu Zhen.So\u2026would those plots after the bankruptcy in her previous life happen again?Chu Yin silently thought for a moment. It was probably time to leave this home.The one-month duration of their bet was almost ending.During this period, Chang Jinggeng came every day to wipe the iron gate of Huiwen. He almost wiped the iron sheet bare.For a while, it became a great talk in Huiwen.He was often asked, \u201cHow can you be so faithful to your words?\u201dChang Jinggeng was ashamed and angry that he wanted to die.\u2014He didn\u2019t want to wipe it at all! But every day when school was over, his hands would consciously lift the bucket and take the rag. His feet wouldn\u2019t even listen to him!What else could he do but wipe this gate? ! After wiping for a month, there was not even a speck of single dust, and it was as clean as new!But no one knew of Chang Jinggeng\u2019s psychological condition.The students from both schools were in awe, thinking that although Chang Jinggeng lost to Chu Yin in grades, he still proved himself with his personality!When Chu Yin came out of the school, she happened to see him put away the rags. When Chang Jinggen saw her, he became even more embarrassed.\u201cI wiped it for a month now!\u201d He growled.Chu Yin: \u201cDo you mean you want to come for another month?\u201dChang Jinggeng closed his mouth.Everyone knew the betting agreements of these two top students. Now that these same people were finally in the same frame, many people were watching them.Chang Jinggeng replied: \u201cI only made a single mistake in the Math exam. I recognize you as an opponent.\u201dChu Yin was indifferent.\u00a0 \u201cWhatever.\u201dWhat else did he want to say?Suddenly, there was a commotion from No.1 Middle School. Someone yelled, \u201cGod Geng, excuse me!\u201d Then a boy emerged from the crowd.\u201cClassmate Chu Yin, Wei Heming has something to say to you!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s important!\u201dA group of people from No.1 Middle School came to support him.Wei Heming is a senior in a high school, tall, thin and white, with a pair of glasses on the bridge of his nose, looking very gentle.Wei Heming was a third-year senior in No.1 middle school. He was tall, thin, and white. He had a pair of glasses on the bridge of his nose and looked very gentle.\u201cSenior Chu Yin, I\u2026\u201dHe had always looked at her from a distance. This was the first time he stood in front of Chu Yin. Glancing at her black eyes, he felt that his heart was beating too fast.\u201cI\u2019m Wei Heming, a third year senior, from No.1 middle school. I\u2019ve been accepted by Q University. I just want to tell you that I always like you very much. I\u2019ve been paying attention to you since you came to the neighboring school to participate in the English Speech Contest\u2026\u201dThe crowd was surging at the school gate.The excellent and beautiful Sister Yin was confessed to by a gentle and handsome man in the No.1 Middle School.Everyone was shouting.Song Zhaolin tiptoed to the center of the crowd and looked over: \u201cOh! I can\u2019t see! What are you talking about! The man is handsome! Did Sister Yin accept?!\u201dHe was so restless that he couldn\u2019t help but turn around and said: \u201cCan\u2019t see! I\u2019m so anxious that I could die!\u201dLu Zhen stood a few meters away, his lips pressed tightly.Because of the force, the corners of the lips were a little pale.He had exhausted his life\u2019s self-control to the point he didn\u2019t charge and kicked the man away.He even wanted to beat him violently.Lu Zhen sincerely hoped that Chu Yin would only focus on studying and would have no intention of falling in love.Then he could lie to himself for a few years. If he had handled everything, and if she was still alone1\u2026Then he would come to her and ask for another chance.But she was so good, no man wouldn\u2019t like her.The girl he hugged tightly before didn\u2019t belong to him, she had the right to choose.She could like\u2026others.Lu Zhen\u2019s fingers touched the lighter in his trouser pocket. As if he had been burned, he slightly trembled.A knife hovered above his chest. Chu Yin was holding its handle.He didn\u2019t know how long it took, but the surroundings became noisy again.Song Zhaolin\u2019s surprised voice was sandwiched between them: \u201cFuck! What did the man say! Sister Yin actually left with him?!\u201d-She left with him.The sharp knife pierced down, slashing his flesh.Lu Zhen closed his eyes exhaustedly.Let\u2019s go.\u2026The scandal between Chu Yin and the male student from No.1 Middle School quickly spread throughout the school.Wei Heming, a student scouted by Q University in Bachelor Since, was low-key, handsome, and seemed to have no shortcomings.The students of Huiwen said with tears that although they didn\u2019t agree to this marriage, they didn\u2019t have any choice.Chu Yin himself was stunned after learning of the rumors \u2013 because that time, Wei Heming said that he had a stack of intensive mathematical knowledge frameworks that he could give to her, so Chu Yin followed him.How come they were spreading this rumor to the point of them getting married??Imagination really had wings.However, she made it very clear to Wei Heming that she just wanted to study hard and pass the college entrance examination. She currently had no plans to fall in love. Wei Heming respected it and didn\u2019t force her, but said he would wait for her.This kind of thing was very personal. Chu Yin couldn\u2019t clarify it to others so she had to pretend that nothing had happened.After a few days, no one would take the initiative to ask her. She would often be met with the eyes of a parent marrying off their daughter.Very ashamed.In the afternoon self-study, Chu Yin went to the office to ask the teacher questions, and several teachers came around to inquire about Wei Heming.\u201cNo. We\u2019re not. Don\u2019t listen to those false rumors.\u201d TheThe teachers happily said, \u201cWe are not old-fashioned! This child is really excellent! You can focus on this matter\u00a02\u00a0when you reach college!\u201dChu Yin walked out of the classroom with her shoulders collapsed and sighed.Wei Heming was pretty good, but she really had no interest in such a boy who was too excellent.Chu Yin walked in the corridor for a while, and when she looked up, she suddenly saw Lu Zhen standing in the opposite direction.She didn\u2019t know why but his eyes seemed to be very dark this time.When he saw her this time, his eyes stayed for a few seconds before moving away slowly.Chu Yin paused for a second and had no intention of saying hello.Thinking about it, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t have any reaction to this absurd scandal. It appeared that he moved on.Chu Yin turned around and went upstairs.Unexpectedly, after stepping on the first step, there was a \u201cpa\u201dThe school\u2019s electricity outage was out of power.There was no window in the stairwell, and everything suddenly fell into darkness.Chu Yin stood on the stairs, her whole body stiffened instantly, and the hand holding the notebook squeezed tightly.She was afraid of the dark. She had been afraid since she was young.No one would pay attention to this kind of small problem, so she wouldn\u2019t mention it to others. No one in this world probably knew that she was afraid of the dark to the point she could faint.She was standing in a semi-closed position. A sense of dizziness violently came to her.\u00a0 Chu Yin\u2019s whole body trembled as it slowly collapsed.Anxious footsteps could be heard in the darkness.Then there was the sound of someone falling and hitting the wall.Chu Yin had no time to mind other things. She was dizzy as she leaned back on the armrest. \\\u2014But she did not fall.Instead, she fell heavily into a person\u2019s arms.In the darkness, the person\u2019s body temperature was boiling. The palm of his hand habitually squeezed her ear bone, while his other hand gently rubbed her head.\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s voice was raspy.Chu Yin\u2019s ears were ringing so bad that she couldn\u2019t hear any sound at all. Her head buzzed, instinctively grabbing the corners of the man\u2019s clothes.\u201c\u2026Don\u2019t go either.\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s breath was hot.You\u2019re afraid of both the insect and the dark. When you eat cold food, you get period cramps. If you eat food quickly, you get stomach discomfort. You like sweets, hate sours, and like small flowers.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know\u2026but I do.\u201dHis low and hoarse voice was broken into silence.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He didn\u2019t need to deceive himself.He could look at her at this moment.His eyes traced every inch of her greedily, just like someone who had been starved for a long time. His pupils were dark and bright.Because of the sudden power outage, the students screamed in joy\u00a01. Their learning momentum was broken.The further the distance, the quieter this corner became.Lu Zhen hugged her in the dark, lightly rubbing the back of her head.Even though Chu Yin never mentioned her fear of the dark, Lu Zhen already knew. He thought of all the possible reasons for this and guessed that it had to do with what she experienced as a child.She was only a small child when she got separated from her family. He didn\u2019t know what she experienced, then, but it was probably the darkroom she was put in that led to Chu Yin\u2019s eternal fear.So when he discovered this, Lu Zhen would leave the night light turned on every night.But, by then, being with him was probably the same darkness.Lu Zhen tasted bitterness again.Chu Yin\u2019s breathing was slightly ragged. Her breath swept Lu Zhen\u2019s neck, making him clench his jaw.She (CY) hadn\u2019t calmed down yet. If she had, she would have angrily pushed him away after hearing Lu Zhen\u2019s mumbling.Lu Zhen cherished every second of this moment and felt the need to thank the sudden power outage.Thank you for letting him be the only person she could rely on at this time.Unfortunately, the circuit was quickly repaired.Lu Zhen wanted to ask.Do you like that man\u00a02? Is he good?But amidst these thoughts, he closed his eyes and endured the suffocating pain in his heart. He restrained himself, slowly letting go of her, and turning around to leave.A minute later, the world regained its brightness.The students sighed in disappointment.Chu Yin\u2019s eyelids sensed the light. It took her a long time to finally relax before she slowly opened her eyes.Many people walked out of the corridor and saw her standing alone on the stairs. They were surprised and asked: \u201cSister Yin, are you alone? Were you scared?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face was a little pale, but her heart rate became normal. She casually nodded, \u201cSomewhat.\u201dShe had lived two lives and never mentioned her fear of the dark to anyone, nor explain its origin.After she got lost when she was a child, she suffered at the hands of the Wang family for her disobedience. When she became more disobedient, the Wang family only knew to correct her simply and cruelly\u00a0 \u2013 locking her in the woodshed for a day.The woodshed had no windows nor lights. For a five-year-old child, this almost made her crazy.\u00a0 After that incident, she could no longer stay in the darkness.Over the years, Chu Yin healed herself.She felt unwell from the sudden blackout, but not to the point of being completely unconscious.\u2026So that person just now, was Lu Zhen?Although she didn\u2019t hear what he was talking about, she was familiar with Lu Zhen\u2019s breath.He touched her ear and the back of her head. Lu Zhen loved to do this in her last life, making her feel a slight soothing feeling.Chu Yin frowned slightly,\u00a0why is the dog man so skilled?Was it because they\u2019re the same person that their behaviors were the same?Chu Yin didn\u2019t know whether she had made any noises when she started to feel dizzy. She only met Lu Zhen after she came out of the teacher\u2019s office. Meeting Lu Zhen at that time didn\u2019t make sense.But he seemed\u2026to appear too timely. Almost as if he knew she was going to fall.Chu Yin thought about it for a few seconds. In the end, she could only attribute this to the male lead\u2019s halo.He smoothly walked to her without hesitation and came over to help\u2026Did she unconsciously voiced her panic?Chu Yin shook her head.\u2026Chu Yin calmed down for a while before slowly making her way back to the classroom.When she returned to her seat, she noticed that Song Zhaolin had placed a scented candle on her table in an exaggerated manner. After lighting it, the surrounding air was filled with a faint freesia fragrance.Chu Yin took a breath and commented: \u201cYou\u2019re quite emotional.\u201dSong Zhaolin looked up and saw her: \u201cOh, sister Yin, this is your candle. I took it just now! Hehehe!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d Damn you.\u201cThis candle is not enough to cover the power outage, okay?\u201d Chu Yin slapped his shoulders, \u201cAnd this thing is not mine!\u201dSong Zhaolin smiled foolishly: \u201cIt\u2019s yours! Wei Heming gave it to you. I smelled this candle for you, it smells good. He has good taste!\u201dChu Yin slapped him again. She was mad at her stupid son.\u201cIf you know it\u2019s someone else\u2019s, you can\u2019t touch it. How can I return it if you already light it?\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s mouth opened into an \u2018O\u2019 shape: \u201cAh? Why return it?\u201dAccording to rumors, Sister Yin was getting along well with the young man. There would be forum posts every day from students that said: \u201cIf you\u2019re heartbroken, we\u2019ll see each other on the rooftop.\u201dFrom that post, dozens of students would then reply, \u201cWait for me.\u201dAlthough Song Zhaolin was sitting next to Chu Yin, he didn\u2019t know any first-hand gossip about this for two reasons. First, Chu Yin didn\u2019t take any initiative to talk about it at all. Second, Song Zhaolin himself was a little bitter and didn\u2019t ask first. He just concluded that the two of them were going well.At this time, a bunch of people in Class 5 was secretly listening, especially boys like Zhao Yuxiong, who wanted to make their ears ten times bigger.Song Zhaolin lived up to their expectations and asked, \u201cThis candle is not from your boyfriend\u2013\u201cChu Yin: \u201cShut up.\u201dSong Zhaolin obediently zipped his mouth.Chu Yin was about to explain when she suddenly remembered Song Zhaolin\u2019s big mouth. If she explained it to him, it would surely reach Lu Zhen\u2019s ears.This misunderstanding was not totally harmless.Chu Yin thought for a while, but she only said tactfully: \u201cDon\u2019t think about these things every day. The end of the term is coming soon. Do you still have the time to pay attention to these?\u201dWhen she said that, everyone around bowed their heads.Chu Yin solemnly said: \u201cMoreover, our eyes should only focus on the final exam! In a few months, our senior sisters and brothers will have the college entrance examination, and soon, we will take that same responsibility! Therefore, we must have a certain sense of urgency and walk towards the crossroads of life seriously!\u201dSong Zhaolin was blinded by the light coming from her body and felt a strong feeling of \u201cI am not worthy\u201d from the bottom of his heart.\u2014He had been guessing whether Sister Yin was with Wei Heming. Was he even worthy to think such things? Most of the top students had signed under top universities and Sister Yin was the future college entrance examination champion \u2013 while he was just living under the shadow of his brother\u2019s fist!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It shouldn\u2019t! It\u2019s not too late to change! From now on he should study hard!After hearing what Chu Yin said, all the students were ashamed \u2013 let\u2019s study! To study to be worthy of a sister!In the future, if they failed to pass the Q test, they wouldn\u2019t be worthy to confess to Chu Yin!The whole class, especially the boys, suddenly became enthusiastic about studying.Chu Yin heaved a sigh of relief, sat down, picked a workbook, and calmed her mind by doing math problems.After a while, Song Zhaolin lifted his head from the book, leaned over, and said quietly. \u201cSister Yin, it seems that you don\u2019t like Wei Heming very much, but you also don\u2019t like Brother Zhen\u2026\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyebrows were slightly crinkled.Although Song Zhaolin was naive, he wasn\u2019t entirely stupid.This thought just passed through her mind. Then she heard Song Zhaolin\u2019s shy voice as he hesitantly asked:\u201cThen, you also don\u2019t like me?!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe was wrong. Now, this son is really stupid\u2014!!\u201cGo away!\u201dFather-son love will never be the same thing, okay! Never!After the blackout, the young master of the Lu family became more diligent.Although Lu Zhen had been studying business and working in the company before, in the minds of Lu\u2019s directors, he was still a young man.There was a certain age gap between him and Lu Linyuan of the second generation of the Lu family. In terms of identity, Lu Zhen was certainly an impeccable successor, but in terms of age and experience, it was more appropriate to contact Lu Linyuan for many things.Fortunately, Grandfather Lu was not old enough to abdicate yet, so Lu Zhen could raise his wings for a few more years. And when he could truly stand alone, Grandfather Lu could hand over the entire Lu family to him.Recently though, Grandfather Lu found that Lu Zhen seemed to be more mature than he thought and had grown up quietly. His recent performance in several projects was so outstanding that the board of directors could not find any fault, which made Grandfather Lu feel proud and relieved.The Lu Zhen of the previous life had experienced enough brutal life lessons. He couldn\u2019t just sit still and wait for death in this life.Because of Lu Zhen\u2019s ability, Grandfather Lu handed over several projects that were originally meant for Lu Linyuan. At the same time, the entire board of directors also began to reassess Lu Zhen.Lu Linyuan was also very surprised. After the end of the board meeting, he patted Lu Zhen on the shoulder: \u201cYou\u2019re doing a good job, Ah Zhen. You\u2019re even better than my elder brother.\u201dWhen several directors heard him mention Lu Zhen\u2019s father, they nodded one after another: \u201cLike father, like son!\u201dThe corner of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips slowly pulled up. \u201cIs that right?\u201dLu Linyuan and several directors recalled the past with a smile. Lu Zhen smiled and listened in the audience. He doesn\u2019t care about Lu Linyuan\u2019s subtle means.Several directors chatted with emotion as they planned to have a drink and continue the chat.Lu Linyuan turned around and called Lu Zhen: \u201cAh Zhen, let\u2019s go together.\u201d\u201cYes, young master, come with us.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t treat the young master as a child now\u2013\u201cLu Zhen smiled and said, \u201cUncles, I\u2019m still a minor. I can\u2019t join you yet. Moreover, I have other things to do today.\u201dLu Linyuan and several other directors expressed their regret before leaving.Lu Zhen went back to the office alone, processed all the documents, and then looked down at his phone.The text message he was waiting for had finally arrived. The other party obviously thought about it for a long time before sending out an address.The corners of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips finally curved a little.\u2026\u2026A riverside restaurant in City A was known for being private.Lu Zhen walked in calmly. A waiter immediately stepped forward and respectfully led the way.He (LZ) waited for a while in the best box before the door was opened again and a young man walked in eagerly.As soon as he sat down, his eyebrows wrinkled: \u201cYoung Master Lu, what made you think of me?\u201dLu Zhen raised his eyes and looked at the face that looked just like Song Zhaolin.He knew Song Yanchuan\u2019s character \u2013 he was only here to test his intentions. Even before the tea could be served, Lu Zhen went straight to the point: \u201cYou intercepted the project in the new city\u00a01?\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s sloppy expression changed slightly.Two seconds later, he sneered: \u201cThe Lu family has a big business. What does the young master want to know? Does the young master Lu want to get involved too? Or is this for whom?\u201dThat little girl that day\u2026Lu Linyuan had set his eyes on her. Lu Zhen must not have noticed it.Lu Zhen smiled, \u201cMr. Song thinks too much.\u201d\u2014What\u2019s the relationship between the business of the Chu Family and him?From beginning to end, there was only one person Lu Zhen had to protect.Even if the Chu Family fell, he didn\u2019t care. He could give her better options while silently protecting her for the rest of her life.Song Yanchuan frowned at the sound.In his eyes, Lu Zhen was just an excellent cannon fodder.Song Yanchuan knew very well about Lu Linyuan\u2019s power. He was also aware of his terrible character, so he believed that Lu Zhen would not be able to take over the Lu family in the future. He had even helped Lu Linyuan do things. When the Lu family\u2019s future changes, the Song family could take advantage of the wind.He only came here to test the truth. No matter what Lu Zhen found out and what he would say to him, Song Yanchuan would not be moved.Lu Zhen\u2019s slender fingers rubbed the rim of the china teacup as he softly spoke, \u201cMr. Song, you placed the Song Family in the hands of my uncle. Have you ever thought about the risk of relying on a tiger in your life?\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s pupil shrank \u2014 how much does Lu Zhen know?!The contact between him and Lu Linyuan was not even known by his family. Song Zhaolin had no idea about this at all. Lu Linyuan had an excellent reputation in the circle. He had a harmonious relationship with his nephew as his uncle.His expression changed a little as he felt, with a sense of absurdity, that he was being crushed by the young man in front of him. \u201cYoung Master, what do you know?\u201dThe Song family didn\u2019t have deep roots compared to the Lu family. They couldn\u2019t be as respectable as Lu Zhen. Everything they had now was earned step by step. The Song family worked hard for two generations to raise Song Zhaolin, a carefree idiot. How could they contradict Lu Zhen?Lu Zhen\u2019s expression was flat. There was no emotion in his dark eyes.\u201cYou\u2019ve been to the nursing home. Do you know what he did to my mother?\u201dSong Yanchuan was taken aback.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes slightly and didn\u2019t elaborate. But after a while, he mentioned the four-piece of land gently.This time, Song Yanchuan\u2019s face changed completely.If Lu Zhen knew that his contact with Lu Linyuan was strange, then he knew that this four-piece of land would make Song Yanchuan feel that he had seen a ghost.Lu Zhen finished his order. And only then did he finally push a cup of tea to Song Yanchuan\u2019s hand and give the power to decide.\u201cIt\u2019s better to trade with a bad guy than to seek the skin of a tiger who could bite you from behind.\u201d Lu Zhen dismissively said, \u201cOnce you go out and call my uncle, everything will be done. You will meet your end.\u201dAfter a pause, Lu Zhen added the last tip: \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u2026make things difficult for Linzi.\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s expression finally loosened upon hearing these words.\u2026An hour later, Song Yanchuan got up and left.He\u2019d been a businessman for many years. Whether the other party had real information, whether he had the real ability, and whether he would become a good partner, he could feel it after a few words.During this hour, Song Yanchuan felt a steady stream of fear.It was obvious that Lu Zhen was only 17 years old this year. Where did he get the vision and experience?!Before leaving the restaurant, he couldn\u2019t suppress the absurdity he felt in his heart and turned around to take a look.Lu Zhen looked at the river view and drank the cold tea.With half-closed eyes, his youthful face had a kind of unspeakable silence and desolation. He looked like a devil who was quietly awakened in a story.After the new city project cooled down, the Chu family\u2019s capital chain would completely fall and the bankruptcy would be irreversible.The Chen family terminated the cooperation, not taking into account the feelings of the marriage between the two parties.At present, the news had only spread in the rich circle. Most people in the school didn\u2019t know that Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s prized fiance status was gone. Or that the Chu sisters would soon be Miss Qianjin.2In the anxious atmosphere of the whole family, Chu Yin was the calmest and indifferent one.She should eat, study, and be completely unconcerned until the house gets confiscated to pay off their debts.Chu Qiuqiu scolded her angrily: \u201cSister, why don\u2019t you care about the situation? Are you not worried about your parents? How can your heart be so hard!\u201dChu Yin said calmly, \u201cBecause you care more than me. Ah, go quickly, this is the time when they need your little cotton padded jacket.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s mood suddenly became better.She lowered her head weakly and wanted to cry: \u201cXuanyuan, our house\u2026I don\u2019t have anything now, I only have you.\u201dChen Xuanyuan laughed. With a somewhat arrogant tone, he said: \u201cBut we are no longer in a relationship.\u201dChu Qiuqiu burst into tears. \u201cYou, you don\u2019t want me?\u201dChen Xuanyuan looked at her face and thought of a person that had a similar face to hers.He sneered evilly: \u201cChu Qiuqiu, you are no longer the young miss of the Chu family, I hope you put yourself together!\u201dWhen the marriage was announced, Chen Xuanyuan was tightly guarded by Father Chen. He could only meet Chu Qiuqiu which bored him to death! Now that god finally opened his eyes \u2013 the Chu family went bankrupt and the marriage was now over!Chu Qiuqiu was stunned: \u201cWhat, what do you mean?\u201dChen Xuanyuan laughed: \u201cYou are just a stand-in.\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was in shatters: \u201cWhat stand-in?\u201dChen Xuanyuan leaned over, propped her chin with a finger, and smiled: \u201cI don\u2019t have you in my heart at all! I like your sister!\u201d-Yes, that\u2019s it! Show that unbelievable appearance! Go and confront Chu Yin!Let the two sisters quarrel and fight for him! Only in this way could he comfort his inner pain for so long!Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face was blue and white. In the end, she couldn\u2019t stand the insult, she bit her lip and left.Chen Xuanyuan ate a meal in a good mood, and then returned home. The life of a wealthy family was cold-blooded. His father had forbidden him to communicate with the Chu family, but Chen Xuanyuan had his own plans.He returned to the room and called Father Chu.Chen Xuanyuan made a few words of courtesy before expressing his intention lightly: \u201cAlthough the marriage between our two families is over, I am a very kind person. My father is not willing to help you, but I have some funds in my hands. Actually, the one I liked wasn\u2019t Chu Qiuqiu, but another one\u2026\u201dFather Chu couldn\u2019t understand.After Chu Yin went home that day, she felt that the atmosphere wasn\u2019t right. Father Chu, who was struggling with bankruptcy, started to talk to her kindly.Things were different, Chu Yin knocked on the system and read the script, and understood \u2013 Chen Xuanyuan, this disgusting thing, hadn\u2019t given up on her.It\u2019s not hard to guess the thoughts of Father Chu. Chu Yin found it ridiculous, but it wasn\u2019t surprising. When she was by Lu Zhen\u2019s side in her last life, the parents kept suggesting that she should rely on Lu Zhen\u2019s relationship to help her family.It\u2019s the same in this life. They wanted to use her to trap the Chen family.At the dinner table, Father Chu took the initiative to inquire about Chu Yin\u2019s recent studies and paid special attention to whether she was associated with anyone.Chu Qiuqiu knew that she was used as a substitute by Chen Xuanyuan. And her gaze towards Chu Yin was extremely resentful at this time \u2013 why does everyone like Chu Yin?!\u201cDad, don\u2019t you know, my sister is with the young man in the No.1 Middle School?\u201dFather Chu frowned immediately, \u201cNo. 1 Middle School? What kind of students are they from? They are not worthy of you.\u201dChu Yin made her laugh.Father Chu didn\u2019t receive any response from her. He gave a dry smile and said, \u201cLittle Yin, you are familiar with the son of the Chen family. The relationship between our two families still exists. Xuanyuan likes you very much, you see\u2026\u201dBefore Chu Yin could speak, her brother suddenly broke the cup in his hand.As the eldest son of his family, he has been very busy recently. Even his original plan to go abroad had temporarily been put on hold. Chu Shi thought that even if his family was not as good as before, the small business he had was enough to support the family. The Chu family could still be a haven for his sister.But now, he wanted Chu Yin to leave this disgusting family.\u201cDon\u2019t you feel ashamed to say this?\u201d Chu Shi looked at his father coldly.Father Chu\u2019s face was red and white. He angrily said, \u201cWhat shame! Isn\u2019t it an important matter to contribute to the family?\u201dChu Shi stared at him indifferently for a moment, stood up, and took Chu Yin\u2019s hand. They got up and went back to the room.Father Chu was still furious. \u201cWhat kind of attitude are they showing?!\u201dAt another time, Chu Qiuqiu would have comforted Father Chu promptly to show that she was considerate and sensible. Right now, she was too lazy to pretend.Chu Qiuqiu only cared about how to keep her wealthy status and how to make Chu Yin unhappy.Back in the room, Chu Shi touched Chu Yin\u2019s head, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I won\u2019t let you go to Chen Xuanyuan.\u201dChu Yin nodded.\u201cI have a house left outside. Xiao Yin, you move there for a while. Don\u2019t stay at home,\u201d Chu Shi seemed to have grown a lot overnight, his eyes were gentle and reliable, \u201cBrother still has a small business. You won\u2019t starve.\u201dFortunately, the foreknowledge of the dream at the time made Chu Shi plan ahead. When bankruptcy came, it wasn\u2019t difficult to accept. He had already started his own business apart from the Chu family. At this time, he could become the last support of the whole family.Chu Yin shook her head: \u201cBrother, I can live in a dormitory. You can sell the house. Don\u2019t work too hard.\u201dShe only cared about him. If she could, she hoped that her brother could ignore the Chu family, but she knew that Chu Shi couldn\u2019t do it.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Chu Shi smiled, \u201cWith me, you will always have a family.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyes were hot for a moment.But Chu Shi had some words hidden in his heart that he didn\u2019t say.He just had a little worry. Although there was a big gap between reality and dreams. Since the bankruptcy had happened just like in his dream, will those things\u2026also happen?\u201cThe student from No.1 Middle School\u2026\u201d Chu Shi thought for a while. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. I\u2019ve inquired about him. He\u2019s good.\u201dChu Yin helplessly said: \u201cBrother, don\u2019t listen to other people\u2019s nonsense.\u201dChu Shi smiled. \u201cI think he is almost better than Gu Qiuze.\u201dHe had no right to interfere, but the person who could accompany Chu Yin in the future must be the person who would love her most in the world. It should be someone who would be nice to her, won\u2019t let her be wronged at all, and give her the whole world.Chu Shi thought that as long as the bastard Lu Zhen showed any sign, he would fight to the death. He wouldn\u2019t allow him to succeed.\u2026Chu Yin\u2019s actions were very fast.She said she didn\u2019t want a real house, no matter how he tried to persuade her. She contacted the school dormitory directly, through the headteacher, and checked the situation in advance.The students who lived in the dormitories were generally good students with ordinary families and were living far away, so the dormitory conditions were very general.The dormitory building was a bit away from the school building. It was almost June, and there was no air conditioner in the dormitory.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The teacher heard about the situation of the Chu family. She was a little worried that Chu Yin couldn\u2019t adapt to the conditions of the dormitory, which would affect her studies and trouble her.But Chu Yin thought it was nothing. Before she was taken from the countryside, the conditions were much worse.She went through the check-in procedure very quickly and then paid the dormitory fee.The accommodation fee in Huiwen was a little bit more expensive than the university, but it was much cheaper than staying in a hotel or renting a house.Chu Yin thought this was good too. It just so happened that she could get more sleep in the morning, and could study in the classroom at night.When she packed her things and left Chu\u2019s house, her parents were not there, and Chu Yin didn\u2019t plan to bid farewell at all.Standing at the door with her arms folded, Chu Qiuqiu said bitterly, \u201cSister, has Xuanyuan looked for you recently?\u201dChu Qiuqiu said: \u201cYou don\u2019t have to play hard to get. He showed you his enthusiasm. In fact, he also did it with me. Chen Xuanyuan is just playing with you. \u201cChu Yin put her small luggage into the trunk of her brother\u2019s car, clapped her hands, and felt that this was also a problem.After finally being able to leave the Chu family and live on her own, how could she let Chen Xuanyuan bother her?Chu Yin opened the script and took a look.\u3010Chen Xuanyuan broke up with Chu Qiuqiu and thought about going to Chu Yin every day.\u3011\u3010Now that the Chu family has fallen, Chu Yin has become a delicate flower for anyone to pick. Chen Xuanyuan thought excitedly:\u00a0If you don\u2019t make a move at this time, when will you make a move?!\u00a0\u3011Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dChu Qiuqiu still said: \u201cEven if you move out, Xuanyuan will definitely go to you, sister. I hope you won\u2019t be cheated by his sweet words.\u201dLooking at Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s sour expression, Chu Yin suddenly thought of a solution once and for all.She struck out the word \u201cbroke\u201d in this script and changed it to \u201clocked\u201d.Chen Xuanyuan and Chu Qiuqiu are locked up! Ah ha ha!You two, for generations to come, love each other well!After Chu Shi drove Chu Yin away, Chu Qiuqiu immediately contacted Chen Xuanyuan again. Although she also knew that this man was not a good choice, she couldn\u2019t completely abandon him until she found the next high-quality stock.God seemed to be helping her. For several days, even though the other male classmates did not respond to her, Chu Qiuqiu found that she could always find Chen Xuanyuan who had been avoiding her.Chen Xuanyuan also felt strange. He clearly came to find Chu Yin, but he would see Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s face every time. Not only that, he couldn\u2019t find other women!He couldn\u2019t get rid of Chu Qiuqiu!It was another chance encounter. Chen Xuanyuan finally got angry: \u201cYou, woman, are you following me!?\u201dChu Qiuqiu came over and put her hands on her waist and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t! It\u2019s just our destiny\u2026 \u201cChen Xuanyuan was so upset that he slapped Chu Qiuqiu in the face: \u201cWhat status do you have that you deserve to be with me?!\u201dChu Qiuqiu was slapped by him. When she recovered, she scratched Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s face.\u201cYou slapped me in the face?!\u201d\u201cCrazy woman! Let go! Let me go!\u201d\u201cYou did it first!\u201dThe two people fought in the street.A passerby reported them and they were sent to the police station.After Chu Yin moved into the dormitory, she found that the air conditioner was installed.She was originally worried that the school gave her special treatment, so Chu Yin asked about it and found that the entire dormitory was installed with air conditioners one after another.She heard that someone just happened to donate money to the school, specifically pointing out the need to improve the dormitory environment.Besides the air conditioner, all the mattresses had been upgraded with thicker and more comfortable mattresses. There were even improvements in the dormitory\u2019s water use.Chu Yin didn\u2019t think too much, just felt that she went to the dormitory at a perfect time.As Chu Yin moved into the dormitory, the news of the Chu family\u2019s bankruptcy also spread like wildfire.Friends from all walks of life came to show their concern.Jiang Yan, a little princess in her family, heard the news and hugged Chu Yin, \u201cYin Yin, would you like to live in my house? The school dormitory building looks very old from the outside. How uncomfortable is it for you to live? \u201cHan Chuying also pulled her aside: \u201cIt\u2019s okay to live in my house. Our family is actually quite rich.\u201dSong Zhaolin pushed her back: \u201cIt\u2019s fine for Xiao Yan to say it, but you can\u2019t, Chuyin! I seriously doubt your intentions.\u201dHan Chuying: \u201cI don\u2019t have any!\u201dSong Zhaolin looked serious: \u201cWipe your saliva!\u201dHan Chuying hurriedly raised her sleeves.Then Song Zhaolin turned his head and said to Chu Yin with a smiley face: \u201cSister Yin, you can live in my house too \u2013\u201cChu Yin: \u201cGo away.\u201dShe was a little helpless.\u201cThe school dormitory has air conditioning and a bathroom. It\u2019s not as bad as you think.\u201dBut Jiang Yan still thought that bankruptcy was a very serious matter: \u201cBut you don\u2019t have a source of livelihood. What will you do to eat and buy things in the future?\u201dBefore Chu Yin said anything, Song Zhaolin suddenly started: \u201cNo, I won\u2019t let that happen to Sister Yin! We can do crowdfunding!!\u201dWhen he mentioned it, people in the class responded: \u201cWe can too!\u201dChu Yin pressed Song Zhaolin back: \u201cYou can only fundraise for sick people!\u2019Song Zhaolin: \u201cAh? Is that so? What should we do!\u201dAlthough Chu Yin refused the help of others, she had to think about making money.Now she had to pay her own tuition. After all, Huiwen was a high-end private institution, and the tuition for a year cost quite a lot. Coupled with accommodation fees and food, clothing, and housing, she was indeed not very wealthy.But now she was underage. Many places won\u2019t accept her. What\u2019s more, Chu Yin spent most of her time studying. She couldn\u2019t spare her energy to work long hours.Chu Yin hugged her arms and pondered for a while, wondering if there was anything that wouldn\u2019t delay his studies.Unexpectedly, she was lucky, and the English teacher called her to the office the next day.\u201cThe teachers have heard about your situation, and everyone is very concerned.\u201d Seeing the girl\u2019s calm and strong appearance, the English teacher showed pity, \u201cSomeone just came up and gave me some English manuscripts and asked me to find someone to translate. \u201cChu Yin\u2019s eyes lit up and she understood the teacher\u2019s intention.\u201cThese manuscripts do have a certain degree of difficulty, but I am not worried about your English level. The price offered by the other party is very high. If you pass the standard of translation, he will come to you in the future\u201dChu Yin was a little surprised that the price was far higher than the market price, and she could earn tens of thousands after all the translation. Besides, she could also learn English as a translator, which was the most suitable job at present. However, Chu Yin was a little surprised that she was so lucky.\u201cThank you, teacher! I\u2019ll do it well!\u201dThe English teacher patted her gently. \u201cGo ahead. The client is not in a hurry, so don\u2019t worry! Don\u2019t stress yourself.\u201dChu Yin smiled and nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dLooking at her leaving the office with a stack of manuscripts, Lu Zhen slowly looked away.Song Zhaolin stuck his head behind him: \u201cHey, isn\u2019t that Sister Yin? Why did she go to the teacher\u2019s office?\u201dLu Zhen retracted his gaze and said lightly, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dSong Zhaolin sighed, shaking his head, \u201cWoo, our Sister Yin is so miserable. After being brought back by the Chu family last year, she hadn\u2019t enjoyed any blessings! The Chu family went bankrupt so fast!\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes and said softly, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dSong Zhaolin didn\u2019t understand what he said. He thought of something else: \u201cOh, her little boyfriend \u2013 ah no, Wei Heming. I heard that he seems to be looking for a tutor job for Sister Yin.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s expression immediately became a little ugly.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t notice it at all: \u201cThis person is good. He is very concerned.\u201dLu Zhen pressed the corner of his lips and couldn\u2019t hold back: \u201cWhat can he give her?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s heart tightened. He didn\u2019t reveal any more of his emotions.Lu Zhen took a deep breath and turned to leave.He was the only one who could provide for her.But what to do.His little girl\u2026 didn\u2019t want him.Chu Yan planned her schedule again and stayed after school to translate every day.She was working in the classroom when someone came over and told her that the whole school would have a power outage.Chu Yin was worried about the blackout. She didn\u2019t dare return to the dormitory. She packed up her things and went to the cafe outside the school.She sat by the window, ordered a latte, and then worked on her translations seriously.Looking out the window, she didn\u2019t know when the rain started.Chu Yin didn\u2019t notice because she was frowning and fretting about the manuscript in her hand.Some parts were really difficult. She hadn\u2019t used English for too long and it took her a long time to finish.At this moment, a gentle voice came from the side, \u201cHey, girl~\u201dChu Yin looked up, suddenly startled. She knew the foreign grandfather in front of her.Mr. Brown warmly pointed to a difficult word in her manuscript. He slowly explained in English: \u201cI think you have been stuck on this word for a long time? This means \u2018silent\u2019 and \u2018restrained\u2019.\u201dChu Yin returned to her senses. She laughed and replied in English: \u201cThank you.\u201dMr. Brown was Lu Zhen\u2019s foreign teacher. She studied under him for a long time in her previous life. This grandfather was nice. Even if they didn\u2019t know each other in this life, they were still harmonious.After a few words of communication with her, Mr. Brown was surprised at her English level. He simply moved a chair and sat down to help Chu Yin translate the most difficult one.After finishing, Chu Yin let out a long sigh of relief: \u201cThank you so much.\u201dMr. Brown put on his hat and blinked with a smile: \u201cLittle lady, I had a good time. See you next time.\u201dChu Yin smiled.She finished the part she planned. She put away her things and opened the door of the cafe.The rain hadn\u2019t stopped, but it was getting lighter. Chu Yin raised her head and looked at the sky, planning to rush back with her bag.At this moment, a figure came over in the rain.Wei Heming walked to her under the umbrella, and looked at her carefully: \u201cSister Chu Yin, I\u2019ll send you back.\u201dChu Yin hesitated.Wei Heming quickly pointed to her bag: \u201cI saw that you are writing a manuscript. This seems important. It won\u2019t be good if it gets wet.\u201dChu Yin thought the same so she didn\u2019t refuse. She stepped forward and walked to him.Wei Heming quickly shifted the umbrella canopy to Chu Yin\u2019s side.In the dense rain curtain, the boy and girl shared a single umbrella as they gradually walked away.Lu Zhen stood far away and watched. The hand holding the umbrella handle gradually tightened.This was the second time he watched her walk away with another guy.The air in the rain was humid, but Lu Zhen felt that his lungs were empty and he couldn\u2019t breathe.She (CY) didn\u2019t remember anything in the past, so there was nothing he could do.She could lean on another guy and walk away with a smile.Maybe in the future, she would lie in their arms.Being kissed by them.Being\u2026Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes became hot. A sense of overwhelming feeling overcame his heart.He could do everything behind her back. He just didn\u2019t have the qualifications to walk in front of her.Because he had nothing to do with Chu Yin.Next to the black umbrella, a checkered umbrella appeared.Mr. Brown said in the rain, \u201cZhen, you asked me for help. But look at the boy, he can hold an umbrella for her.\u201d\u201cYou lost.\u201d He said with a playful smile.Mr. Brown didn\u2019t know the deep and fierce love Lu Zhen had. He just thought of it as a competitive pursuit among young children.But every word from him pierced into Lu Zhen\u2019s heart.There was a tangy taste in Lu Zhen\u2019s throat, and he smiled slowly: \u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHe already lost long ago.There was no chance in this life.\u201cBut, It\u2019s very strange,\u201d Mr. Brown said. \u201cWhy is this kid\u2019s pronunciation so familiar? It\u2019s as if I taught her myself.\u201dLu Zhen was startled.Mr. Brown was still saying, \u201cIt\u2019s really familiar.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes suddenly trembled.A faint thread was gently pulled from the ashes, stringing up some forgotten details.Speech contest, her pronunciation.Fighting, her familiar posture.Her opposite behavior from this life to the previous life. She loves to study. She wears a school uniform and a mask. From the beginning, she rejected him for no reason.\u201c\u2026Is this what you, Chinese people, call fate?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s heart jumped wildly. In his dying despair, he suddenly saw a glimmer of hope.\u2026Fate.If it was fate.Then save him.T/N: For those readers who don\u2019t like chapters being divided, I just want to say that I can\u2019t help but divide them.

The people she cared about were also in school where she could see them whenever.Chu Shi came to Chu Yin\u2019s dormitory to deliver food and reported to Chu Yin about the current situation at home.Her family property would be sold to pay off their debts. Chu Qiuqiu\u00a0had completely disappeared out of sight. She\u2019s been contacting boys within her wealthy circle every day. Even Zheng Yu had gotten annoyed by her and complained to Chu Shi.Chu Shi knew that she was trying hard to find a home to be able to maintain her wealthy life. This was the same as his dream. He was not surprised or disappointed.But it\u2019s strange to say that Chu Qiuqiu used to be regarded as a little beauty that could make a group of boys chases her, but this time only Chen Xuanyuan was willing to be entangled with her.\u2014Speaking of this matter, Chu Shi also told her that Chu Qiuqiu and Chen Xuanyuan fought in the street.After listening, Chu Yin was silent for a few seconds.As expected of Chen Xuanyuan and Chu Qiuqiu, this \u201clocking\u201d method was so unique.Chu Shi took the opportunity of delivering things to visit the dormitory for a while. After looking around, he found that it was indeed better than he expected.The washing machine was newly purchased, and there were two on each floor. Because few students were staying, it was very convenient to use. There were air-conditioners and water heaters in the dormitory.\u201c\u2014\u2014So don\u2019t worry, my roommate said that if there are good-hearted people donating money, the school\u2019s housing conditions will get better and better,\u201d Chu Yin said soothingly, \u201cBrother, you just need to take good care of yourself.\u201dAfter seeing off Chu Shi, Chu Yin went back to the dormitory to sort out her translation of the manuscript.She had already contacted the client.She would hand in part of the manuscript today as she had made special corrections before going to bed last night.She took the manuscript and went to the agreed place. The client was a young uncle wearing a suit and leather shoes.After reading her manuscript, he praised her greatly.\u201cWhen your teacher informed me before that he had found a student interpreter, I was a bit worried. After all, you are still a high school student.\u201d The uncle laughed. \u201cBut now I don\u2019t have to worry. We will find you if we need your services in the future.\u201dChu Yin breathed a sigh of relief: \u201cThat\u2019s good, thank you.\u201dShe had nothing to do now after she handed over the manuscript.The place the client and her agreed upon was a little far away from the school. She was considering whether to take the subway or the taxi. Suddenly, she saw a familiar car parked not far away.In the driver\u2019s seat was Song Yanchuan. With the window open, he leaned on the door with one hand while talking to someone.Chu Yin looked over and saw Lu Linyuan unexpectedly.These two secretly met in private. How could this be considered a coincidence?Chu Yin subconsciously walked behind the big tree on one side.It seemed that Lu Linyuan and Song Yanchuan had cooperation? \u2013 The reminder that Song Yanchuan told her\u2026why would he tell her to be aware of her safety? Was Lu Linyuan a dangerous person?From her last life, she couldn\u2019t see any relationship between the Song family and the Lu family. After all, she didn\u2019t know Song Zhaolin that well. But she at least knew that the Lu family industry that Lu Linyuan was in charge of wasn\u2019t connected to the Song family.Had the power structure of the Lu family changed?Chu Yin pondered for a while, realizing that she couldn\u2019t see anything so far away, so she opened the script and read it.Unexpectedly, there was a short dialogue in the script.\u3010Song Yanchuan: \u201cThe project for the new city has been completed. What are your plans?\u201dLu Linyuan: \u201cNow that the Chu family has fallen, I feel pity for the little girl. She should be in need of comfort now.\u201dSong Yanchuan gave an ambiguous \u201ctsk\u201d\u2026\u3011Chu Yin was stunned\u2014New City?They intercepted the project that caused the Chu family to go bankrupt?She didn\u2019t expect that she had wrongfully blamed Lu Zhen for this matter.\u2014But she vaguely remembered that Lu Zhen had expressed disdain for the new city project. At that time, Chu Yin thought he was provoking her. Although it was a project that could bankrupt the Chu family, it was not worth mentioning to the Lu family.What was the purpose of Lu Linyuan\u2019s move?No more details were written on the script.Soon after, the door of the car was opened. Lu Linyuan got out of the car, tidied up his suit, and gracefully walked towards his car, which was parked right next to it.The windows of the car were covered with black anti-peeping covers. No one could see the inside of the car.Chu Yin turned down a page of the script and found out his next destination\u2014the nursing home.Another mass of information came, and Chu Yin\u2019s heart jumped slightly. Her sense of doubt became stronger.What was the relationship between Lu Linyuan and Su Yumin? Why did Lu Zhen take her to see Su Yumin back then? He obviously hadn\u2019t wanted her to just chat with Su Yumin.What was the purpose of Lu Linyuan deliberately contacting her in this life? If it had nothing to do with Lu Zhen, what did Lu Linyuan want?In the midst of this, it seemed that the plot was guiding her to discover something, could it have something to do with her experience in the previous life? Chu Yin couldn\u2019t think clearly for a moment.But she knew that she wanted to know the truth.After Lu Linyuan\u2019s car drove away, Chu Yin slowly walked out. Even if the script was guiding her, she should go and see it.Chu Yin raised her hand and stood on the side of the road to hail a taxi.But what stopped was the private car she had just seen. Song Yanchuan poked out half of his face from the window with a calm expression: \u201cYo, little sister, what a coincidence.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyebrows raised: \u201cElder Brother Song.\u201dSong Yanchuan looked at her and said, \u201cWhere to? Shall I give you a ride?\u201dChu Yin stood on the side of the road. She looked down and saw a familiar address in Song Yanchuan\u2019s navigation record, which was obviously deliberate.Unfortunately, she was going there.\u201cNo need,\u201d Chu Yin smiled, and pointed to the back. \u201cThe taxi is here.\u201dSong Yanchuan was not very enthusiastic, but nodded: \u201cThen you go.\u201dChu Yin got in the taxi and told the driver the location of the nursing home. \u201cDon\u2019t take this road \u2013 go across it.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s car had just left. It would be troublesome to meet him along the way.In the hidden corner of the street, Lu Zhen raised his head slightly in the car.There was a stack of translation manuscripts from Chu Yin on his lap, and his finger fell on the paper, trembling.Chu Yin\u2019s inquiry, curiosity, alertness, and the direction she was heading.He had secretly planned all of this and at this point, he could finally be sure.\u2014She remembers.Lu Zhen\u2019s breathing was very hot. He felt a burning sensation inside him.Fate kept you from forgetting me.And also let you remember.He remembered the little details now. A clear guess came to his mind \u2013 those seemingly ridiculous events were probably all related to her.Lu Zhen wanted to laugh. The corners of his lips curled up. That\u2019s good.She could do it all over again. She deserved this preferential treatment.That world is garbage. Fortunately, you escaped it.Lu Zhen remembered his rapid heartbeat as he confessed to her\u2026what kind of face had she looked at him with? She probably had shown deep hatred.But in this life, even if he knew that she might want to kill him, Lu Zhen felt like he had come back from the dead.He really was a greedy beast.If she didn\u2019t remember, he would endure everything by himself. But since she remembered, he had vague hope.After she passed away that year, his boundless and invisible constraint had finally disappeared.\u00a01Despite the cold and lonely dream of his, Lu Zhen still wanted to go back to that year \u2013 when they left high school\u2026the period when he was loved by her.Even if he didn\u2019t deserve her in any lifetime, he still wanted a chance to explain to make her understand clearly.\u2026Song Yanchuan opened the door and sat in.The place where Chu Yin handed her manuscript was planned by Lu Zhen.He had chosen the place where he (SY) and Lu Linyuan would meet to deliberately let her witness.\u201cMaster Lu, thanks to you, I\u2019m finally on the side that I want.\u201d Song Yanchuan said.Lu Zhen smiled.\u201cBut, is it necessary?\u201d Although he chose Lu Zhen, he still didn\u2019t understand his series of operations. \u201cPutting so much time and effort in order to make her vigilant and protect herself?\u201dLu Zhen smiled lightly: \u201cI\u2019m saving myself.\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s eyebrows raised. He went speechless for a moment before he could find his voice to ask, \u201cThen you\u2019re not afraid that something might happen to that girl? And your mother\u2026\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cI have people in the nursing home.\u201dHe paused and said, \u201cMoreover\u2026I need to go now.\u201dAfter arriving at the sanatorium, Chu Yin didn\u2019t go to the front desk to inquire.She still remembers the location of Su Yumin\u2019s room. It would be the third room from the bottom on the fourth floor.Chu Yin\u2019s heart beat a little fast, vaguely knowing that she would uncover something. She couldn\u2019t stop even if she knew the dangers ahead.However, no matter how dangerous it was, it was within the scope of the script.When she reached the top of the stairs, Chu Yin saw someone standing at the door of the ward.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to startle the snake, so she simply searched for this sentence in the script and changed the [someone] to [no one]. The corridor suddenly became empty and quiet.She walked over quietly.There was a piece of glass on the door of the room. Chu Yin stood on tiptoes and squinted to look in.Lu Linyuan turned his back to the door, stretched out his hand, and hugged the peaceful woman on the hospital bed.Su Yumin gently hugged back. Lu Linyuan approached her ear affectionately and whispered. There was a lot of soundproofing in the ward. She couldn\u2019t hear what he said.Chu Yin suddenly widened her eyes and put her head back.\u2014What kind of bloody plot is this?!Many thoughts popped up in Chu Yin\u2019s mind for an instant. One of the most obvious was \u2013 if it weren\u2019t for Lu Linyuan\u2019s age, she simply doubted whose son Lu Zhen was.But\u2026if Lu Linyuan fell in love with his sister-in-law after Lu Zhen\u2019s father passed away, it would not be considered wickedness.She could see Lu Linyuan\u2019s deep affection.Chu Yin lowered her eyes. She had no plans to look any further.But then she suddenly remembered Lu Linyuan\u2019s attitude towards her outside the school that day.His smooth and skillful words. How could he not be seen as a deep-hearted man?A sense of absurdity went up to her spine for no apparent reason.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know why. She suddenly knocked on the system: \u201cUnlock the script.\u201dAfter a \u2018ding\u2019 sound, the script unfolded. Chu Yin glanced and her pupils suddenly shrank.Lu Linyuan gently hugged the woman. He then whispered in the most tender of tones:\u3010\u201dBitch.\u201d\u3011\u3010\u201dWhy are you not dead yet?\u201d\u3011Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What kind of trash is this man?I want to vomit!!Chu Yin was so angry that half of her brain was wondering how to make Lu Linyuan\u2019s life bloody and cruel.But the other half of her brain came up with another thought\u2013Does Lu Zhen even know what Lu Linyuan truly looks like?In her impression, Lu Linyuan was like a brother and a father to Lu Zhen and had always treated him well.Although last time, it was known that Lu Linyuan was not as harmless as he looked on the surface, this time she suddenly discovered the most unknown and darkest side of him.That Lu Linyuan treats his mother like this,\u00a0 does the teenage Lu Zhen know?Once\u00a0Lu Zhen knows\u2026 what can he even do?At Lu Zhen\u2019s current age, he simply couldn\u2019t compete against Lu Linyuan. Lu Zhen\u2019s father had passed away early and even if Lu Linyuan hadn\u2019t formally taken over the industry, he still had an advantage of ten years compared to Lu Zhen.Although the future Lu Zhen would end up having a great role in the business world, he was only a young master at this moment without any of the real power of the Lu family.Plus, Lu Linyuan had dealt with the black market industry for so many years. The extent of his involvement in the gang had never been mentioned to others. He had so many people in his circle. Even now, he was wooing Song Yanchuan to his side.Deep speculation came into Chu Yin\u2019s mind \u2013 Had Lu Linyuan accepted that the inheritance would be given to Lu Zhen just as he was showing?If Lu Linyuan wants to seize power, how did Lu Zhen defend the Lu family in his past life?She never seemed to have thought about this problem before.Some vague memories started to pour out. Chu Yin shook her head.She had welcomed too much information in less than an hour, her brain was buzzing now.She stood up from the wall and decided to leave this place first. She needed to calm down and think about countermeasures.But \u2013 at this moment, a person came from behind her with a smile.\u201cLittle classmate? Why are you here?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s ears tingle in anxiety. The hairs on her body stood up as she turned to the voice and saw that the door of the ward was already opened.The scene was a bit scary, but Chu Yin instinctively adjusted her expression the moment she looked up: \u201cMr. Lu? Hello?\u201dLu Linyuan stared at her condescendingly, with a soft smile on his face: \u201cWhat are the chances of me running into you in this nursing home?\u201dChu Yin suddenly felt like she was being stared at by a poisonous snake. Her expression remained unchanged: \u201cI came to visit someone\u2014 you as well?\u201dLu Linyuan stared at her and smiled.This girl came at the right time when the guards were nowhere to be seen. He didn\u2019t know where those guys went. It didn\u2019t matter. This was just a woman.Just like the woman inside the room.Women are all the same animals.The hunter should first gently approach them, acquiring their trust, and when he has slowly penetrated their lives, he throws them in the mud. He will then become the only person they would be willing to reach out to.Although it sounds simple, it\u2019s stressful.However, the \u201cprofit\u201d is much greater than the cost. Because\u2026 the hunter can make the prey abandon everything she originally had.The little girl in front of Lu Linyuan was the same age as Su Yumin back then\u2026 and now that the Chu family had just gone bankrupt, Chu Yin\u2019s reputation plummeted.Even if his dear nephew couldn\u2019t distinguish girls, Lu Linyuan was still interested in her.Lu Linyuan slightly smiled. He looked at Chu Yin and said with regret. \u201cI heard that something happened to your family. You must be very sad now. It was a coincidence that I met you here today. Why not\u2026\u201d\u2014 \u201cNo.\u201d\u2014 \u201cUncle.\u201dThe two voices sounded at the same time. There was even the same indifference.Lu Linyuan\u2019s eyebrows suddenly jumped, and at the same moment, Chu Yin\u2019s shoulders quietly shrank.\u2014How could he come! So unlucky!She\u2019s finished!Lu Linyuan\u2019s thoughts immediately turned. His smile raised as he looked at the figure walking in the distance. At that moment \u2013 the light lamp above his head suddenly fell off without warning!The lamp disc dropped from the ceiling.\u2014It smashed heavily into Lu Linyuan\u2019s smiling face.Chu Yin felt guilty,\u00a0 but also secretly felt happy: Ah! This feels so good!!!While Lu Linyuan was acting coyly just now to her, Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help but open the script and change the [ fell ] to [ smashed ] .[The lamp above his head\u00a0 smashed his face.]Looking at it now, this perverted uncle didn\u2019t have the halo of a male protagonist like the dog man!Dare go and insult women again!! You smelly trash!!Lu Linyuan cried out in pain. He couldn\u2019t help but swear in anguish as he clutched the bridge of his nose. His hand raised as he squinted at Lu Zhen. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019m fine.\u201dLu Zhen walked over, his eyes glancing at Chu Yin first.And\u2026Chu Yin looked like she was trying to avoid embarrassment by hiding her face. But from\u00a0 Lu Zhen\u2019s point of view, her apple cheeks showed her dimples when she bit her lips.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes trembled when a slight smile appeared. However, when his gaze moved over to Lu Linyuan, his expression was controlled, \u201cAre you okay?\u201dLu Linyuan was obviously in pain as his nose was almost broken.The people working under Lu Linyuan hurried over to help him, knowing that they had made a big mistake.As they brushed shoulders, Lu Zhen said to Lu Linyuan, \u201cUncle, I\u2019ll come here in the future. You don\u2019t have to worry so much.\u201dAfter hearing this, Chu Yin, who rarely shared an enemy with the dog man, said in her heart:\u00a0Yes, stay away from people\u2019s mothers! Go away!Lu Linyuan covered the bridge of his nose. His eyebrows nervously picked up.Lu Zhen turned his head to look at him with a calm expression. \u201cI\u2019ve already talked to the dean of the nursing home. He knows I\u2019ll be the one coming here in the future.\u201dLu Zhen would slowly remove Lu Linyuan\u2019s people in the nursing home. Although he knew that it was already too late, at least, he wouldn\u2019t allow Lu Linyuan to continue his evil ways.Lu Linyuan narrowed his eyes and smiled: \u201cOf course,\u00a0 child, this is what you should do.\u201dLu Zhen nodded, \u201cUncle has worked hard.\u201dLu Linyuan finally left and the corridor became empty again.\u2026Lu Zhen first went into the ward to check Su Yumin before turning around.Chu Yin\u2019s eyes rolled.Since the day of the blackout, Lu Zhen never appeared in Chu Yin\u2019s sight again except for today, when she had stepped into matters that were related to her previous life, and discovered many things she didn\u2019t know.Looking at him now, the mood felt a bit\u2026subtle.Lu Zhen silently\u00a0 inhaled a deep breath and kept his voice calm as he\u00a0 asked, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dChu Yin felt guilty.Lu Zhen shouldn\u2019t know that she secretly came to see Su Yumin since she didn\u2019t even know her in this life!Chu Yin raised her hand and touched the tip of her nose: \u201c\u2026Came to see someone.\u201dLu Zhen controlled his raging emotions and then slowly gazed at her face. His dark pupils showed indifference, but his heart was beating hard.It was you and me back then and now, it\u2019s you and me today.They both remember.Their intense love and hatred spanned across the river of time.Lu Zhen had a lot that he wanted to say. Although the world was silencing him, the pain he felt was still fresh within his memory.Although he had planned everything to lead her here, he still didn\u2019t know how much Chu Yin remembered and how much he could continue to explore.Lu Zhen felt lucky. He didn\u2019t have to worry about her at all.They faced each other, standing on opposite sides.\u201cAre you done?\u201d Lu Zhen asked softly.Chu Yin hesitated: \u201cAh.\u201dIt was the sense of justice in her heart that was at work.Chu Yin was wondering\u2026Whether she should tell Lu Zhen or not?But how would she say it? Tell him that his uncle was evil? And that he was mentally abusing his mother? Tell him that he shouldn\u2019t get close to him?\u2014But how would she explain how she knew that?That she happened to visit the nursing home? Happened to come to this ward on this specific floor? Happened to see his mother being hugged by his uncle? And supernaturally heard his uncle whisper in his mother\u2019s ears?No one would believe that.She didn\u2019t want to help Lu Zhen at all \u2013 the dog man didn\u2019t need her help. However, Chu Yin was still upset from the situation she saw a while ago. Even if she smashed Lu Linyuan\u2019s face with the lamp just now, she would still feel sick from the fact that the pervert had been doing this for many years.Chu Yin\u2019s emotions were tangled.She didn\u2019t know that every inch of her expression fell into Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes.This gave Lu Zhen a little hope.Did you find out? How much can you guess?Since the light lamp was broken, the corridor was a little dim. Lu Zhen slightly lowered his eyes.Chu Yin decided not to tell him. She would rather focus the attention on herself than let Lu Zhen know anything.She put her hands behind her back, and said, \u201cNot yet, I\u2019m going to see the person now.\u201dThe light in Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes dimmed a bit, but still, he smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201dChu Yin turned to leave, but when Lu Zhen looked at her, he couldn\u2019t hold back his urge to ask, \u201cChu Yin, your boyfriend\u2026why didn\u2019t he accompany you today?\u201dChu Yin stopped, half turned\u00a0 her head, and said, \u201cNext time.\u201dLu Zhen bitterly smiled.He was\u00a0 cheap. He had no defensive mechanism against Chu Yin, and even a few words could make his heart hurt.Chu Yin didn\u2019t say anything more as she turned and left.\u00a0 Her soft brown hair flickered in front of his eyes, and Lu Zhen\u2019s heart jumped for a moment.He suddenly wanted to prove that there was no one like them in this world.Wei Heming couldn\u2019t, and neither could Gu Quize.Even if this problem would kill my heart.Then, go on, kill.Chu Yin calmly walked deeper into the corridor. At that moment, Lu Zhen\u2019s voice suddenly sounded behind her.\u201cYou\u2019re just leaving,\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s voice trembled slightly, \u201cThen what should I do with the light lamp?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you\u2026 make it fall?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He knew everything about her that no one would understand.Their love and hate were strong. No one would be as deeply connected as them.So can you not\u2026look at anyone?Chu Yin\u2019s footsteps stopped in an instant.Lu Zhen took a deep breath again.Jealousy could blind a person. He didn\u2019t want to ask her this so early.It was just his vague speculation. He could guess from the sudden falling of the light lamp, the knives that fell from the sky, the basketball that weirdly exploded, the broken glass door, and the car accident. There were similarities between all of those.But Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know the extent of her power or in what form she could influence the things around her.So his question was very vague. There were different ways of answering it.At this point, Chu Yin\u2019s thinking was surprisingly the same as him.\u2014What did the dog man find?? Okay, the light lamp falling out of the blue was indeed\u2026familiar.But it stood to reason that a character who hadn\u2019t awakened his self-awareness couldn\u2019t think of a possible outcome like this. Even if Lu Zhen was a male lead, he shouldn\u2019t know that this world was a book, let alone had the possibility of changing the plot.Chu Yin quickly pondered this sentence and found that the meaning was very vague, almost like he was waiting for her answer.If she subconsciously refuted, Lu Zhen might be able to guess more things.Dog man! Sinister and cunning!!In half a second, many thoughts flashed in Chu Yin\u2019s head. She slightly turned sideways, her expression was a little surprised: \u201cDo you want me to pay for it?\u201dShe shouldn\u2019t let her character break even if her \u2018good-student character got ruined before. She must act well. Although she had bad interactions with Lu Zhen so many times along the way, she still felt guilty.He must have not guessed anything now. She needed to be more cautious.Lu Zhen could guess what she was thinking, so he pushed down his restless heart.He knew that he couldn\u2019t force her. There were still things to do right now. It would take some time to test Chu Yin\u2019s \u201csuperpowers\u201d.Lu Zhen began to feel that there must be some cause and effect. He didn\u2019t know what happened to the world after he passed away in his last life.Now that they returned to this year, perhaps the world gave Chu Yin the preferential treatment following a certain logic.He looked forward to all the possibilities related to her.Lu Zhen bent down and picked up the half-broken disc from the ground. He lowered his head and smiled: \u201cNo, I\u2019ll pay.\u201dChu Yin kindly nodded her head, \u201cI\u2019m really poor.\u201dAfter thinking about it, she felt something was wrong: \u201d \u2014But we don\u2019t need to compensate the hospital for this\u2026\u201dShe almost bit her tongue after speaking.She fell into the dog man\u2019s logical trap. It was correct logic assuming that the light falling was related to them. After she reacted, she controlled herself and said, \u201cYeah, if there\u2019s nothing, I\u2019ll leave first. I have something to do.\u201dLu Zhen nodded, \u201cOkay\u201dThis time, she left with no hesitation, walking fast with her head down, as if she wanted to escape the scene quickly.Lu Zhen watched her disappear at the entrance of the corridor, and then looked away.Chu Yin probably didn\u2019t know this, but thanks to her, it would take Lu Linyuan a while to recover from his injury.Lu Zhen would not waste these golden hours.He had to finish this faster so he could stand before her cleanly.Chu Yin secretly went to the nursing home twice. She was relieved when Lu Linyuan, the old pervert, didn\u2019t come back.She didn\u2019t know if Lu Zhen would be wary around Lu Linyuan. But since he arranged someone new to take care of Su Yumin, the situation had gotten better.It would have been nice if the light lamp was bigger that time! It should\u2019ve smashed Lu Linyuan\u2019s head completely!However, when Chu Yin returned to school and saw Song Zhaolin, her mood became slightly complicated.Song Zhaolin didn\u2019t know about his brother\u2019s cooperation with the old pervert. If Lu Linyuan was plotting against the Lu family\u2019s properties in the future, Song Zhaolin\u2019s brother must stand on Lu Linyuan\u2019s side to fight against Lu Zhen. Song Zhaolin would be in deep trouble when that time comes.He certainly considered Lu Zhen as his brother. He certainly didn\u2019t want to choose between his two brothers.Song Zhaolin was such an innocent little fool. Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to see him sad.\u201cWhat are you thinking, Sister Yin?\u201d Song Zhaolin asked, licking a lollipop.Chu Yin didn\u2019t look at him and just patted Song Zhaolin\u2019s head. \u201cDon\u2019t ask questions to an adult, kid.\u201dSong Zhaolin became angry, his pufferfish face shouted: \u201cWe are the same size!!\u201d\u201cThat is temporary,\u201d Chu Yin calmly said, \u201cI\u2019ll be older than you in a few months.\u201dWith that, she was distracted for a second.She would be an adult for another year.When she was eighteen in her last life, a lot of things happened that made her remember deeply.Song Zhaolin hummed.The older Lu Zhen got, the less frequent he could be seen. They could only hear about him in the socialite\u2019s circle. They were no news about Lu Zhen in the school, but outside, Lu Zhen\u2019s daily activities were being broadcasted almost daily.In Song Zhaolin\u2019s impression, Lu Zhen could be regarded as a living Buddha. Since he (LZ) was born, he had everything. Now, he grew up so fast and became independent overnight.\u201cOh. Why don\u2019t you relax? You\u2019ve been studying every day.\u201d Song Zhaolin looked at the exercise book in her hand. \u201cThe city\u2019s joint exam is already done. You can relax now.\u201dChu Yin looked up and saw all the students in Class 5 were seated on their seats, studying. \u201cIsn\u2019t this good?\u201dSong Zhaolin cried: \u201cI think I\u2019m beginning to feel out of place! Why is everyone working hard! \u201cWas he the only one looking forward to the summer festival??This was one of the last activities before school would end!!Song Zhaolin yelled at Zhao Yuxiong, \u201cSports Committee Leader, don\u2019t you think our summer festival will be too uninteresting?\u201dZhao Yuxiong raised his head, quickly glanced at Chu Yin next to him, and said solemnly: \u201cClassmate Chu Yin is right. We should focus on studies now.\u201dSong Zhaolin: Why you pretending??He couldn\u2019t accept this so he called out Jiang Yan. \u201cXiao Yan, shouldn\u2019t the public committee organize this festival?\u201dJiang Yan waved her hand: \u201cBusy.\u201dSong Zhaolin suddenly felt lonely.He turned his head hopelessly, and looked at the initiator of all this: \u201cSister Yin, don\u2019t you want to play? The summer festival is interesting. Each class builds a small stall for themselves to sell things.\u201dChu Yin replied: \u201cOh.\u201d\u201c\u2026The income is owned by the class. Everyone can share it evenly. Last year, a class made a lot of money from it!\u201dChu Yin Suddenly raised her head: \u201cI\u2019ll participate.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c???\u201dShe forgot about this at first. The summer festival was indeed profitable!Soon, the news that Chu Yin would participate in the summer festival spread. The atmosphere of the class suddenly changed. Everyone threw their workbook away and started discussing what their class would do in the summer festival.\u201cI heard from the people in the international class that they want to sell coffee. Someone would bring their coffee machine!\u201d\u201cNice. They thought it well.\u201dBut Chu Yin thought differently. Even if people would want to drink iced coffee in the summer, might as well buy a beer or a watermelon.Song Zhaolin had the same plan: \u201c\u2013or let\u2019s sell watermelons!\u201dEveryone in the class immediately scolded him:\u201cInsane! Are you gonna carry all those watermelons?\u201d\u201cWatermelon can\u2019t make much money at all!\u201dSong Zhaolin miserably closed his mouth.Han Chuying came to visit Chu Yin after class. She was excited when she heard that Chu Yin was going to participate.She and Zhao Qingyao had a lot of good ideas. If Chu Yin would be participating at the booth \u2013 there would be so many things they could do, okay!They could make a fortune by taking photos with people! Or\u2026turn the whole stall into a small bar! They could see all kinds of fresh and cool summer drinks, secretly mixing little alcohol! Chu Yin could sing in that bar! What a good idea!!With her goddess\u2019 face, the rewards must be smashing.\u00a0 Chu Yin could make more money!\u201cI think it\u2019s okay?\u201d\u201cHahaha, Han Chuying, are you an undercover for Class 5?\u201dAll the students in Class 5 agreed with the plan except for Fu Mingxuan, who thought the idea was too focused on Chu Yin. Everyone was supportive so Fu Mingxuan\u2019s protest wasn\u2019t heard.Han Chuying was excited before she suddenly realized a problem. She turned her head and asked Chu Yin: \u201cYin Yin, can you sing?\u201dChu Yin had always been famous for her crushing achievements and beautiful face. Including the last art festival, she didn\u2019t show any talents.This\u2026 In case she didn\u2019t know how to sing, it was fine Chu Yin could attract visitors by just sitting in the booth.Chu Yin thought for a while and then asked tentatively, \u201cThen\u2026can I play the guitar?\u201dHan Chuying blinked.Everyone looked at her.Chu Yin immediately said, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it fits the atmosphere, but playing this accompaniment is more comfortable\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, it can. This is also a good idea!\u201dHan Chuying almost yelled out \u2013 \u201cSo surprsign! Chu Yin can even play the guitar!!\u201dShe immediately decided that she must prepare a high chair for Class 5! When the summer festival comes, Chu Yin would sit on top of the high chair with her two long legs and with guitar in her hand!The people in Class 5 didn\u2019t know that Chu Yin could play the guitar. After they discovered this new revelation, they became more enthusiastic about the planning of the summer festival.They could feel that their class could win the championship!in the end, Class 5 decided to make a bar counter, selling sparkling water, lemonade, carbonated drinks, and other beverages suitable for summer. They placed a small stage with a high chair positioned in the center.This stall was divided into two parts, one part was for selling drinks, the other was for ordering songs \u2013 they were simply genius hahaha!Chu Yin was very interested in this profitable activity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since the client was truly satisfied, the final payment was immediately wired to her. Chu Yin\u2019s bank account increased by tens of thousand and she felt more at ease.Achievements and money were things that reassure people. Chu Yin would do her best. In the past few days, she had been playing the guitar and learning scores of popular songs.Huiwen had never been stingy in activities. Each class was assigned model materials for \u201cbuilding a stall\u201d.The students started decorating their stalls.However, the boys in Class 5 were very attentive on the small stage. The music stand was organized \u2013 after all, this was likely to become the highlight of the festival!On the day of the summer festival, the entire Huiwen Middle School was very excited.Han Chuying carried her DSLR and cell phone as she went into the stall of Class 5.Chu Yin tightened the guitar string and looked at Han Chuying: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be so grand, right?\u201dHan Chuying: \u201cWhichever you prefer\u201dEven if Chu Yin didn\u2019t sing, there would still be people paying.Chu Yin sat on the high chair and held the guitar in her arms.Han Chuying had begun to make pink bubbles.It was hot today. Chu Yin wore an ordinary loose white shirt and a pair of washed ripped blue jeans \u2013 her style was completely different from when she wore school uniforms!Chu Yin looked handsome and beautiful in her outfit. Her head was lowered as she held the guitar, her eyelashes looked focused and affectionate.Han Chuying: I did it again!!!The summer festival would only take part in the first grade and second grade, with more than twenty booths.When the festival started, the classes were excited and began to shout to attract guests.Some classes took the lead in attracting the first wave of visitors. For example, Hao Diao\u2019s class made boys wear revealing clothes that show their breasts.Chu Yin was not in a hurry as she held the guitar to play.Someone posted in the online forum:[Damn, Sister Yin so beautiful][Miss Sister is so handsome!!][Want to listen to her singing!]Song Zhaolin went out for a long walk before returning to his class. He went to Chu Yin and told her the school\u2019s summer festival layout.\u201cSister Yin, I saw your sister just now.\u201dChu Yin raised an eyebrow: \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cShe seems to be doing well? Wearing gold and silver,\u201d Song Zhaolin said, \u201cShe was upset thinking that you were singing here for money.\u201dChu Yin said, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I also saw your brother and Gu Qiuze. They came to join in the fun but Chu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t speak to them. Your family relationship is so complicated.\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s gold and silver must not have been given by the Chu family. No matter what means she used, it had nothing to do with Chu Yin anyway. But if her brother would come over later, she would pour them a drinkSong Zhaolin soon forgot about Chu Qiuqiu, because many people noticed Chu Yin with guitar in her arms.\u201cScan the code to order a song?\u201d\u201cAh, can I listen to xxx!\u201dThe small bar in Class 5 suddenly became lively.When Chu Yin received the first order, she was excited.She cleared her throat, swept a chord, and started to sing gently with her guitar.The more she sang, the more people came to the entrance.When Chu Yin\u2019s song ended, the crowd cheered frantically.\u201cHer singing skill is so nice?!\u201d\u201cIt feels so good to the ears~\u201d[Are there any more songs!! ][Ahhhhh, I still want to hear it!!!]Jiang Yan was in charge of collecting money, and her mobile phone began to ring the sound of \u201cXXX yuan arrived\u201d, and the drinks were selling fast.Song Zhaolin took out his mobile phone and recorded a video and sent it to his friends happily.[Business is booming, many people came to support!]When Lu Zhen received it, he was sitting in the office with documents in his hand.He clicked on it at random and saw Chu Yin sitting there holding the guitar in the middle of the crowd.The video was very noisy. He couldn\u2019t hear what she said, but she smiled beautifully.Lu Zhen stared at the phone for a while, watched the short video several times, and then turned off the phone.Looking down at the file on the desktop again, he suddenly couldn\u2019t focus.Lu Zhen forced himself to finish reading the documents in his hand, and then suddenly put down his pen.He opened the door of the office and walked out.\u201cYoung Master?\u201d The assistant stood up in surprise.Lu Zhen held out his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll go out.\u201dWith that, he strode away faster.He wanted to see the summer festival.When Lu Zhen arrived at school, the busiest time in the morning had passed.Chu Yin was not at the booth of Class 5. Lu Zhen walked around and finally found herShe stood in the grass area, raising her head as she talked to Gu Qiuze.Lu Zhen watched them in silence for a while, waiting for his heartbeat to slow down a little bit.Chu Yin sang five or six songs in the morning. The sales of drinks in the stall were good. Han Chuying said the profit from the live performance was also very impressive.She was happy she made money. So when Chu Shi and Gu Qiuze came over, Chu Yin invited them to drink.While her brother went to buy food, she and Gu Qiuze chatted for a whileThe University Gu Qiuze applied for had been finalized, which was not far away from the school Chu Yin stayed in last life. Gu Qiuze was a well-planned person. Although he did not take part in the college entrance examination, he could also make some suggestions on Chu Yin\u2019s studies.After talking for a while, a loud noise came from the direction Chu Shi had left.It seemed to be a girl crying and was vaguely mixed with a middle-aged woman\u2019s sharp voice. Gu Qiuze looked over and frowned, \u201cI\u2019ll go and have a look. You can wait for your brother to come back.\u201dChu Yin sipped her lemonade as she nodded: \u201cOkay.\u201dShe stood under the shade of the tree, moistened her throat with lemonade, and closed her eyes as she leaned against the tree for a while.Within a few seconds, a shadow cast before her eyes.Chu Yin opened her eyes and was faced with Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes. He seemed to have something to say.\u201c?\u201dLu Zhen was very anxious after seeing Gu Qiuze.Even if he was trying to shorten the process, could he wait?He wanted to try and explain. Just\u2026 try again.\u201cChu Yin, actually I\u2026\u201dBut when Lu Zhen tried to say a word, the familiar harsh sound suddenly sounded in his mind. The terrifying headache hit immediately. It was tearing his nerves and making his eyes chaotic.HIs throat tasted fishy and sweet. He was silenced, unable to speak a word.Those words were taboo. Because he was unable to speak, he could only do his best not to get out of control.Sure enough, he couldn\u2019t escape the rules of the world.No one could change his fate.Lu Zhen\u2019s figure shook slightly, his face pale as he stood in front of the tree trunk.Chu Yin was taken aback.Lu Zhen closed his eyes while standing at a safe distance from Chu Yin.Chu Yin pressed her back against the tree trunk and saw Lu Zhen\u2019s dead-like face.After a long time, Chu Yin kicked him: \u201cHey\u2026are you okay?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s tight lips turned blue.At this moment, Chu Yin thought:\u00a0He\u2019s not doing well either.Whether it was in the previous life or in this life, even if he had everything, a happy look seemed to seldom appear on his face.At this time, it was almost lifeless.Chu Yin raised the little worry in her heart and kicked him again: \u201c\u2026Lu Zhen?\u201dAfter a long time, Lu Zhen slowly opened his eyes. His pupils were slightly moist.He slowly let go of his hand and stretched a little further.Chu Yin breathed a sigh of relief, with a bad tone: \u201cI thought you were dead.\u201dShe was fierce.Lu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes flicked, not knowing why, but a trace of long-lost joy appeared in his heart.Maybe he was becoming crazy? Even if she would just tell not to die, Lu Zhen would still taste a touch of sweetness from the endless bitterness and despair he was in.Chu Yin frowned, watching Lu Zhen\u2019s pale face and sweat on his forehead.Is he having a heatstroke?Well, looking at the miserable look of the dog man, she would show mercy once.\u201cStretch out your hand.\u201d Her voice was clear.Lu Zhen was startled.After a few seconds, he slowly stretched out his hand, his fingertips trembling slightly.The pain was fading as peace and tranquility slowly overtook him.The misery of the past faded away at this moment, turning into a warm wind, bypassing Lu Zhen\u2019s fingertips.Chu Yin touched the pocket of her trousers, took out a blue candy paper mint, and gently placed it in his palm.\u201cEat this.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His hand floated mid-air, forgetting to move.He mumbled in disbelief. \u201cFor\u2026me?\u201dHe had just suffered a period of torment, so his voice was low and hoarse at this time. It sounded so sickly.Chu Yin was embarrassed as the candy was just a cheap mint. The pampered young master wouldn\u2019t have had this kind of candy in his entire life.Chu Yin raised her hand again, intending to take the candy back: \u201cForget it.\u201dLu Zhen finally reacted. Before she could snatch it back, he immediately folded his palms and held the mint candy.\u201cSince you gave it to me, it\u2019s mine now.\u201dChu Yin stared at him with her black and bright peach blossom eyes, thinking that Lu Zhen was like a capricious and naive child.The dog man in this life was still young. He was not as mature and knowledgeable as he was in his previous life.She was more concerned about what Lu Zhen was about to say.\u201cSo? What were you going to say?\u201d Chu Yin raised her eyes, to look\u00a0 at the person in front of her, and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201dChu Yin knew him so well. She realized that what Lu Zhen had been about to say wasn\u2019t normal.There were no expectations or anything in his eyes that belonged to a young man, but\u2026this aura, made her feel familiar.Lu Zhen in her last life looked at her like this, many times.He wanted to talk but at the same time, he wouldn\u2019t. Chu Yin hadn\u2019t understood Lu Zhen\u2019s sad expression back in her previous life. She didn\u2019t even care about him at all.But now, 17-year-old Lu Zhen also showed such a look.The desire to want to talk showed in his face again.So? what was it that you wanted to say?Lu Zhen\u2019s jaw tightened for a moment before his thick black eyelashes lowered: \u201cSorry.\u201dChu Yin was a little disappointed. She snorted coldly, \u201cDo you know that\u00a0 you\u2019ll be beaten to death if you leave someone hanging?\u201dShe cursed directly at his face.It must have been in Lu Zhen\u2019s genes to take pleasure in abuse since his lips curled after listening to it, \u201cThen beat me to death.\u201dChu Yin indifferently said: \u201cI want to go to college. I don\u2019t want to go to jail yet.\u201dLu Zhen smiled.Seeing that she didn\u2019t plan to take the candy back, Lu Zhen carefully put the mint candy into the pocket of his pants.It was like putting his panicked heart away.Although everything was uncertain in this life, he believed that there was a possibility to change the ending of this life.Plus\u2026she gave him candy. He suddenly gained more courage.\u201cThen study hard,\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes lowered. He softly asked after a moment, \u201cChu Yin, do you plan to take the Q test?\u201dBecause he casually asked her, Chu Yin didn\u2019t realize the bigger meaning in his words. She subconsciously replied, \u201cQ is a big university. Why do I want to attend a college for science and engineering?\u201dShe didn\u2019t care about Wei Heming.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart warmed. As if nothing had happened, he continued to ask, \u201cWhat about going abroad? Do you plan on it?\u201dChu Yin looked at him in surprise and wondered why Lu Zhen still cared about her studies: \u201cFor the time being, no.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes lightly moved. There was a fine joy in his heart.Chu Yin raised her eyes. After hesitating for a few seconds, she said, \u201cLu Zhen, go and have a snack too.\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t have the time to think deeply about many things, Lu Zhen\u2019s pervert uncle was surely not good.Lu Zhen was a dog, but she also didn\u2019t want to see a disgusting person like Lu Linyuan freely walking around.Lu Zhen was slightly startled, then his lips widened with a smile. \u201cOkay.\u201dMy heart will always beat for you.\u2026Gu Qiuze didn\u2019t need to take too much effort to look for Chu Shi because he was standing in the noisiest part of the crowd. He could see him at a glance.It was originally broken time. There were not as many people as there were just now, but there were still a lot of people gathered in the central square surrounded by the small stalls, surrounding the two women in the middle.One was Chu Qiuqiu with messy clothes, and the other was a fierce but luxurious wife.Chu Shi rushed and pulled Chu Qiuqiu behind him and stood in front of the luxurious wife.This failed to calm the anger of the other party. She pointed at Chu Shi and cursed: \u201cYou, Chu family,\u00a0 are such shameless animals?! Just because you went bankrupt, you\u00a0 seduce someone else\u2019s husband. To think you\u2019re still underage? Ah!\u201dHer words were clear. The crowd watching this scene was in an uproar.Damn it! A third party??Chu Qiuqiu?!! Wasn\u2019t this exciting!Chu Shi\u2019s face was ugly. He was treated as a young master since he was a child. This was the first time he\u2019s gotten scolded by someone like this.However, Chu Qiuqiu was still his sister. He couldn\u2019t leave her alone.Chu Qiuqiu was already panicking, feeling the eyes of the students.She thought bitterly\u2014how could this old woman come to the school directly, just to harm her intentionally!She only came to school with her newly acquired necklace and bag.\u00a0 She\u2019d wanted to show it off, but because of this vicious old woman, she was humiliated! If those boys hadn\u2019t ignored her, would she even have time to hang out with a middle-aged uncle?!She and Mr. Li didn\u2019t do anything. They only ate a few meals and strolled in the street a few times! She didn\u2019t take the initiative! Just because this old woman couldn\u2019t get her husband\u2019s time,\u00a0 she\u2019d go and blame her?!Chu Qiuqiu wanted to scold Mrs. Li to death, but she showed a soft and weak face. She hid behind Chu Shi: \u201cAuntie, did you find the wrong person?\u201dHer attitude and language completely angered the opposite person.What women hated most was the \u2018weak\u2019 white lotus. Plus, her word \u201cauntie\u201d directly fueled Mrs. Li\u2019s anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The price is fifty thousand seven!\u201dChu Shi pressed her arm: \u201cPlease calm down first.\u201dMrs. Li pushed him away: \u201cCan I still calm down after knowing this?!\u201dShe then pulled the leather bag on Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s elbow: \u201cG\u2019s snakeskin bag! You thought he bought it for you? That was stolen from my cabinet! \u2014 I know it\u00a0 because there\u2019s a scratch on the strap. Even if I don\u2019t need it, I can\u2019t allow little animals to take advantage of it!\u201dThe words were sharp knives.Chu Shi\u2019s expression was so ugly that he couldn\u2019t describe it. He didn\u2019t expect that Chu Qiuqiu would be so eager to go down the quick success of instant benefits.Chu Qiuqiu shook her head crazily. Mrs. Li simply began to tear her clothes: \u201cHe bought this shirt too? Okay! I\u2019ll make you run naked today!\u201dChu Qiuqiu was completely frightened: \u201cBrother! Brother, save me! Brother!\u201dChu Shi closed his eyes, then pulled the crazy Mrs. Li away. He coldly said to Chu Qiuqiu, \u201cReturn those things.\u201dChu Qiuqiu still wanted to quibble: \u201cI\u2026I didn\u2019t!\u201dChu Shi whispered: \u201cShut up!\u201dChu Qiuqiu was startled. She reluctantly handed over the necklace and bag.Chu Shi turned to Mrs. Li: \u201cShe will return the rest later. The Chu family has no intention of covering up. If she can\u2019t return it to you, she will be at your disposal.\u201dChu Qiuqiu couldn\u2019t believe it: \u201cBrother?!\u201dMrs. Li\u2019s anger finally calmed down. She looked at Chu Shi with more appreciation. After thinking about it for two seconds, she didn\u2019t feel like offending the young man, so she turned and walked away.The people who were eating melon seeds quickly dispersed and went to spread the event in the forum.Chu Qiuqiu abruptly hugged Chu Shi\u2019s arm: \u201cBrother, don\u2019t you care about me? Me and Mr. Li are really nothing!\u201dChu Shi glanced at her coldly, then took her hand off: \u201cYou don\u2019t value the Chu Family anymore. Today, I protected you from being humiliated in the public. This is the last time I will take care of you since you will have to take care of yourself in the future. \u201c\u201cAfter all, you aren\u2019t my biological sister either.\u201dChu Qiuqiu felt like she was struck by lightning.After Chu Shi finished speaking, he walked to Gu Qiuze who was waiting in the distance. The two were left side by side.Chu Qiuqiu stood alone, listening to the faint laughter of the people around her.\u201cLet\u2019s go to Class 5! Chu Yin will be there!\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s run over! Let\u2019s see if we can pick a song!\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m rushing!\u201d\u201cAh, wait for me!!\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s mentality collapsed\u2014why?Why did her brother only recognize Chu Yin as his younger sister? And why was Chu Yin the one sought after by everyone?Why should she (CQ) be despised by others just because she wanted a bag?!Why did her life become a mess after her family went bankrupt? But Chu Yin wasn\u2019t affected at all?!The Chu Yin you are all worshipping is the real country bumpkin! Has everyone forgotten?!Chu Qiuqiu squeezed her loose clothes tightly, her face gradually distorted and became hideous \u2013 if they had forgotten, then she would make them remember!As Chu Qiuqiu fixed her clothes, she walked to the corner with no one around.There was a call that she hadn\u2019t made for a long time. It came in handy this time.After the call was connected, the familiar and flattering voice of Chu Qiuqiu could be heard: \u201cOh. This is Miss Chu.\u201dThe news of the Chu family\u2019s bankruptcy hadn\u2019t reached the countryside yet. In front of this poor man, Chu Qiuqiu hid it well. \u201cI will reimburse the round-trip ticket! I will reward you again after the incident!\u201dThe other party was immediately happy. \u201cNo problem, Miss!\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t know about the drama that took place at noon. She went straight back to the booth in the afternoon and continued to work at her post.After a whole morning of people talking, the whole school now knew that they could pick songs in the small bar of Class 5. Plus, the campus goddess would be singing for them while holding the guitar!So at the beginning of the afternoon session, the small bar of Class 5 was full of people.Most of the waiters were busy. Empty soda bottles were all over the floor.Han Chuying occupied the closest seat to Chu Yin\u2019s high chair.She said to Zhang Luo: \u201cMultiple people can order the same song! Songs with the largest order will be sung first!\u201dChu Yin was shocked:\u00a0Isn\u2019t she cheating money by making them order songs so many times?!Han Chuying shook her head, winking eyebrows. She leaned in to whisper: \u201cThe live performance is like this. Don\u2019t think it is inappropriate. Look, the audience is happy!\u201dSure enough, the students outside were very excited as they talked about it. Which song would they raise their funds for?Han Chuying was very happy to see the result. Jiang Yan couldn\u2019t even record the money transactions for this live performance.A few minutes later, the most ordered song came out. Chu Yin took a look at it.Joyce Chu \u2013 \u201cMiss You\u201d.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dAre you sure you want to hear this..!!!\u201cI paid for this song three times!\u201d\u201cI want to listen to this too, ah!\u201dThe song style was simple. Although people could learn this easily, the singing style of the song was not consistent with Chu Yin\u2019s voice.In the morning, Chu Yin sang two Chinese slow songs and two English songs.She didn\u2019t know how to sing this kind of style.Han Chuying suddenly regretted her actions. She quietly asked Chu Yin: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we change the song, the second one is rock and roll\u2026\u201dChu Yin waved her hand.\u201cI miss you so much\u201d has a super high number of points.Since they collected money from these students, they couldn\u2019t trick them.Chu Yin cleared her throat, swiped her fingers, and swept a chord. She also made psychological preparations before starting\u00a0 her performance.The audience calmed down immediately, and stared\u00a0 at Chu Yin with piercing eyes.Chu Yin licked her lips, enduring the trace of\u00a0 embarrassment. She slightly squeezed her throat and sang, \u201cI want to\u2014\u201dThe finger swept down, and the guitar\u2019s bright rhythm sounded.The girl\u2019s sweet voice then matched: \u201c\u2014\u2014Send a text message to you, I miss you so much. I want to call you immediately, I miss you so much\u2026\u201dWhen she sang a normal lyrical song, her voice was very textured, light, and charming. But when she sang this sweet song, the natural rhythm in her voice was brought out, and it revealed her tenderness.Chu Yin\u2019s white and slender fingers flicked on the strings as her head swayed slightly. The more she sang, the easier it was. Her sweet voice scratched people\u2019s ears.Han Chuying covered her mouth and held Song Zhaolin\u2019s mobile phone, her hand shaking slightly.\u201cHelp ahhhhhh! Too cute and too sweet!!!!!!!\u201dIf she could turn into an emoticon, her face would be blurred from all the shaking.Not only her, but the students at the scene were also about to pass out.When Chu Yin sang the last note, the crowd suddenly burst into strong cheers.\u201cSister Yin! You are our idol in this world.\u201d\u201cQuickly! what is the next song?\u201d\u201c?\u201d Chu Yin raised her hand, \u201cWait\u2014\u201dA few minutes later, Han Chuying smiled and held up the list.SweetI\u2019m Super SweetLearn to MeowHeartbeatChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dThe summer festival was over. The bills of each class were submitted. Class 2 and Class 5 were honorably elected as the highest turnover class for the summer festival.There were two highlights of this festival. All of these centered around the Chu sisters. First was Chu Yin\u2019s live performance. The second was Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s public incident.Chu Yin only knew of this after Song Zhaolin talked about it. She now understood why her brother had left the festival early.\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin thought silently, \u201cChu Qiuqiu didn\u2019t succeed. The lock with Chen Xuanyuan didn\u2019t work.\u201dIt was a pleasant failure.In the end, the summer festival turnover was owned by the class. Class 5 discussed the division of the money because the live performance segment was completely done by Chu Yin.It would be super tiring to sing dozens of songs a day, so the income from the song was given to Chu Yin.No one objected.Chu Yin\u2019s rebuttal was ignored, so she decided to take out a portion of the money and invite the whole class to milk tea.Song Zhaolin drank two cups alone, which made him happy.There were still thousands of dollars left so Chu Yin deposited all of them in a card. The small increase in deposits made her feel at ease.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although they were still a distance away from the college entrance examination, Huiwen\u2019s tutoring class had a special task \u2013\u00a0 to use the college entrance examination paper as a mock exam.Chu Yin felt very excited. Although she passed the college entrance examination in her previous life, she was not the same as she was before.The money earned from the summer festival would be used to buy new workbooks. This week, she bought a lot of exercises and simulation papers.Wei Heming had signed a contract so he didn\u2019t need to take the college entrance examination.After hearing that they were going to simulate the college entrance examination, he enthusiastically offered to help Chu Yin in math.Although it was touching, Chu Yin still refused.On a very hot afternoon, just after the school bell rang, the students left in twos and threes.Chu Yin didn\u2019t move and continued to sit in the classroom to study.Song Zhaolin pulled up his bag and asked her, \u201cSister Yin, do you want to eat together?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cNo.\u201dSong Zhaolin didn\u2019t bother her any longer and flung the bag on his back and bounced away.Brother Zhen recently finished a big project. His brother Zhen was so awesome that he directly came to school without any rest! Song Zhaolin guessed that he must have missed his friends.It was difficult to meet him, so he\u2019d have a meal together with him this time!\u201cThen I\u2019ll go now!\u201d\u201cGo.\u201dChu Yan didn\u2019t hear the events that were happening outside the window and answered the questions quietly. But not long after, someone rushed in to break the peace.\u201cChu Yin!\u201d the classmate said breathlessly, \u201cThere\u2019s someone looking for you at the school gate!\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows.Looking for me? Who?It didn\u2019t seem to be good since the classmate was hesitant to speak.\u2026At the school gate.The two middle-aged adults dressed as migrant workers stood outside the gate, a man and a woman, each with a louder voice.\u201cI\u2019m looking for Chu Yin! Chu Yin! Isn\u2019t she in this school?!\u201dThe guard went up to them and informed them: \u201cPlease lower your voice.\u201d\u201cWhy do we have to lower our voice? Us? Should we find our daughter secretly?!\u201dChu Qiuqiu hid from the crowd, triumphantly looking at the two people at the gate.What a good idea she thought! The parents of Chu Yin from the countryside were invited to show the noble students of Huiwen the appearance of the poor people.Let\u2019s see how poor your goddess is!Chu Qiuqiu lost her face in front of the whole school. Don\u2019t think Chu Yin could get away with not being shamed either!\u201cFuck, these are Chu Yin\u2019s parents?\u201d\u201cNo, isn\u2019t her family a wealthy family? Although they went bankrupt, it shouldn\u2019t be like this\u2026\u201d\u201cI remember, Chu Yin\u2019s family is from the countryside! Yes, then this is hers\u2026\u201dWhen Chu Yin walked to the school gate, the old couple had already started acting.\u201cWe are heartbroken! After being adopted by a wealthy family,\u00a0 she\u2019s ignored her parents who raised her for more than ten years?\u201d\u201cClassmates, if it weren\u2019t for us, she might have starved to death in the fields long ago!\u201d\u201cAnd because of her beauty, she\u2019s been playing\u00a0 with many men! We can\u2019t hold our heads up.\u201dChu Yin closed her eyes.She hadn\u2019t seen them since she entered her second life. These two old people should have taken a lot of money from the Chu family and spend all of it on their stupid son. Chu Yin didn\u2019t need to know who called them here. Sometimes, she had to admire Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s imagination.She tapped on the system: \u201cUnlock the script.\u201dXueji had been quiet for a while recently. She didn\u2019t know what was wrong.The script opened up automatically opened in front of her.\u3010Although their first time coming to the big city was rushed, the two members of the Wang family spared no effort to spread rumors to get\u00a0 money. The more unbearable Chu Yin would feel, the more satisfied Chu Qiuqiu was.\u3011\u201cAh! Chu Yin! Is that you? Did everyone see how she ignored us? Do you think you\u2019re losing face when you\u2019re with us?\u201d They shouted.Students immediately looked over.Chu Qiuqiu smiled happily \u2014 experience the feeling of being stared at by people!Chu Yin saw that many people were looking forward to her explanation since these two people have been shouting and describing Chu Yin very unbearably.For these kinds of people, Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to say one word at all.She grabbed the light pen and changed \u201crumors\u201d to \u201cself-destruction.\u201dIf she was the same person as in her last life, she would\u2019ve been ashamed to stand in front of everyone because of her inferiority.However, This rubbish method couldn\u2019t destroy her now.Seeing her indifferent expression, the mother simply sat on the ground and cried: \u201cOh my God! We came all the way to your school to\u2026\u201dChu Yin waited for her to finish her words when suddenly a wind swept over her side.Then someone pressed a baseball cap on her head, blocking all vision and gaze.Lu Zhen pressed down the brim of his hat, shook his right hand,\u00a0 and walked towards the two people.Even if he came too late and only heard the last few words, he planned to throw them straight into the trash can.At this moment, the woman from the village said as she sat on the ground, \u201c\u2014\u2014It\u2019s just for the money!\u201dLu Zhen paused.The people around were also stunned.The mother\u2019s face was a bit weird, but she couldn\u2019t control her mouth from spilling the truth. \u201cWho would even remember this pathetic girl! If it wasn\u2019t for the money, why would\u00a0 we come all\u00a0 this way to do this ? For free ?\u201dThe father beside her also echoed: \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Miss Chu Qiuqiu, providing for the ticket reimbursement and rewards, we\u00a0 wouldn\u2019t have come!\u201dThe crowd was suddenly in an uproar\u2013Chu Qiuqiu?! She asked people to specifically smear Chu Yin?!Lu Zhen frowned and looked at their expressions carefully, but a strange light gradually appeared in his black eyes.It\u2019s not under their control\u2026?Then\u2026 Who controls them?The mother couldn\u2019t stop at all: \u201cShe was found by the Chu family back then. Alas, we were so happy that this pathetic girl finally had left. The Chu family can still continue to give us money!\u201d\u201cWe need money this time for my son\u2019s wedding room!!\u201d\u201cYes! Yes!\u201dThe students of Huiwen were very simple. It was the first time that they had seen such harsh people.Thinking of their treatment of Chu Yin, the students got angry.Song Zhaolin rushed to the front: \u201cYou fools! Do you not know you\u2019re being disgusting?!\u201dMother: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?!\u201dThe scene escalated directly into a scolding battle, with dozens of mouths cursing two people at the same time.Chu Yin glanced at Lu Zhen\u2019s back, then pressed down the brim of his hat.She slipped into the crowd, left the noisy school gate, and walked quietly to the classroom next to the wall.Not long after, footsteps sounded behind her.Chu Yin knew who it was. She turned around while taking off his hat, \u201cThank you\u2013\u201cBefore she could finish her sentence, a warm breath touched her face. Lu Zhen grabbed her wrist and gently pressed it against the wall.Chu Yin was forced to lean against the wall.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s breathing was a little disordered.As he was thinking of a theory, his brain became confused.He originally thought that Chu Yin might have some power to influence things around her, such as the basketball and glass doors.But today, he puzzled out all the pieces.A long time ago, he was forced to say the word \u2018roll\u2019 on the rooftop.Chen Xuanyuan\u2019s uncontrollable loud voice at the banquet.Gu Qiuze\u2019s sudden change of attitude in the Winter Camp.Human speech and behavior\u2026She could control it.Lu Zhen\u2019s heartbeat was rapid. His blood was boiling.Do you have control of this world?A hidden dark line tightened. He had a feeling.Only after\u00a0 living for two lifetimes was he\u00a0 able to understand \u2018destiny\u2019Lu Zhen gasped while looking down at\u00a0 Chu Yin\u2019s face.If the dark logic coincides with you and me,If this was a cause and effect,Being imprisoned under the boundless world\u2019s rules,You are the only way\u2026For me to breathe.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He could feel the beating of her heart.Because he was in a hurry, Lu Zhen\u2019s black hair was slightly disordered. His pupils were shimmering in his expressionless face of his.Chu Yin saw herself from his eyes.Her heart began to beat faster\u2026She had a vague feeling that Lu Zhen finally found out!He had already hinted last time when she made the light lamp fall. And now he happened to see it again. Everything happened too \u2018coincidentally\u2019. He would surely guess that a mastermind was behind all of this.Chu Yin bit the tip of her tongue. She decided, with no hesitation, that no matter what Lu Zhen had found out, she wouldn\u2019t answer him!Especially the things she did to him before!!Lu Zhen gasped, his breath gently brushing her cheek. The girl\u2019s face was porcelain-white and her eyelashes were distinct. He could guess what she was thinking by look at her.He lowered his voice as he softly asked, secretly hoping, \u201cChu Yin, is it you?\u201dChu Yin subconsciously wanted to say \u2018No\u201d, but then realized that this question was concealing the meaning.The correct answer should be: \u201cWhat do you mean by me?\u201dAfter she asked, the corners of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips curled up. His head lowered as he whispered to her, \u201cDo you have? Super powers?\u201dChu Yin\u2019s head buzzed \u2013 the dog man had guessed it!Chu Yin\u2019s heart began to beat again. Since Lu Zhen already found out, she couldn\u2019t use the script at this moment. It was useless. She couldn\u2019t change his mind.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know how many incidents that Lu Zhen found out that she messed with.The situation was a bit awkward.\u00a0What if you realized that a stranger had been messing with you since the first meeting?\u00a0He would obviously want to know why. Were there any grudges between strangers?Lu Zhen wouldn\u2019t know the reasons why.Chu Yin, the old script artist, had been changing it for almost a year now. At this instant, she was feeling a guilty conscience in front of the biggest victim.She shrank her shoulders back, her black eyes didn\u2019t evade him: \u201cSuper powers? I have them. Is being good at learning one of them?\u201dLu Zhen smiled lightly.He subconsciously rubbed Chu Yin\u2019s wrist bones. For a moment, he wanted to kiss those eyes gently as he did in his previous life.But he knew it was not possible. The longing suppressed for too long made his spine slightly numb.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, let go of the hand that held her, and stepped back.He didn\u2019t need to ask anymore. He already had the answer.Although Lu Zhen didn\u2019t know how she did it. He knew she could control people\u2019s behavior in some way.Unbelievable.But Lu Zhen knew what kind of world this world was, so it was not difficult to understand.He realized that his life was in her hands.He believed that the connection between him and Chu Yin was not over yet.Lu Zhen felt a sense of peace from her. He knew that someone in this world could save him. Even if that person wanted to kill him, he could safely die in her hands.Chu Yin suspiciously looked at him.Lu Zhen took the baseball cap in her hand and placed it on her head again. He gently pulled the messy hairs behind her ears.Chu Yin was numbed.Lu Zhen had politely retracted his hand back, the warm touch between them still lingered in his heart. \u201cI\u2019m giving it to you.\u201dChu Yin raised the brim of his hat, looked at him, and said, \u201cwhy?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cFor the mint candy.\u201dAlthough he wasn\u2019t willing to eat it yet.Chu Yin was a bit surprised that Lu Zhen didn\u2019t dwell on the issue of \u2018superpowers\u2019. Was it because he hadn\u2019t realized yet that she ruined him a lot of times with it?If he didn\u2019t delve into it, then neither would she.Lu Zhen glanced at her one last time, touched the top of Chu Yin\u2019s hat, and said, \u201cGo and use your learning superpower.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dThis conversation sounded normal, but it seemed\u2026everything was different again.Lu Zhen watched Chu Yin walk away calmly.Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to expose herself. Similarly, Lu Zhen didn\u2019t tell her that he remembered everything.He would reveal everything at the right time when she would no longer be in danger.Asking her\u2026\u201dDo you want me in this life?\u201d I\u2019m forever yours.Lu Zhen looked at Chu Yin\u2019s back and suddenly felt happy.How lucky is he in this life?There\u2019s still a chance\u2026Due to the crazy self-destructive incident of the two members of the Wang family, it completely turned into a farce.The students of Huiwen were filled with righteous indignation. They all felt distressed for Chu Yin \u2013 it was enough to be separated and fell into this kind of family. Now, this pair of adoptive parents had the nerve to come and slander her for money. Disgusting!Hao Diao was at the school gate at that time. He never feared anyone so he led a group of students and scolded them.The scene became more chaotic as the incident escalated. The parents were directly sent to the police station.The initiator of the event was, of course, not forgotten.The process of how Chu Qiuqiu ordered them was reported. She was caught escaping in the parking lot.\u201cIt\u2019s not me! This has nothing to do with me! If I ordered them, how could they rat me out?!\u201d Chu Qiuqiu yelled, not caring of her image, \u201cI am framed!\u201dHao Diao scolded her back. \u201cDo you think we\u2019ll believe that they burst here on their own? Don\u2019t wash your hands clean. It\u2019s nauseous!\u201dHe pinched his nose, showing a vomiting motion.Chu Qiuqiu almost fainted in anger.Everyone in the police station knew her well. \u201cLittle girl, have you had a very rich life?\u201dChu Qiuqiu ignored them with a cold face.Because there was no physical fight involved, the police couldn\u2019t charge them.Not long after, The Chu family came to pick up Chu Qiuqiu. Hao Diao and the rest of the students left as well.After they all left, the police station suddenly received a call from the city bureau. The director personally answered the call and respectfully responded.\u201cWell, policemen comrades, since the issue is resolve\u2026\u201d The Wang parents said.\u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d The director walked over with a serious face and stood in front of the two of them. \u201cWe received news that you two are suspected of human trafficking. You are to stay here to continue the investigation! \u201cTheir faces were completely white.\u2026Chu Qiuqiu returned to the Chu family and saw her parents, she wanted to complain.\u201cMom and Dad, I\u2014\u201dBefore she could finish her words, she was slapped.\u201cShut up! \u201cChu Qiuqiu was beaten hard that she almost flew out. She clutched her red and swollen face in disbelief.Father Chu: \u201cDon\u2019t you think you embarrassed me enough?! You also ordered those farmers to come to school to make trouble. Do you want others to know of Chu Yin\u2019s background? She is my biological daughter! What about you? Have you forgotten where you came from?\u201dChu Qiuqiu was directly hit in her most secret sore spot and cried out, \u201cI am also the daughter of the Chu family\u2026\u201dFather Chu said, \u201cWhat the hell are you saying? Even marriage can\u2019t keep a man\u2019s heart, Chen Xuanyuan has no interest in you! Since you went out and hook up with Mr. Li, you deliberately want to destroy the Chu family!\u201d\u201cNo, no!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t attend this school anymore. The procedures for Huiwen have already been completed. You will be transferred to an ordinary middle school tomorrow!\u201dChu Qiuqiu\u2019s eyes went big, \u201cDad!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call me that!\u201d Father Chu slammed the formalities directly on her face, \u201cThis family won\u2019t pay you this tuition. Go to the ordinary school by yourself!\u201dChu Qiuqiu collapsed completely.\u2026Later, some rumors spread that Chu Qiuqiu\u2019s real name was Wang Xiaoyan.She and Chu Yin were not real sisters. She was only adopted by the Chu Family!\u201cDamn. I had this hunch before!\u201d\u201cAn adopted daughter pretending to be the real daughter?\u201d\u201cSo why is she making trouble for Chu Yin? Wang Xiaoyan hahaha!\u201d\u2026\u201cXiaoyan has transferred to another school. Please don\u2019t talk about it any more!\u201d\u201cHahahahaha!\u201dThis incident deeply pleased Liang Yueqi and Fu Mingxuan. The two of them made complaints in the forum together, laughing at Wang Xiaoyan. After all, she was one of their rivals.Neither Liang Yueqi nor Liang Yueqi wanted to give up Lu Zhen.Their competitiveness was still the same. They originally suspected that Lu Zhen liked someone, but since Lu Zhen hadn\u2019t come to school for a long time nor take the initiative to find Chu Yin\u2026They knew they had a chance!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even the adopted daughter was treated like a biological one? Then the real daughter was thought to be the adopted daughter. I\u2019m speechless! Yin yin, you\u2019ve been mistreated.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201dIt was fun to play fake sisters in this life. It\u2019s just a pity that she won\u2019t be able to see her snake dances in the future.As for the identity of this true daughter, she never cared about it from the beginning.After all, she knew that the decline of the Chu family was a matter of time.Han Chuying realized that she didn\u2019t care, so she no longer dwelled on the issue and changed the subject.\u201cBy the way, Yin Yin, the rest of the money for the live performance has been received. I will transfer it to you.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYou earned it in your account.\u201dHan Chuying: \u201cBut the amount of performances and rewards are all because of you \u2014 people are still asking for your performance every day. Seriously, you can earn more money with it.\u201dChu Yin thought about it.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Chu Yin said. \u201cThe most important thing now is the mock exam and the final exam. \u201cHan Chuying: \u201cI know.\u201dDuring the hottest month of summer, the college entrance examination arrived. Three days later, the top two senior classes held a mock exam, which lasted for two days.Although the answer could be found online now, most of the students wanted to test their abilities.There were few students in the top class. They got the points quickly. Although no one scored above 700 points, Chu Yin was in first place with a total score of 683.There are few students in the top class, and they get points quickly. In this grade, there were no more than 700 points like our school\u2019s examination, but Chu Yin still sat in the first place, with a total score of 683, dropping second place with 33 points.\u201cFuck, the liberal arts scoref the highest with 683?!\u201dShe was only a sophomore in high school! Her score was only 10 points lower than the provincial champion! What kind of level was this!Chu Yin was also a little surprised before happiness siped in her heart.If she could get the champion, how high would the rewards be from the system? She was excited from thinking about it.The school leaders and teachers of Huiwen were also collectively excited \u2013 the future champion!They must pour their hearts out!Jiang Yan and the others all came to worship Chu Yin\u2019s scores, as they asked expectantly: \u201cYin Yin, what major do you want to study once you get admitted to a university? \u201cAfter all, judging by Chu Yin\u2019s points, even if she didn\u2019t get her top major pick, the nation\u2019s prestigious universities would have signed her in.Chu Yin pondered for a few seconds and said, \u201cFinance.\u201dShe wanted to make a lot of money more than doing scientific research. In her last life, she studied business.She was influenced by Lu Zhen and learned a lot. Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have the chance to show her strength.If things go well, she could also become a president and set up her business empire.Maybe one day she could step on Lu\u2019s head.When that time comes, Lu Zhen, that dog man, has to offer her tea!\u2026Lu Linyuan just came out of the hospital and got into the car that waiting at the door.Although the gauze on his wounded face was taken off, it still wasn\u2019t comfortable.Lu Linyuan had always been elegant in front of the public. He also attached great importance to his image. Since the time he was injured, he couldn\u2019t appear in public for some timeThe special assistant was reporting to him every day. Everything was stable in the Lu\u2019s Group.It\u2019s probably because of the successor, Young Master Lu, who did everything well.Young, calm, bold, and born with a good sense of business. He shocked the board of directors and everyone in the business world by doing two major projects in succession.To be able to do these achievements at this age, it was no exaggeration that he was called a genius.The families of various groups would visit their residence, accompanied by their daughters.The Liang family would invite the Lu family to tea while expressing their hints of marriage.All the people were desiring for the Lu family.These things naturally reached Lu Linyuan\u2019s ears through the people he planted in the group.He leaned against the back seat, slightly closing his eyes.If the child is precocious, it won\u2019t be lovely.What are you so anxious about, immediately showing off your feathers? Do you not want to be sheltered by your uncle?He didn\u2019t speak so the driver of the car was also afraid to speak out.After a long time, Lu Linyuan lightly muttered. \u201cGo to the other hall. Relax.\u201dHe would relieve the pressure put on his little nephew.The driver\u2019s expression was slightly stunned: \u201cYes.\u201d\u2026The hidden factory on the outskirts of the city.This was the place Lu Linyuan casually manages. The police would never come. It was still night, and the people walking around was relatively small.Lu Linyuan casually walked, smiling as he asked, \u201cAre there any fun activities today?\u201dA man walked forward respectfully, frowning, and keeping his eyes lowered \u2013 not showing the discoloration of injury on his face.\u201cMr. Lu, yes. There is a child who is very tender. He\u2019s been looking for you.\u201dLu Linyuan showed a slight smile, patted him affectionately on the cheek, and then walked towards the soundproof room deep in the corridor.After a few steps, he suddenly stopped, turned half side, and smiled gracefully. \u201cWhat about the whip?\u201dThe man said immediately: \u201cYes, sir. I\u2019ll send it to your room immediately.\u201dThe smile on Lu Linyuan\u2019s face showed satisfaction. He turned around, his eyes becoming a little excited.The wound on his face looked really uncomfortable, so he had to make other people suffer as well.Can you get a good shape of the whip?He wanted to try it on them now.\u2026Song Yanchuan leaned on the door, watching Lu Linyuan walking out of the broken factory.There was still a little excitement on his face, which was contrary to his refined temperament.Damn. Fucking old pervert.Lu Linyuan came over and saw him: \u201cOh, Xiao Song, do you want to go and play?\u201dSong Yanchuan waved his hand: \u201cNext time.\u201dThe two talked about the company outside the car, and then Lu Linyuan asked nonchalantly, \u201cIs my nephew doing very well in the group recently?\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s expression remained unchanged: \u201cYes, just fine.\u201dLu Linyuan blinked. \u201cWhat do you think of his future?\u201dSong Yanchuan sneered: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it in ten years when he grows more hair.\u201dLu Linyuan laughed.After the exchange of conversations between the two, Song Yanchuan didn\u2019t stay long and drove away soon.Lu Linyuan got into his car and spoke to the driver. \u201cYou know, Xiao Song obviously thinks that my nephew is meticulously good. He just said that for my benefit.\u201d\u201cBut Mr. Song must understand that Young Master Lu is not comparable with you now,\u201d Lu Linyuan saidLu Linyuan shrugged: \u201cBut I\u2019m really old, the young people nowadays are too good.\u201dMy dear nephew, if you don\u2019t control yourself, I might step your head\u2013People like Lu Zhen had been favored by the world since they were born, just like the center of the world.If they were divided into roles like in a movie, then his elder brother who died young, and his talented nephew, would probably the protagonist of the world, and he may be a twisted villain.\u201cBut, God is fair. Although the protagonist is dazzling, they all have fatal weaknesses. The villain does not. \u201cThe driver did not understand, but still put on a suitable expression and asked: \u201cWhat is the weakness?\u201d\u201cDo you know the characteristics of the Lu family men?\u201d\u201cDo you know the characteristics of Lu family men?\u201d Lu Linyuan was going to talk about something interesting but burst out laughing, \u201cDon\u2019t look at me. I\u2019m not one of them. I\u2019m talking about the full-blood Lu family men.\u201d\u201cThey are are all stupid dogs emotionally.\u201d\u201cThey can be led by the nose by those women. They can\u2019t let go of this or that. They can only be coaxed by women. They will even give up everything for women. They are so mentally retarded that they are no inferior than the dogs.\u201dThe driver didn\u2019t say a word.\u201cSo, do you know how to defeat this kind of person?\u201d Lu Linyuan asked with a smile.The driver replied tremblingly: \u201cPlease tell me, Mr. Lu.\u201d\u201cOf course, with their weaknesses~\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On the day before the college entrance exam, Wei Heiming told her he would wait for her in City B.Song Zhaolin was moved by him as he watched, but Chu Yin was still polite and distant.Although many people thought they were a couple, Wei Heiming and Chu Yin could hardly be seen in the same frame for so long. Chu Yin hadn\u2019t shown any state of being in love so the rumors gradually disappeared.Their Sister Yin might not like anyone! She hadn\u2019t had any feelings about anyone else before!In the final examination, the contest for second place was still in progress.After a year, the first place had become a \u2018fixed spot\u2019, so whoever could take the second place was considered impressive.Chu Yin was still ranked first. Jiang Yan improved her mathematics score at the end of the semester and moved up in the rankings.Song Zhaolin: \u201cI have also moved forward~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c?\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cBecause of the departure of Wang Xiaoyan, I finally made progress.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dChu Qiuqiu was already notorious in Huiwen, especially after knowing the things she did to Chu Yin.Song Zhaolin was annoyed her.After the results were announced, Han Chuying also ran over.\u201cAhh, my mathematics score is in second!\u201d Han Chuying excitedly said, \u201cI and Yin Yin are next to each other! Thank you, Lu Zhen!\u201dAccording to rankings, the top two spots for Mathematics were Chu Yin and Lu Zhen. Since Young Master Lu did not take the exam, Han Chuying and got the spot next to Chu Yin.Lu Zhen was busy. Chu Yin remembered that Lu Zhen in his previous life did not take over the Lu family\u2019s business so early. He stayed in school throughout high school.Could it be that since the timeline had advanced, Lu Zhen\u2019s career had also advanced? Chu Yin thought for a while. She also felt that Lu Zhen\u2019s change was different from his perverted uncle.From the current point of view, Lu Zhen showed no signs of blackening.If Lu Zhen was a good dog in this life, then she hoped he could protect his family\u2019s property and not be taken by Lu Linyuan, the old pervert.Han Chuying stayed in Class 5 for a while. Before leaving, she suddenly remembered something. She turned around and asked Chu Yin, \u201cBy the way, Yin Yin, are you going to that summer camp?\u201dThere were summer camps prepared for the upcoming third-year students. This was different from the Winter Camp they had participated in before since this wasn\u2019t a competition. The purpose of these summer camps was to develop the learning habits of the students so they could be fully prepared for the third-year high school experience.The summer camp would last for the entire summer. A camp with close-learning experience, equipped with experienced teachers, productive study schedules, and the chance to learn from renowned people. Everything was good\u2026except with one thing:Too expensive!Because of the duration of the camp, plus good accommodation and excellent learning environment, the cost was high. Although Chu Yin hoped to participate in this kind of amazing environment during the holidays, she couldn\u2019t afford it at the moment.She didn\u2019t intend to let her brother know about this. It was difficult enough for Chu Shi to support the entire Chu family.She had no choice but to give up. But it\u2019s okay. Anyway, she had asked in advance if she could stay in Huiwen\u2019s dormitory during the vacation. The cleaning lady would absent so all the sanitation work should be done by herself. The cafeteria wasn\u2019t open, she needed to do the food herself tooIt was fine.Han Chuying felt pity. If she could go to summer camp with Chu Yin, they could live in the dormitory again! And this time, it would be more than 40 days! Their relationship would totally develop!Han Chuying left regretfully, but after a while, she ran in again excitedly.\u201cThe news that just arrived! Students in second place and above can be given the spots! Yin Yin, you can go to the camp for free!\u201dChu Yin was a little surprised: \u201cReally?\u201d\u2026\u201cYoung Master, I have already told you.\u201dLu Zhen looked at the list of students joining the camp, and his eyes fell on the word Chu Yin. His eyes stayed there for a few seconds before nodding: \u201cYes, I see.\u201dAssistant Zhou had been following the Young Master for several months already. He was now one of Lu Zhen\u2019s confidants. He was prejudiced before when Grandfather Lu assigned him to Lu Zhen because of his age. But now, who would even dare underestimate this Young Master?Assistant\u00a0 Zhou felt that he was holding the golden thigh of the future.The Young Master invested in the summer camp. He was told to deal with it in secret since some of the funds came from Lu Zhen\u2019s private account. Assistant Zhou had full trust in him so he handled it very secretly and securely.Lu Zhen sponsored several slots for the camp. One of the campers was his classmate.Assistant Zhou, an experienced businessman, could see the meaning.He tentatively said. \u201cYoung Master, this summer camp is for the whole summer, plus there\u2019s closed management. This\u2026sending people in is not\u2026\u201dLu Zhen suddenly raised his eyes slightly.His black pupils stared at him, looking like a nocturnal creature. Assistant Zhou fell silent for an instant, cold sweat coming out from his back.He instinctively realized that some people, even if they were young, were naturally superior. They could give others the benefit of their trust, but they won\u2019t allow you to go beyond the rules.Assistant Zhou took a step back quickly and bowed: \u201cSorry, Young Master, I talked too much.\u201dLu Zhen retracted his gaze, his aura recovered.Lu Zhen put away the admission list, locked it in the drawer, and said lightly: \u201cClosed management for long period is good.\u201dAssistant Zhou didn\u2019t expect that he would xplain, and asked in fear, \u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes as he lightly turned the pen.\u201cFor safety.\u201dAt the same moment.In Lu Linyuan\u2019s deputy general manager\u2019s office, the assistant reported his schedule. \u201cThere will be a meeting at one o\u2019clock, and both Old Master Lu and Young Master will attend. There will be a dinner with Mr. Gu at five o\u2019clock in the afternoon.\u201dLu Linyuan listened to it one by one, nodded, and asked: \u201cAh Zhen is in the company every day, and doesn\u2019t go to school much?\u201dThe Assistant answered: \u201cYes, Young Master didn\u2019t take the final exam.\u201dLu Linyuan laughed. \u201cWhat about the girl? Is she still living in the school dormitory?\u201d\u00a0It\u2019s time to see her too.The Assistant\u2019s expression was a little embarrassed: \u201cYes, but Miss Chu is about to leave for the summer camp that will have closed-management until the opening of the school.\u201dLu Linyuan raised his eyebrows: \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201dThen he would see her at the beginning of school. They could always meet~\u201cLet\u2019s go to the meeting room.\u201d\u201cLook at the surprise my dear nephew prepared for me today.\u201dThe day before she left for camp, Chu Yin realized what she had missed.Her task rewards for getting first place in the mock exam and first place in the final exam had not been issued yet!!Chu Yin hurriedly poked the system: \u201cXueji, get out!\u201dXueji: \u201cDing.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYou\u2019ve been really lazy ately.\u201dXueji: \u201cDue to the recent drastic fluctuations in the world\u2019s energy, the system needs to update data parameters regularly and re calculate and evaluate. This system did not intend to slack off~ Don\u2019t worry, Xueji must accompany the host to the end~\u201dChu Yin completely ignored the system\u2019s confession, and focused on the middle few words: \u201cDrastic fluctuations? When?\u201dXueji: \u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cAnd you didn\u2019t tell me?!\u201dXueji: \u201cThe host didn\u2019t ask.\u201dShe suspected that this system was deliberately hiding something.She didn\u2019t hear the system prompting the first time a fluctuation occurred. Chu Yin had reasons to suspect that there were other hints she missed.What\u2019s the exception for the world\u2019s energy fluctuating?What happened that resulted in the world\u2019s energy fluctuating drastically?If the development was stable according to the original plot, what major turning point had occurred?Chu Yin sat cross-legged on the head of the bed, thinking for a long time.What could make the plot change greatly? Certainly, supporting characters didn\u2019t have the ability for it.Both the protagonist and the villain could affect the core plot. The protagonist\u2026she didn\u2019t do anything unusual\u2026then Lu Zhen?Was Lu Zhen finding her golden finger counts as a major turning point?After the dog man realized it, he didn\u2019t even dwell on it. It didn\u2019t seem to be a factor that could fluctuate the plot?Was it the villain?Chu Yin thought of Lu Linyuan and felt it was likely.After all, the old pervert was the most abnormal character she had ever seen. He looked gentle in the sugar but had a dirty soul inside. She had no idea of Lu Linyuan\u2019s character in the previous life. She couldn\u2019t predict if there were more abnormal things in the future.Xueji took a long time before loading her task rewards:\u201cDing- successfully completed-[First place in Mock Test], [First place in Final Exam]. Host has obtained the permission of [Change a Single Sentence], and an activation card.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYou gave only a single permission for the successful two missions? What is an activation card?\u201dXue Ji: \u201cBecause the host\u2019s level continues to improve, the final exam task rewards are incorporated into the mock exam task rewards. Activation Card means that the host can activate the expired cards~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThen what invalid item cards do I have?\u201d\u201cThere is only one phrase card~\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201d Okay, she even had no options to choose from.\u201cThen activate this card.\u201dChu Yin hugged her arm and sighed, waiting for the system to unlock the script.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This day was an important occasion for the board of directors to decide whether to hand over the Mingyuan Development Zone Project to Lu Zhen or Lu Linyuan. They need to make the final choice since this decision is about the future power structure of the group\u2026\u3011\u3010\u2026Lu Linyuan is determined to win the Mingyuan Development Zone..\u3011Here it is.Chu Yin bit her nails. It seemed that Lu Linyuan was plotting for the Lu Family\u2019s property. In her last life, Lu Zhen trusted him so much and regarded him as his uncle.This was too miserable.Chu Yin suddenly realized that she overlooked too many details in her previous life. With Lu Zhen\u2019s current strength, it would be difficult to contend with Lu Linyuan. In addition to Lu Linyuan\u2019s outside connections, she couldn\u2019t guarantee if he would these forces against Lu Zhen\u2019s.Can this dog man defeat him\u2026Chu Yin groaned, reading down two more paragraphs.\u3010Lu Linyuan said to the Assistant: \u201cGive Chu Yin a bunch of flowers in my name. Pick the cute ones.\u201dThe Assistant: \u201cYes, Mr. Lu.\u201d\u3011Chu Yin:???Why was Lu Linyuan interested in her? What could he get from her?Chu Yin remembered that in the two brief contacts with Lu Linyuan in her previous life, he was also very gentle and considerate, so Chu Yin had a good impression of him before.Did Lu Linyuan approach her in her last life for the same purpose as he did in this life?Chu Yin hugged her arm and rubbed it. She felt very uncomfortable.She grabbed the light pen as it landed on the script, deciding to change the plot.Anyway, she couldn\u2019t allow this old pervert to be too comfortable.\u3010Lu Linyuan is determined to win the Mingyuan Development Zone\u3011?Chu Yin thought for a while. She crossed out [ win ], and changed it to [ give up ]Hmpf.She was really a living Buddha. She was helping the Dog Man.\u2026Lu Zhen looked in the mirror, buttoned his shirt, and then put on a dark black tie.The 17-year-old man wore a handmade custom-made suit. His body was tall and slender. And his aura was serious and cold.Although he came fully prepared, it would still be a tough battle.Lu Linyuan\u2019s ten years of experience in the business world earned him his power. More than half of the board of directors still support Lu Linyuan. Lu Zhen must get their support and recognition today.Assistant Zhou came over: \u201cMaster, it\u2019s time.\u201dLu Zhen raised his eyes, revealing the sharp outline of his eyelids, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dBoth the uncle and nephew met outside the meeting room.Lu Linyuan laughed, walked closer, and gave Lu Zhen a hug. \u201cA Zhen, long time no see.\u201dThe injury on his face was already healed. It\u2019s only been covered by a layer of foundation. The scars weren\u2019t visible.Lu Zhen also smiled: \u201cMy uncle has worked hard.\u201dLu Linyuan blinked: \u201cYou have worked hard too. I feel distressed when I hear them talk about your usual work state.\u201dLu Zhen smiled perfectly: \u201cYes.\u201dThis uncle and nephew talked and smiled.But everyone knew that today\u2019s meeting must be difficult\u2026The meeting ended early just an hour later.Lu Zhen raised his eyebrow and looked at him.And on the opposite side, Lu Linyuan was also smiling, his face not revealing anything. The Assistant behind him also completely forgot his professional etiquette as his face showed confusion.They prepared so much before this meeting and yet Mr. Lu willingly gave up without a fight??Old Master Lu was still praising: \u201cLinyuan is really an outstanding person. I didn\u2019t expect you to give up this big project on your own initiative.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very kind of you.\u201d\u201cYour shoulders is now heavy with the burden, Young Master!\u201dLu Linyuan did not stay to socialize with the directors as usual. This day, he turned pale and left early.After the meeting, Lu Zhen walked to the windows and quietly overlooked the whole city.He prepared for a long time for this, but now that it was in his hands, Lu Zhen\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t excited.He was thinking about a certain person.After a long time, Lu Zhen lowered his head and laughed softly.Thank you for your courage.Chu Yin\u2019s life in the summer camp was very peaceful. She did not forget to pay attention to the script situation in real time.Lu Zhen did win the project of the development zone. Lu Linyuan voluntarily gave up in front of all the directors and Old Master Lu, so there was no chance of obtaining it again.Chu Yin: Hahehe! I\u2019m the hammer of fate. How do you feel now?You still want to send me flowers? Pooh!Chu Yin closed the script and wanted to continue studying but she suddenly caught a glimpse of an address on the script.\u2026Abandoned Factory?Chu Yan did not know why this plot appeared in the script \u2014\u3010Lu Linyuan lost the project of the development zone and made a major mistake. To relieve the mood, he drove to the abandoned factory in the suburb of the city.\u3011Chu Yin frowned\u2014what kind of relief is this? How to solve it? Going to hit the iron?She turned a page, looked down two lines, her pupils suddenly shrunk.This factory\u2014?!?!Chu Yin\u2019s hair stood up\u2014She originally thought that Lu Linyuan was abnormal enough to have the mentality to abuse women, but now it seems to be more than that!This was a place for illegal business, which was specially set up for noble people. Chu Yin suspected that this was one of his methods to win over famous people. In this underground entertainment facility, there was too much abuse happening.Chu Yin felt nauseous and flustered.If Lu Linyuan was so evil, how could he have a good relationship with the Lu family in the previous life?!What did he do??Chu Yin looked at the script. On, Lu Linyuan went in and ordered a young girl to accompany him. There were no other details about the plot, but there were two sentences-\u3010The whip in Lu Linyuan\u2019s hand was wrapped by iron wires. It would make the skin open with a single whip.\u3011\u3010He smiled softly, touched the top of the girl\u2019s hair, and whipped the girl in front of him.\u3011Chu Yan was so angry that she almost passed out \u2013 ah!It\u2019s no use for this old pervert to kneel down and apologize!If kneeling can atone for your sins, what\u2019s the use of the police?If the police are useless, what should this, father, Chu Yin, do?Chu Yin sneered.The hammer she used was too gentle.This time she decided to hammer the nail so hard!She knocked on the system expressionlessly: \u201cHow do you use that phrase card? \u201cXueji: \u201cPhrase card, as the name implies, can change a phrase. For example, \u201cXX places XX\u201d, \u201cXX gets XX\u201d, or verb, subject, and predicate phrases are also possible!\u201dChu Yin scanned the script in front of her: Very good.\u201cUse phrase card.\u201d She ordered.Then, she grabbed the light pen and crossed out [ The girl in front of him ]Changed to-[ his lower body ]Ah \u2013 I can\u2019t imagine how painful it isPlease experience it with your heart.\u2026That night.The sirens of the ambulance resounded over the city.Lu Linyuan was directly sent to the emergency room.According to rumors, the man was lying on a stretcher with blood all over his lower body, which was terrible!\u2026At a small restaurant on the other side of the city, a man opened the door, and a wind chime rang.Song Yanchuan sat in the last row, facing the man at the table.\u201cHere?\u201d The young man behind him has a clear voice.Song Yanchuan: \u201cYes.\u201dHe was quiet for a while before his complexion collapsed. \u201cYoung Master, are you the chosen son of god?\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s matter was simply unthinkable. Amazingly, even God chose to help Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen picked up the cup and took a sip of coffee, \u201cNo.\u201dSong Yanchuan felt fortunate that he chose Lu Zhen.\u201cI thank you for your cooperation.\u201d Song Yanchuan said. \u201cYou really have the help of the gods\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes gently fluttered.There is no god to help him.If there is a god in this world, then his god is a girl.After a while, there was no response, so Song Yanchuan asked, \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201dLu Zhen put down the coffee cup and suddenly smiled.\u201cThinking of God.\u201dSuddenly at this moment\u2026 he miss her very much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Many people saw Lu Linyuan\u2019s emergency room visit that day, so even if Chu Yin was in a closed summer camp, she could still see some gossips on the Internet.Do you love to torture women? Use the whip to slap people? Engage in illegal business?Then be cleaner \u00a0I\u2019ll clean you.The abandoned factory at the scene of the crime was emptied overnight. When the local police received the alarm and rushed to the scene in a hurry, the scene had been destroyed.There was no evidence that this place was used as a gold-selling cave.Chu Yin also knew that it was impossible to bring down the old pervert Lu Linyuan this time, but fortunately, she acted immediately! Destroyed his tools of crime!She hoped the villain would change his mind and be a good man!Otherwise, the hammer of fate would still come!Amen.\u2026The VIP ward of the hospital.Lu Linyuan sat by the window, his face like a still statue.How on earth did he whip himself that day? How did it hit his lower part so precisely?If the person who harmed him fell into his hands, he would smash that person\u2019s whole body with several hits of the whip.Lu Linyuan cut off the flower stems of the green plants by the window. His eyes were a little dark.At this time, someone knocked at the door of the ward. The emotion in Lu Linyuan\u2019s eyes faded like a tide.Grandfather Lu walked to Lu Linyuan\u2019s bed with a cane, looked at his pale and gloomy face, and stomped the crutches: \u201cThis is nonsense!\u201dThis was the biggest humiliation of their Lu family! It happened to his little son who was always excellent, calm, and capable! How could he accept this!Wearing a hospital gown, Lu Linyuan lowered his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Dad.\u201dHe had already undergone an operation. Although his appearance looked no different from before, there were internal lifetime changes he couldn\u2019t avoid.Grandfather Lu was a man so he naturally knew that Lu Linyuan must be in a bad mood right now. His tone slowed down a little ad he said, \u201cYou, you are still young so you can still play\u2013but how can you do those things?\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s eyebrows nervously jumped.He was referring to the abandoned factory, which he (Grandfather Lu) crushed down quickly.Ha, of course, the old man wasn\u2019t doing it for him, he was doing it to protect the Lu Family\u2019s reputation.\u201cYou should take care of your injury first, this injury\u2026cough! I will help you figure out a solution later,\u201d Grandfather Lu was a little embarrassed, \u201cYou have a good rest.\u201dLu Linyuan: \u201cDad, walk slowly.\u201dWhen the room quieted down, the gentle expression on Lu Linyuan\u2019s face suddenly disappeared.Because of his habit of smiling, his face formed several smile lines, which were usually considered elegant and handsome.But now that he wasn\u2019t smiling, the traces of the lines were particularly obvious, and there was a chilling gloomy feeling.\u201cThink of a solution?\u201d The man\u2019s voice was soft.A few seconds later, there was a strange low laugh in the ward.What could he do?The only way to make him happy was to kill all those people who stepped on him. The pain he suffered should be experienced by people before he could feel comfortable.Lu Linyuan could have waited a few more years. But now, it seems that God was urging him.He raised his hand, looked at his well-trimmed nails, and thought silently:\u00a0Ah Zhen, don\u2019t blame me.Blame yourself for being too like your father, being too good, and having no other weaknesses\u2026As a villain, he can only start with their weakness~When the assistant entered the ward, he happened to see this picture.Even though the ward was spacious, the aura was gloomy and dark.This summer, Chu Yin had a very fulfilling life in the summer camp.She would go to bed early, get up early, study in class, eat and drink well, and get used to the rhythm of the life of a third-year student in advance.The teachers at the summer camp also liked her very much. They believed that this child was likely to appear on the red list of champions next year, so they taught her well.In addition, Chu Yin had reviewed all the knowledge needed, which was equivalent to learning twice than her current classmates.Since school just started, most of the students were sleepy and sluggish. Song Zhaolin had felt timid and sleepy for the first few days because according to him, the last summer vacation before the third year of high school should be used well, so he went outside to play a lot, and only did his homework three days before school starts.As a result, he snored loudly in class one day and was called by the headteacher to report to his parents. When he came home that night, he was beaten so clearly that he didn\u2019t dare to sleep in class anymore.The most obvious change for third-year students was the curriculum.Their physical education classes had been reduced. Sanda class, Badminton class, and so on were all reduced to ordinary sports venues, and there was only one class a week. In addition, two more evenings of self-study were added after school every day, and everyone\u2019s time in school was also extended.Of course, it was nothing for students who lived in the dormitories, but students who were only accustomed to day school needed to adjust to it for a while.Song Zhaolin felt that the third year of high school was too difficult! There were so many papers and little time to play. If his brother didn\u2019t force him to go to college, he would like to study excavator in Lanxiang.\u201cYou are a rich young master, you want to drive an excavator?\u201d Chu Yin asked.Song Zhaolin: \u201cSister Yin, you can\u2019t underestimate someone who drives an excavator!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cI didn\u2019t underestimate them, I underestimated you.\u201dSong Zhaolin curled his lips aggrievedly.Even Lin Zi was starting to prepare for the IELTS test, and Brother Zhen was fighting alone in the business world.Fortunately, a few days later, the exciting news came out-The school organized an autumn tour, especially for the third grade. They were to climb mountains in the suburbs. Through the sport of mountain climbing, they could hone their perseverance and make a better decisive battle.Song Zhaolin was very excited. Of course, it wasn\u2019t because of the exercises, but because he could go out and play!Although Chu Yin was not interested in autumn outings, this was another must-attend activity. If she was absent, points would be deducted from the class.She seldom went out of school, and her life is three points and one line. But because I have to climb the mountain, I have to go out and buy a pair of suitable sports shoes.When she left the school gate, she rode a car to the mall, and suddenly felt something was wrong.There was an inexplicable feeling of\u2026 being followed.She took out the script and read it. These specific details were not recorded in the plot.Who\u2026?Chu Yin was not afraid, after all, if the other party really did anything to her, there would be a plot in the script. She walked into the mall calmly, walked around casually, bought a pair of light and simple shoes, and then went back the same way.On the way, the feeling of being followed was still there.But Chu Yin kept walking into the school gate, and the person following her still didn\u2019t show up.It felt like she was being followed by\u2026a bodyguard?It\u2019s a little strange.\u2026Lu Zhen and Song Yanchuan made an appointment to meet in a restaurant in Linjiang.Since Lu Linyuan\u2019s accident, he didn\u2019t often show up at the company, but apparently, he did a lot in private. Song Yanchuan brought the information he had to Lu Zhen.\u201cYour uncle is indeed a ruthless person,\u201d Song Yanchuan took a sip of tea. \u201cEven if he is injured, he can still work.\u201dLu Zhen nodded: \u201cI know.\u201dSong Yanchuan: \u201cWhat\u2019s your agenda?\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyelashes and gently rubbed the edge of the cup with his finger: \u201cI have a plan.\u201dHe had experienced all these things once, and all he had to do was overthrow the past.Song Yanchuan didn\u2019t ask much, after all, he only cared about the interests of the Song family. Although he partnered up with Lu Zhen, he still hadn\u2019t lost his connection with Lu Linyuan. Even if he loses the bet, he could still act as a double spy and continue to support Lu Linyuan.It depended on the results of the internal fighting of the Lu family.Before leaving, Song Yanchuan suddenly remembered something.\u201cOh, by the way, my little brother is very excited about the autumn outing. I know the date of their autumn tour.\u201d Song Yanchuan paused, watching Lu Zhen\u2019s calm profile face.\u201dSo when the old pervert asked me, I told him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although the young man in front of him was the same age as Song Zhaolin, Song Yanchuan couldn\u2019t lump them together. \u201cI can\u2019t make Lu Linyuan suspicious\u2013and you said that you sent someone to protect her.\u201dLu Zhen indifferently stared at him for a few seconds, before getting up and walking away.\u2026Chu Yin felt that this autumn tour was preventing her from studying.At this time, was it not good to do the questions in the classroom? ? What mountain did she need to climb to improve?Although summer has passed, the sun is still hot and poisonous. She was tired after climbing up the big mountain.She had been diligent in her studies so her physical fitness wasn\u2019t that good.Song Zhaolin was as lively as a little pony, he seemed to jump from one place to another, as his happy laughter echoed in the mountains.This mountain was called Magnetic Mountain (\u78c1\u5c71 ). Even though it wasn\u2019t high, it was wide. In addition to the area that became a scenic spot, there were still many paths in it. You could go deep into its wild forest.Therefore, the headteachers who led the team were very cautious, reminding students along the way not to leave the large group.\u201cSong Zhaolin! What are you doing!\u201d Sister Wang yelled out, \u201cGet back!\u201dSong Zhaolin quickly withdrew from exploring the wild forest.He pretended to be nonchalant and looked around at the beautiful scenery. Suddenly, seeing a familiar figure flashing by in a long-distance, his eyes immediately widened.Is that Brother Zhen??Couldn\u2019t be! Shouldn\u2019t Brother Zhen be outside the city two days ago for work?Song Zhaolin rubbed his eyes, thinking that he might have imagined it.\u2026\u2026Although the teachers tried to control it, the formation of the classes soon broke down. Because of the different physical abilities and willpower of the students, there was a big distance between the two groups.Chu Yin hung at the end of the crowd. Both Jiang Yan and Song Zhaolin wanted to climb to the top. Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to hold them back, so she climbed slowly by herself.There was a small shop at every checkpoint of the mountain road. There were also pavilions for resting.She intended to sit down and answer some math problems. Climbing to the top of the mountain would not help her, so it was better to answer problems in the mountain.Anyway, after they had climbed to the top of the mountain, they had to return the same way. Chu Yin could just sit here and wait, intending to quietly join the group of students later.She walked into the pavilion silently. As soon as she sat down, the grandmother of the small shop smiled and greeted her: \u201cLittle girl is so beautiful! I have been sitting here for a day, and you are the most beautiful of all the students!\u201dChu Yin looked at the drinks on her stall and knew that she was probably trying to promote sales.Sure enough, the grandmother continued in the next sentence: \u201cIs little girl thirsty? Our water is purely filtered!\u201dChu Yin sighed. In order to be able to answer a few questions quietly, she got up and walked to the canteen.At this moment, the teachers and students had all gone up, and no one passed by.Chu Yin walked under the eaves and lowered her head: \u201cThen I want a bottle of ice red\u2013\u201cAt this time, she suddenly noticed that someone was quickly approaching behind her!Chu Yin was about to turn back when she was held by the old woman in the store. Her face was full of wrinkles with a smile, and her muddy eyes narrowed: \u201cLittle girl, get water!\u201dChu Yin knew immediately that it was not good. She didn\u2019t predict this accident would happen.She estimated that there were still two seconds before she could jump on her. The thin and weak old woman was so strong that she held her tightly. She probably thought that she was a little girl that couldn\u2019t beat her.Chu Yin acted decisively. She directly backhanded her with force, twisting her arm with a \u201ccrack\u201d sound.The other party screamed and released her hand. Chu Yin turned around and ran without stopping for a second.She couldn\u2019t be here alone, she had to go to crowded places!She rushed to the road. After just two steps up the mountain, there was already a man in black running towards her.When she looked down the mountain, another man was still waiting for her.\u2014Premeditated?!Chu Yin laughed. She didn\u2019t know she had to experience this kind of drama by just attending the autumn tour.But right now she had no other choice, so she turned her head and plunged into the wild forest.Anyway, as long as she could get rid of these people, she could open the script, so Chu Yin was not afraid.She was careful with the mountain paths. As she entered the forest deeper, the sound of someone chasing behind her finally disappeared.Chu Yin panted. She was so tired that she sat on the ground while being supported by a tree.It hadn\u2019t been long when the bushes a few meters away suddenly had a rustling sound.Chu Yin\u2019s heart beat wildly.Did they find her?She carefully stepped back into the tree and told the system to open the script.It\u2019s okay, don\u2019t panic, no one can touch me\u2014Just when she was about to use the script, the figure behind the bush finally came out.The young man was in a mess, panting in confusion. He was relieved for a moment when he saw her.Chu Yin was stunned before calming herself.They hadn\u2019t met for so long.And now, she actually met him here?Lu Zhen stood on the same spot, closed his eyes, and took a deep breath. He strode towards her, his face not looking good.Chu Yin was startled, suddenly realizing that what if Lu Zhen was the one who tried to kidnap her?She subconsciously took a step back, and suddenly, the soles of her shoes were broken-The grass was so thick that the back of the tree formed a slope!Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help swearing in her heart. Just as she was about to slip down, Lu Zhen arrived in time, grabbed her wrist, and moved to her side.Because of the inertia, Chu Yin bumped into him.\u201cMy nose!\u201dLu Zhen raised his hand, squeezed her ear bones, and rubbed the back of her head: \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201dChu Yin held her nose for a long time before pushing him away. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt.\u201dLu Zhen helplessly looked down at the tip of her red nose, \u201cSorry.\u201dHe didn\u2019t expect to be misunderstood by Chu Yin when he entered the forest as he saw strange people were chasing her.Originally, Lu Zhen was just watching in the dark to make sure she was safe. But the moment he saw something happened, his heart jumped.Even if he knew she had the means to protect herself, he was still afraid that she would fall to the bottom of the hillside-too late to save herself.Chu Yin calmed down and understood that Lu Zhen wasn\u2019t her captor.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It needed more thinking.The person in front of her was also acting weird.Chu Yin raised his eyes and looked at him: \u201cWhy are you here?\u201dLu Zhen recovered his aura, lowering his eyes, he said: \u201cI just saw you being chased, so I came to save you.\u201dChu Yin was suspicious: \u201cDid you go to school? Why did you come to this autum tour?\u201dLu Zhen looked at her and not said anything.There were only two of them in this mountain forest.The shade of trees and the sound of insects in the distance formed a small world for them.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart relaxed a little, no one would stare at him here.He wanted to ask so badly but couldn\u2019t dare utter it. His gaze fell on Chu Yin\u2019s face and softly smiled, \u201cChu Yin, why did you help me?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t find any other reason for Lu Linyuan\u2019s incident except for the influence of Chu Yin\u2019s power.Although Chu Yin instantly understood what he meant, she innocently showed a blank face: \u201cWhat did I help you with?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips curled lightly, raised his hand, and touched the tip of her red nose with his fingertips.Then, Lu Zhen withdrew his hand and said, \u201cGo back now. If your teachers can\u2019t find you, they\u2019ll be worried.\u201dIf Lu Zhen was not here, she could change the script and find her way back.She looked at Lu Zhen who was waiting for her to lead the way and gritted her teeth.The dog man wants to watch her fall off the horse again!Chu Yin pretended to be distressed, looking for the way in the forest: \u201cI don\u2019t seem to remember anymore, I can only\u00a0try\u00a0to find the way.\u201dLu Zhen was not impatient. He followed her as his eyes softly gazed.If it\u2019s possible, he\u2019s willing to go on like this forever.He was not in a hurry, but Chu Yin gradually became anxious.The sky began to darken a little bit, and she guessed that the large group of students had already begun to return.In this silent battle, she was slightly worse than the dog man.Chu Yin bit her lips. She can\u2019t afford to take risks so she secretly changed the plot of the script to [Chu Yin found the path smoothly].Next, at every fork in the road, Chu Yin was able to find the right direction.Lu Zhen once again looked at the section of the road he passed through and smiled: \u201cYou have this kind of good memory?\u201dChu Yin said, \u201cHaha, really lucky, haha.\u201dShe was \u2018lucky\u2019 at finding the way five consecutive times. The outline of the road loomed in the distance.Lu Zhen smiled silently.There was an intense curiosity in his heart.Although there would be no opportunity to get closer to her and touch her \u2018superpowers\u2019.He wanted to\u2026try.Try to see if she was his god.Could she control him? Change his destiny? And give him new life?Chu Yin was about to turn her head when she suddenly heard a soft \u201chiss\u201d sound from behind her.As soon as she turned around, she noticed that a lot of blood was bleeding on Lu Zhen\u2019s arm, which completely soaked his sleeves.Her eyes opened in surprise: \u201cAre you hurt?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cYes.\u201dChu Yin frowned and said nothing. He was probably injured before and this dog man had a high pain tolerance.ToLu Zhen smiled and asked softly: \u201cCan you bandage me? It\u2019s hard to do it with one hand.\u201d\u201c\u2026Oh.\u201d Chu Yin looked at him, hesitated for two seconds, and finally took out a small square towel from her pocket.She walked over and kicked the stone beside her foot, \u201cSit down.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s heartbeat began to beat faster as he obediently sat down.Chu Yin sat next to him, lifted his blood-soaked clothes, and saw that the wound on his arm was a deep cut, like it was poked by a tree branch. There were wood chips stuck in his flesh.\u201c\u2026looks painful,\u201d Chu Yin pursed her lips, \u201cI\u2019d better wash it with water first.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s gaze only fell on her face and not on his wounds.Chu Yin unscrewed the water bottle in her bag. She wasn\u2019t careful and the water fell abruptly.Lu Zhen still stared at her.Chu Yin washed the wound, took the square scarf, and planned to bandage it.But as soon as she raised her eyes, she saw Lu Zhen\u2019s dark pupils, full of light.\u201cDon\u2019t look.\u201d Chu Yin frowned at him.Lu Zhen should look away but today he just blinked and smiled.Lu Zhen was waiting.He wanted to see how long she could tolerate it? When would she give up and use her powers to \u2018kill\u2019 him?Chu Yin was flustered by the intensity of his gaze so she roughly covered his face with her hands. \u201cI said not to look!\u201dLu Zhen blinked, his eyelashes lightly touched her palm.Chu Yin fiercely ordered: \u201cClose your eyes.\u201dLu Zhen pursed his smile and finally closed his eyes obediently.Chu Yin put the square towel around his arm and squeezed it hard. When she heard the dog man\u2019s painful cry, she smiled with satisfaction.She wasn\u2019t kind enough to help him bandage \u2013 she can just break this smelly arm!After the bandage, Chu Yin was about to get up, but suddenly was held by the hand again.Lu Zhen looked at her closely: \u201cAre you angry?\u201dChu Yin stared back at his pupils and finally understood his intentions.\u2014Dog man is testing her golden finger!Chu Yin gently clenched her hand on her side, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath: \u201cNo.\u201dYou don\u2019t have any killing intention, you don\u2019t want to kill him, you don\u2019t want to kill him.I can bear it, I can bear it, I can bear it, I can bear it.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes.Probably the deserted forest gave him the courage.In a sudden moment, the two people\u2019s breathing slightly intertwined. The taste of peppermint and unspeakable sweetness mixed together.Although Lu Zhen had a plan, his brain didn\u2019t listen as his nerves got numbed.Looking at her porcelain white skin and long eyelashes trembling in anger, Lu Zhen seemingly felt he was drowning in the air. His heartbeat was out of proportion.It was just a few seconds kiss. Chu Yin glared at him, grabbing his collar: \u201cYou \u2013\u201cShe\u2019s now raging war against Lu Zhen!But Lu Zhen only raised his hand and gently plucked a leaf from the top of her head.\u201cI was wrong.\u201dHe kissed the fallen leaves softly.He\u2019s now a believer, willing to sacrifice himself to the gods.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The extra hours he stole with greed were enough to motivate him to continue living.Chu Yin patted the dirt on her butt, raised her eyes, and glanced at Lu Zhen.An inexplicable atmosphere floated around. Lu Zhen\u2019s expression was gentle in the dimming light.\u201cThere are no bad guys anymore. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dThe people under him knew what to do. Now that the people on both sides have collided head-on, starting today, their shaky masks were finally destroyed. Everything would be different.Chu Yin\u2019s heart suddenly jumped. Lu Zhen\u2019s tone made her realize\u2026 that he really came to protect her.She raised her head and looked at Lu Zhen: \u201cRecently, is the person following me\u2026your hired guards?\u201dAlthough Chu Yin seldom went out of school and could only detect it occasionally, she was aware of the existence of someone following her.She began to wonder if this person\u2019s purpose was to peep or to stalk, but for some time, Chu Yin didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable. The other party was professional, not affecting her life nor committed any improper behaviors. Just like the day she went out to buy shoes, the other party was silently escorting her.Lu Zhen sent someone\u2026 to protect her?Why?Does he know she will be in danger? Where does the danger come from?She was just an ordinary high school student, who had made fun of people\u2019s lives. Who would want to harm her?Chu Yin originally thought that the greatest danger in the world was the person in front of her, but now she realized it might be\u2026not.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, watching her silently.Chu Yin tentatively asked, \u201cLu Zhen, do you know who came to harm me today?\u201dLu Zhen did not answer and only stared at her closely \u2013 She had already touched the lid of the small box of truth, but Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t dare help her open it.The young man\u2019s eyes deeply gazed at her. When Chu Yin\u2019s eyes met his, she felt a sense of familiarity.She was taken by that familiar look and recalled something from her previous life.Has this danger existed in her previous life?The night where Lu Zhen took her life was the most dangerous. She was even forced to stay with Lu Zhen until she died.Chu Yin frowned and closed her eyes to recall the small details.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t disturb her. He reached out to help her wave away the flying insectsSuddenly, Chu Yin opened her eyes \u2013She remembered that on that day in her previous life, she met two groups of people who wanted to take her away.She escaped the first time, and by the second time, Lu Zhen caught her.Originally, she thought it was Lu Zhen\u2019s subordinates who were not good at handling affairs, but now she realized another possibility\u2026 What if the first group of people was not Lu Zhen\u2019s? Who did she face back then?Chu Yin\u2019s head hurt a little, her eyebrows frowning tighter and tighter. A faint feeling of missing important details flooded her brain. She almost wanted to knock her head.Lu Zhen raised his hand. His expression was gentle as he rubbed her temples: \u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dChu Yin suddenly stretched out her hand and grasped Lu Zhen\u2019s wrist.Lu Zhen\u2019s fingers trembled.Her delicate palm pressed Lu Zhen\u2019s wrist.He subconsciously held his breath. \u201cYou..\u201d\u201cLu Zhen.\u201d When she called his name, Lu Zhen\u2019s voice tensed: \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dChu Yin pressed her lips but didn\u2019t know what to say.There was unreasonable anxiety in her heart. For a moment, she even hoped that the person in front of her was Lu Zhen from her previous life so that she could ask all the secrets she didn\u2019t know.But in the end, she just collapsed in frustration, took back her hands, and turned around: \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter. She can still find it in the script.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d Lu Zhen said.Lu Zhen accompanied her until the exit of the wild forest and stopped.Chu Yin walked a little farther to find that he wasn\u2019t following her, and turned around: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLu Zhen smiled and looked at her: \u201cI can\u2019t go out with you.\u201dHe had come secretly.If he could, he wanted to save from this whirlpool. Because of her power, she could live happily and freely outside the control of the world.Don\u2019t be tortured by the world and just escape, okay?She isn\u2019t his \u2018moonlight\u2019She is the sun of his life.Chu Yin was slightly startled when she heard the teacher calling the names of each student.After a while, Song Zhaolin\u2019s loud voice rang, calling her name.Chu Yin had to leave.Lu Zhen stood under a tree a few meters away, with Chu Yin\u2019s silk towel wrapped around his arm, smiling and waving: \u201cProtect yourself, then\u2026wait for me.\u201dHe was ready this time. Everything will be over soon.Chu Yin squeezed her fingers, suppressing all doubts. She turned and left.The moment she walked out of the woods, she glanced back.The young man smiled at her from a distance, then turned and disappeared among the trees.Something big will happen.\u2026\u201cTeacher! Chu Yin is gone!\u201dSong Zhaolin yelled in panic and everyone around him panicked.\u201cWhat to do! Help \u2013 Ah!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the funeral? I\u2019m here.\u201dSong Zhaolin quickly turned around, exclaiming in surprise, \u201cYou scared us to death, Where did you go?\u201dChu Yin pointed at a small pavilion: \u201cAnswered math problems.\u201dSong Zhaolin touched his head: \u201cHuh? Why didn\u2019t I see you just now?\u201dChu Yin lied to him without giving a detailed explanation.Her eyes passed over the small shop without a trace. The old woman who sold water was no longer there. The purpose was to specifically block her. Chu Yin did not mention the fact that she almost got kidnapped.The students sighed.\u201cDamn, Sister Yin deserves to be my Sister Yin. She even studies in this kind of place!\u201d\u201cSenior year of high school is all about having this kind of spirit!\u201dChu Yin: *ashamed of it*It was a false alarm. The headteacher finally breathed a sigh of relief, and then led a large group of students down the mountain.\u201c\u2013Oh, yes, I saw a person who looks like Brother Zhen!\u201d Song Zhaolin said, \u201cbut I must have seen it wrong. Brother Zhen went to a different province for inspection two days ago. How can he come and climb the mountain? Hahaha.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyebrows slightly raised.He went to investigate plus he couldn\u2019t show himself in public when he came in this mountain just now. Lu Zhen was deliberately guarding her against someone.Song Zhaolin said naively, \u201cBut I am quite envious of the passerby, who can look like Brother Zhen. Why can\u2019t I be like him!\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Chu Yin often saw Lu Zhen in the news about his development projects that earned high profits.After the young man turned and left that day, he indeed became the best.But Chu Yin couldn\u2019t help wonder, does the 17-year-old Lu Zhen have such a strong business ability? According to this period, Lu Zhen shouldn\u2019t be able to manage his family properties well.Although there was no more detail in the script, Chu Yin could imagine the scene of the raging smoke in a few simple sentences.Huiwen\u2019s study life was calm as water.The new selection of the School\u2019s Flower and Apollo had begun again.Song Zhaolin said: \u201cSister Yin, this year you should be the School\u2019s Apollo, while I defend the title of the School\u2019s Flower. Do you think it\u2019s appropriate?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dSince Lu Zhen didn\u2019t come to school for a long time, and the newly enrolled high school students had never seen the rumored School\u2019s Apollo yet.In the voting, under the incitement of senior high school students, they voted only for a specific person.After the results were announced, Chu Yin held the title of \u201cSchool\u2019s Flower and School\u2019s Apollo\u201dShe was speechless.She passed the title of School\u2019s Flower to Song Zhaolin last year. She didn\u2019t expect to win two titles on her head this year.But today was different from the past. She was not afraid to add ten more titles.No one dared to trouble her anymore.The high school year was boring. Chu Yin stayed in school every day. The only way to self-regulate was to read the script.The kidnapping incident that day never happened again which relieved her.Because she was watching the script diligently, she found that Lu Linyuan\u2019s old pervert was still active.Hehehe, her sledgehammer is ready to be used at any time.Other than that, life seems extremely peaceful.But\u2026unpredictable variables often happen on calm days.Not long after, when the winter came, Grandfather Lu, the ruler of the Lu family, became seriously ill.This seemed to be some kind of signal.From then on, the Lu family officially faced a turnover of power.\u2026Lu Linyuan walked out of the basement and slowly put the leather gloves on himself.A batch of goods had just been inspected and the condition was good. The quality and caliber of the bullet were all excellent, and Lu Linyuan was fairly satisfied.Same as before, these activities should be discreet. The volume was much smaller than before. Fortunately, he only had to deal with few people.The confidant walked over from the side and approached Lu Linyuan\u2019s ears: \u201cThe old man woke up at three o\u2019clock this afternoon, .\u201dLu Linyuan snorted, \u201cThe old thing is quite strong.\u201dIt\u2019s better to die cleanly than to witness the people in his own roof kill each other. Would he die of anger?\u201cWhere is Azhen?\u201d Lu Linyuan asked.\u201c\u2026The old man woke up and called the lawyer. The young master and the lawyer talked for a long time. Most of it were about inheritance rights.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s expression suddenly turned gloomy.The pressure Lu Zhen put on him was even greater than what his elder brother gave him back then.His voice was soft but with a gloomy feeling like a cold-blooded animal, he asked, \u201cWhat about the little girl?\u201d\u201cShe never left school, I\u2026\u201dLu Linyuan suddenly kicked him to the ground.Then his (LL) toes fell between his legs and rolled it hard. \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear excuses.\u201dThe man cried out in pain: \u201cYes-! Mr. Lu\u201d\u201cYou let her escape last time, huh?\u201d Lu Linyuan pressed his foot harder as he softly said, \u201cNow do you know what to do?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d After Lu Linyuan had done enough torment, he let go of his feet, tidied up his leather gloves, and recovered his calm aura.\u201cLet\u2019s go and meet Little Song.\u201dThe news from the Lu family was simply overwhelming.#Lu family\u2019s only successor Lu Zhen, will soon take over the position##Lu family\u2019s heir is still a minor, his uncle will be the regent?##War to seize power?! The battle for power between the second and third generation of top wealthiest people#Chu Yin, even if she didn\u2019t read the script, could still see the news of Lu Zhen from various channels.As soon as Grandfather Lu fell, Lu Linyuan began to grab the family property. This world deserves to be a novel of blood and wisdom. The villains had all these plans.She said before the Lu Zhen wasn\u2019t ready for power because of his minor age \u2013 but was the other party, Lu Linyuan, considered an adult too\u00a01?However, Grandfather Lu wouldn\u2019t survive this winter\u2026 Lu Zhen should be uncomfortable. After all, the few relatives around him had died, had gone crazy, had seriously gotten ill, and had too many evil minions.Looking at this, Lu Zhen was a bit pitiful.But these things in the Lu family had nothing to do with her.Even if Chu Yin usually eats melon seeds, she never thought that these things would have any trouble with her.In the memory of her last life, she had not been exposed to any information about Lu family\u2019s power taking.This week, Song Zhaolin appeared worried.Chu Yin remembered the contact between Song Yanchuan and Lu Linyuan, wondering if Song Zhaolin, the little fool, finally noticed something. She sighed, not knowing how to comfort him for a while.It\u2019s better for little fools to be happy, and leave the distress to the adults.She touched Song Zhaolin\u2019s head: \u201cDon\u2019t think too much.\u201dSong Zhaolin sighed: \u201cI\u2019m not thinking much.\u201dChu Yin thought for a while, pulled out a set of math papers, and put it in front of him: \u201cThink about this.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026\u201d\u00a0Thank you, I am indeed comforted.At the weekend, several of Chu Yin\u2019s roommates went home one after another, while she stayed at school.The students of Huiwen were all from the city, so the dormitory corridors on weekends were empty, and there were almost no people.Chu Yin implemented her study habits even on weekends.Early on, she had breakfast, then she did a listening set in the dormitory, and after that, she took the time to make a set of papers.By noon, the cleaning aunt went to eat, and the building became quiet.Chu Yin suddenly heard footsteps coming from the corridor at this moment.She didn\u2019t care at first but when the footsteps stopped at the door of her dormitory, Chu Yin raised her head.\u201cBoom boom boom.\u201d The door of the dormitory was knocked.Chu Yin put on her slippers and walked to the door of the dormitory \u2013 occasionally the cleaning aunt would knock on the door to send back personal belongings in the corridor.She had just walked two steps when the phone on the desktop suddenly rang.Chu Yin reached for the phone and opened the message.It turned out to be a message from Lu Zhen.He said: [Don\u2019t open the door]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because there was no one staying in the dormitory, she could lock the door anytime, and now, Chu Yin was grateful for this situation.But\u2026how come the troublemaker is here again?Last time she was chased in the wild woods, and this time it followed her to the dormitory?Since Chu Yin didn\u2019t respond for a long time, Lu Zhen sent a few more messages, and finally made a voice call.\u201cHello?\u201d Chu Yin answered, lowering the volume subconsciously.The door was knocked again\u2014\u201ddong dong dong\u201d, which was heavier than before, accompanied by the sounds of pushing.Lu Zhen\u2019s voice came, sounding eager: \u201cAre you in the dormitory?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t open the door,\u201d Lu Zhen said, \u201cIt will be resolved soon.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cOh\u2026\u201dShe could solve it herself.Lu Zhen heard the slight breathing sound turned into an electric current,\u00a0 \u201cAre you afraid?\u201dChu Yin looked at the door.When the third knocks came, they became more forceful and stronger.I\u2019m not afraid\u2026this scene is just strange.After the knock on the door suddenly stopped, it was followed by a muffled sound of a fist hitting the outside door. After a time, the sound of heavy objects being dragged away gradually disappeared.\u201cIt\u2019s a little scary now,\u201d She said.Lu Zhen chuckled softly: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid.\u201dChu Yin snorted, \u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201dOn the call, Lu Zhen was standing outside the ward while the lawyer on the other side was preparing internal documents. The corridor was full of bodyguards in black. All of them were his bodyguards.Lu Zhen had been busy meeting visitors from all sides during this time. If the time comes that Master Lu would pass away, he could predict what earth-shaking events would take place. The general public always had something to say about the future successor of the Lu Family.He experienced all of these so it was easy for him to fix the mess cleanly. He knew exactly what would happen next and predict all the movements behind Lu Linyuan. The only variable was the person on the phone.But she still kept a nonchalant tone, telling him that she wasn\u2019t afraid.Lu Zhen\u2019s heart suddenly softened: \u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dChu Yin put her ears to the door and listened. She then asked, \u201cLu Zhen, how do you know someone\u2019s coming after me?\u201dLu Zhen was silent for two seconds before he said, \u201cMy people are outside.\u201dAs expected by Chu Yin.The successive incidents and Lu Zhen\u2019s protective attitude made her realized that she couldn\u2019t avoid the affairs any longer. She would eventually get involved in it. It was like some kind of fate that she couldn\u2019t escape.She had speculation but there wasn\u2019t any conclusive evidence for it.After all, she couldn\u2019t understand the motive behind kidnapping her? What benefit would the other party get? Aside from having no money, no one knew about her golden fingers.Chu Yin hesitated for a few seconds before vaguely saying, \u201cLu Zhen, do you know that your uncle\u2026is different from what he was showing in the surface, right?\u201dThe person she doubted the most was Lu Linyuan.Lu Zhen raised his eyes and saw Lu Linyuan walk from the end of the corridor. He asked Chu Yin, \u201cHow is he different?\u201dChu Yin snorted in her heart and thought that this young master was still a piece of white paper\u00a01\u201cJust be careful of him.\u201dNow she had to leave it all to the male lead\u2019s halo. The grievances of the villains were as deep as the sea. She didn\u2019t want to get involved too much.\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Zhen smiled and hung up the phone.Lu Linyuan walked to the ICU room and watched the Old Man Lu lying on the hospital bed through the glass. His expression was very painful: \u201cDad was fine before, how could he suddenly be this ill\u2026\u201dLu Zhen was silent.His people surrounded the entire floor, while Lu Linyuan\u2019s people stood behind him. They faced each other in silence.Lu Zhen looked at Lu Linyuan: \u201cUncle, let\u2019s talk about the equity issue.\u201dLu Linyuan: \u201cAh Zhen, what\u2019s the hurry? Dad is still\u2026\u201dLu Zhen smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s what Grandpa wants. \u201cLu Linyuan raised his eyebrows, and then slowly laughed: \u201cReally? Okay.\u201d\u2026Lu Linyuan walked out of the hospital building and got inside the car waiting outside.He lit a cigarette and asked the man next to him, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\u201cThey intercepted.\u201dLu Linyuan raised his hand and knocked his head on the back of the driver\u2019s seat with a bang. The metal sheet on the back of the chair injured the person instantly, and blood trickled down his forehead.\u201cTrash, you can\u2019t even handle a little girl.\u201d Lu Linyuan said coldly.He never felt that there was anything wrong with using women. It was right for businessmen to take effective measures.To be honest, Lu Zhen surprised him very much. The little nephew, who he thought was completely dependent on him, was now going against him.When looking at Lu Zhen\u2019s face, he recalled the memory of him pressing his elder brother\u2019s head. A twisted desire to torture surged into his heart again.The future of seeing his nephew\u2019s shocked and painful face, he couldn\u2019t wait to tell him the truth. Lu Linyuan took a long cigarette, suppressing the desire for destruction in his heart.\u201cContact Song Yanchuan.\u201d He said.\u2026Song Yanchun knew that the Lu Family\u2019s recent power change would get him involved secretly. Lu Linyuan would surely come for him for help.\u201cThese are the benefits I can give you, Little Song, how about it?\u201d Lu Linyuan looked at him in a cloud of smoke.Song Yanchuan also lit a cigarette.How about it?\u00a0His chips were even higher than Song Yanchuan\u2019s expectations, so it\u2019s hard not to be moved.\u201cWhat about the conditions?\u201dLu Linyuan smiled: \u201cYour brother and Chu Yin are in the same class. Don\u2019t these classmates usually come out to play?\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s eyebrows jumped.\u00a0How can this perverted man always think of perverted stuff? Really, go for the little girl?He frowned: \u201cWhat can she do?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s very useful,\u201d Lu Linyuan smiled meaningfully: \u201cI have succeeded once. I don\u2019t mind succeeding the second time.\u201dSucceeded once? Although he knew that Lu Linyuan was evil, Song Yanchuan was still shocked by the huge amount of information he got.His heart shook.\u00a0Can this kid, Lu Zhen, defeat this old pervert in front of him? Although Lu Zhen is stable, as if he can foresee, heaven can\u2019t always favor him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Every small decision was of utmost importance. He was now making the final decision\u2014Who is he betting on?Song Zhaolin heard the sound and jumped out to him: \u201cBrother, you\u2019re back?\u201dSong Yanchuan gave an \u201cum\u201d and glanced at him: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dSong Zhaolin scratched his head and said, \u201cCooking.\u201dSong Yanchuan\u2019s eyebrows raised. \u201cWhere\u2019s the housekeeper?\u201d\u201cWell, I see you working hard every day so I want to personally cook for you\u2026\u201dSong Yanchuan:\u00a0 \u201cAnd then poison me?\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s heart was broken: \u201cHow could you say that?\u201dAlthough he said mean things, he placed down his bag, rolled up his sleeves, and went to the kitchen. \u201cLet me taste the food you cooked.\u201dA plate of scrambled eggs with burnt tomatoes, a plate of burnt chicken wings with black coke, and a plate of black unidentified food.\u00a0What kind of dishes are these?Song Yanchuan: \u201cYou want to fucking poison me\u2026\u201dSong Zhaolin put the oil into the pan, took the spatula, and said confidently: \u201cBrother, believe me, I can do this!\u201dA few seconds later.The oil ragingly jumped from the pan and into Song Zhaolin\u2019s hand. He subconsciously turned and hid.Song Yanchuan took over the job of cooking with a blank face: \u201cIf you want me to save the ingredients, get out of the kitchen.\u201dSong Zhaolin went out.Song Yanchuan finished cooking, then glanced at Song Zhaolin\u2019s back jumping up and down, and suddenly smiled.He forgot something.A boy this age should be like his silly younger brother Song Zhaolin. A person who is similar to Lu Zhen who thinks deep will grow up like that old pervert.He (SY) had been heartless ever since he was a child. As an elder brother, he shouldn\u2019t let his younger brother down.\u2026Lu\u2019s board meeting.The board of chairman was in ICU, so the meeting was presided over by the secretary of the board of directors.The two forces were battling over the equity decision. The board of directors finally reached a delicate balance, after a long time, in the proportion of equity.Lu Zhen had 1% more than Lu Linyuan. Once Mr. Lu\u2019s equity was transferred to him, Lu Zhen could act as the actual person in charge to take over the control of the group. Lu Linyuan was at a disadvantage.Chu Yin could occasionally see these rights struggles in the script. Lu Zhen seemed to proceed smoothly, much better than she had imagined. Lu Linyuan didn\u2019t seem to have the capability to take the Lu family from him.After the last incident of the person knocking on her dorm room, Chu Yin didn\u2019t encounter any strange things.In the future, the plot would develop towards the peak of the domineering president Lu Zhen.She gradually relaxed.\u2014Until the next weekend.Chu Yin suddenly unlocked a blank script.The glowing pages were spread out, but there were no words on them.Chu Yin vaguely felt that something was wrong when she encountered this situation for the first time and poked the system: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201dXueji issued a prompt tone: \u201cDing! Touched the core plot! Ding Ding Ding!\u201dChu Yin was stupefied: \u201cCore plot?\u201dBefore she had time to think about it, the door of the dormitory was knocked again. \u201cDong Dong Dong.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s heart jumped and realized that something big would happen in the script. She wouldn\u2019t the important plot in the script since it\u2019s a blank paper now!She glanced at the phone subconsciously. Lu Zhen didn\u2019t send her a message this time.Chu Yin had an inexplicable panic, and an indescribable sense of familiarity came to her heart.She knocked on the system: \u201cHow do I have access at the core plot?\u201dXueji: \u201cYou need to consume the maximum permissions held in the host account to unlock. If you do not use the permissions after unlocking, the permissions will not be refunded.\u201dChu Yin hadn\u2019t had the time to reply to anything yet when the door was knocked again. Two very soft sounds.She suddenly looked over and thought that she would use her authority to kill the man outside the door, which was too bad\u2014But at this moment, a voice rang outside the dormitory door.\u201cChu Yin, open the door.\u201d\u2014Lu Zhen\u2019s voice.Chu Yin suddenly opened her eyes.She walked slowly to the door of the dormitory and asked aloud: \u201cLu Zhen?\u201dYeah.\u201d Lu Zhen said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026to pick you up.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The group chased her until she escaped, but she still couldn\u2019t avoid the danger as she was taken away by Lu Zhen.The reason why it was the core plot, was because\u2026 After the timeline was advanced, the plot advanced to this day?Chu Yin\u2019s fingers trembled: \u201cWhy?\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes across the door: \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026someone will come after you later, I want to\u2026\u201d\u2026put you in a safe place.But before he could finish speaking, the restraint was pressed down again, and the nerves in his brain were strained again, which turned him pale with pain.When Lu Zhen recovered, the door in front of him opened a crack.Indeed, Lu Zhen was the only one standing outside the door.He didn\u2019t look good. His clothes were slightly messy. His face was pale and sweaty.There were series of footsteps on the stairs from the distance.Lu Zhen frowned and held Chu Yin\u2019s wrist, \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201dAll the people under Lu Linyuan\u2019s hands were involved in the underworld. He doesn\u2019t know mercy in this aspect.The sound of footsteps in the stairwell was disorderly, accompanied by the panic cry of the dormitory keeper.In the chaos, Lu Zhen\u2019s palm was hot and firm. He pulled her away from the crown and ran out with her all the way to the car waiting outside.He took off his coat and put it on Chu Yin. The little girl held her arms and asked him calmly, \u201cWhere are we going?\u201dThe situation was different from the previous life.Although Chu Yin hadn\u2019t unlocked the script, she instinctively judged that the other group was more dangerous than Lu Zhen after the previous two events.In the fast-speeding car, Lu Zhen looked at the night sky, and then touched her head: \u201cYou\u2019ll know soon.\u201dThe car stopped outside a suburban community. Lu Zhen took Chu Yin as they quietly entered a residential building.Lu Zhen took her to the sixth floor, which was \u201cold and small\u201d, with dim corridors and small advertisement posters pasted outside.It was difficult to connect this kind of place with Lu Zhen. Lu Zhen opened the door with the key and lead her in.\u201cWait until the night ends.\u201dAfter a night, everything would be fixed.\u201cThere are people with me outside the door and downstairs. Don\u2019t be afraid.\u201dThe lamp on the ceiling was also old and yellow, and the light it cast was dim. It shone on Lu Zhen\u2019s face. Chu Yin found that his expression was calm.He\u2019s completely different from his previous life.The answer might be on the blank page of the plot.Lu Zhen glanced at her one last time.He couldn\u2019t explain, the young man who knew nothing and lost everything, had no choice but to take her away, lock her up, and take her to wherever he went.But this time, he had the ability to hide her before the long night begins, and then solve all the problems alone.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Lu Zhen could only have this little time.He turned and walked towards the door. Chu Yin looked at his back and suddenly shouted: \u201cLu Zhen\u2013\u201cShe actually had a lot to ask, but when she glanced at his stiff face, she swallowed it back.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll wait for you\u2026 just for one night,\u201d Chu Yin hugged her arms, \u201cDon\u2019t bail out on me.\u201dShe fully realized that there were many hidden secrets in her previous life.So after he comes back, they should talk about everything cleanly.If one made a mistake, one must repent. If one had been misunderstood, one must justify itself.Then they could\u2026 let go of everything, walk out of the past, and move forward.Lu Zhen immediately had infinite courage.The road ahead was a long night, and at the end of the night, his god was carrying a lamp\u00a01.He laughed: \u201cOkay.\u201d\u2026After Lu Zhen left, Chu Yin knocked on the system.The blank page opened again.She only had one single permission, which was very precious. Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to use it recklessly.But what if there was an answer on this page?Those things that she didn\u2019t know in her previous life\u2026she could find the answers here.Xueji: \u201cDo you want to unlock the core plot of the blank page?\u201dAfter a long time, Chu Yin nodded: \u201cSolution.\u201dAs soon as the voice fell, there were lines of writing on the blank page. Chu Yin looked at it word by word, and her pupils shrank.Seizing power was harder than she thought. But what was even more frightening was\u2026\u3010Lu Linyuan used his firepower to suppress Lu Zhen. In front of pure evil, the boy, who was like a white paper, had no power to fight back. Lu Linyuan evilly smirked as he recounted to Lu Zhen everything he had done. He killed Lu Zhen\u2019s purpose and spirit in just those words.\u3011The amount of information was too great.Chu Yin\u2019s fingers squeezed tightly, took a deep breath, and continued to read down.This time, she almost broke her finger.\u3010He intended to repeat his old tricks to Chu Yin again \u2013 torture her, imprison her, brainwash her, and turn her into the next remote control to restrain Lu Zhen. Just like what he did to Su Yumin\u2026\u3011Chu Yin felt like she couldn\u2019t breathe.She didn\u2019t know this happened in her last life until this moment.She didn\u2019t feel relieved. She just thought it was absurd.This was Lu Linyuan? Couldn\u2019t he use some advanced methods? What else was this old pervert expect from holding a woman hostage?But Chu Yin also understood that Lu Linyuan could completely do these things.This garbage world, this garbage villain, and this garbage story\u2019s conflict.But Lu Zhen was still threatened by this inferior method.There were still many mysteries between her and Lu Zhen. The dog man had not yet fully explained it to her, Chu Yin now knew what she was going to do.\u2014The world gave her the \u201cright to revise\u201d, which was to correct the injustice.This evil man was nothing.This was in, a true sense, life-changing.\u201cDo you want to use the permission to change the script?\uff08Warm reminder: Because the situation can greatly change after the modification, the system can not predict the random events.)Chu Yin: \u201cUse it.\u201dHow could she not use it? Could she make Lu Linyuan, a dog man, be happy?Don\u2019t even think about happiness.After Chu Yin cut off a section of a paragraph, an extremely sour and refreshing feeling overtook her \u2013 she knew that these plots that had tortured them in the past life would not happen again.She grabbed the light pen and wrote down a new plotline by word:\u3010Lu Linyuan failed. He couldn\u2019t say what he wanted to say and everything he wanted to do was unsuccessful. He couldn\u2019t get everything he wanted to pursue. In the second half of his life, he would pay for all the evil things he did and spend his life in prison.\u3011Chu Yin threw the pen. Hehe.I can also write a new story for you when you\u2019re in jail, and I can make it into a series.In the alley outside the city, the scene is very chaotic.After several gunshots, the situation was temporarily brought under control.How did it get to this point? No one knew.But from the beginning, the negotiations from both people on both sides weren\u2019t optimistic. This resulted in fighting.Today, the two sides had completely revealed themselves.Lu Linyuan\u2019s people were more ruthless and even more desperate than Lu Zhen\u2019s professional bodyguards, so they took the initiative.Lu Zhen was crushed under the street lamp, watching Lu Linyuan indifferently walk towards him.This scene was exactly the same as in the previous life. What was different was his state of mind.Next, Lu Linyuan would smile gently, tell him everything, and destroy his spirit. From that moment on, the rules of the world would suddenly become clear, and the \u201chuman design\u201d began to collide with his independent consciousness.But now, Lu Zhen\u2019s heart was calm. He quietly just waited for him to speak.Then tell Lu Linyuan, he knew all about it.\u2026But things didn\u2019t seem right.\u201cAzhen, do you know, actually\u2026\u201d Lu Linyuan smiled, but he oddly couldn\u2019t speak.\u201cI\u2026those\u2026 are me\u2026\u201d Lu Linyuan\u2019s expression changed.Lu Zhen stared at him for a long while, then suddenly smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You even considred it as your piece of work.\u201d\u201cYou held my mother hostage, leading to my father\u2019s car accident?\u201d\u201cAnd you\u2019re ready to torture the next person to get the same results you want?\u201dLu Zhen learned everything in his previous life.\u00a0 After his spirit and motivation were destroyed, he ran away in a hurry, like a dead beast. When he found the last person he could protect, he caught her in his arms, tightly clinger to her.But Lu Zhen, in this current life, spoke lightly. Because no matter how intense the shock and despair, after a single lifetime, it would fade.The shock in Lu Linyuan\u2019s eyes was very similar to him in his previous life.Lu Zhen smiled. \u201cBut it\u2019s a pity \u2013 Grandpa is not ill and is in good health. My mother has been transferred to the hospital and is receiving psychological treatment. And\u2026my person\u00a01, you can\u2019t touch her.\u201d\u201cUncle, there is a better place in the world for you. Go there.\u201dAfter speaking, the police sirens sounded not far away, piercing the entire night sky.From the beginning to the end, he did all these steps by step. The so-called Lu family\u2019s struggle for power was only a way to push him out of power.Since he had already returned, he would not give Lu Linyuan another opportunity to take advantage of it.A larger group of people emerged from the dark, surrounding him, and the people on Lu Linyuan\u2019s side resisted with difficulty but were eventually disarmed.Lu Linyuan\u2019s face became a little distorted, and suddenly he raised his gun at Lu Zhen.\u201cAzhen, are you so sure of winning? Are you sure you can keep that little girl?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cThe materials Song Yanchuan provided me, I will use it well.\u201dLu Linyuan suddenly realized that Song Yanchuan, that bastard, was also on Lu Zhen\u2019s side.For people like him, the sense of failure was the biggest torment.Lu Linyuan\u2019s face twisted for a few seconds, then he aimed at Lu Zhen\u2019s heart and pulled the trigger\u2014\u201cAZhen, then die with me!\u201dHe didn\u2019t see the seconds before Lu Zhen raised his gun. After two startling sounds, Lu Linyuan\u2019s hands fell soft as blood trickled down.\u201cI forgot to say.\u201d Lu Zhen took the gun and watched Lu Linyuan being thrown to the ground by his men.He whispered, \u201cIn my previous life, I used you as an aim target.\u201dThe police car came, flashing red and blue alternately.The reason why the destruction of the factory last time was suppressed was that it was not the right time. If it was suppressed, Lu Linyuan would doubt and would start investigating him. The sexual abuse towards underage, illegal business, and even drug trade was now gone.Everything is over\u2026Lu Zhen casually threw the gun he had just picked on the ground.There was a frivolity of unreality.Probably his god was protecting him, so everything went well.He needed to go back and find her.Lu Zhen\u2019s fingertips curled up lightly, and in such a chaotic night, the dusty excitement and longing rose in his heart.If she knows all this, will she understand?They can still\u2026But at this moment, Lu Linyuan, who was sitting in the police car in handcuffs, suddenly began to laugh.He laughed so violently that his body curled, bursting into tears.\u201cAzhen, you really used a good method, I\u2019m ashamed, but\u2026\u201d\u201cThe person you want to protect may be burnt now~ Hahahahaha\u2026\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s pupils shrank suddenly.\u2026Everything was in a trance.When the smoke billowed, Chu Yin had just woken up from her sleep.The fire had burned the room.The old houses were all made of wood. The floor was wooden and all the furniture was made of wood. The tongue of fire quickly burned the entire sofa.Chu Yin covered her mouth, knocking the system violently: \u201cQuickly, quickly script\u2013\u201cThis dog world!!!The system unlocked the script for her, and Chu Yin worked hard to read it, but suddenly she was stupefied.\u2013No.There was no kind of plot.The house was about to burn, but there was nothing written in the script.Chu Yin pulled off the pillow towel, wet it, and covered herself with it. As she moved to the door, she asked Xueji: \u201cHow come there\u2019s no such kind of plot in the script?!\u201d\u201cAnswer the host, this is a derivative plot after modifying the paragraph. It is the dying blow of the villain and belongs to the logical self consistent part of the plot of the original book. It is not within the scope of system prediction. \u201cThe air was full of burnt smells. Chu Yin tightly covered her mouth and nose, lowering herself, \u201cI can write another sentence by myself!\u201dXueji\u2019s voice was regrettable but cold: \u201cUnfortunately, the host does not have a single-sentence permission at this time. There is only one-word permission left in your account.\u201dA single word.\u2026But there was no plot, what word could she change?Chu Yin forced herself not to panic.The door of the room was not closed, and the whole living room was in flames. This was the sixth floor. The air conditioner outside the old building was sparse. She would die if she jumped down.Chu Yin needed to move towards the gate.With such a big fire, people outside didn\u2019t respond. They may have been disposed of.Under the high temperature, the window glass began to crack. Chu Yin didn\u2019t know how hot the room was becoming, but she had difficulty breathing and her skin was burning.The distance from here to the door was far away. What was even more frightening was that if the people outside had been dealt with, then the door must have been locked from the outside.Damn.Chu Yin was almost out of strength.In a daze, she thought, probably this was her life as the short-lived Bai Yueguang\u2026 The male lead had solved the core plot, the villain fell, and her role value was over.\u2026What the hell was this?She hadn\u2019t had the chance to walk up to Lu Zhen, tell him face to face that this old day\u00a02\u00a0remembered everything, and that he should atone for all his sins.Amidst the sound of cracking and burning, Chu Yin heard the horn of the fire truck coming from a distance\u2026And the next moment, the door that was incomparably far away, was violently broken down.A person rushed in desperately.\u201cYoung Master!!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t go there! The beam is about to collapse!\u201dThe flames singed on Lu Zhen\u2019s clothes and jumped on his skin. Not even realizing it, he rushed towards Chu Yin.He finally understood.The rules of the world still wouldn\u2019t let him go.Even if he was born in the next lifetime, he was still under the rules of the world\u2026Since he can\u2019t help her\u2026The only solution is to die for her\u2026Lu Zhen rushed over from the sea of flames, threw himself on Chu Yin, and wrapped her tightly around his body.\u2026If the rules were still affecting him and if he was destined not to be with her.\u2026Then die. He was the biggest threat to her in this world.Because he loves her forever.Chu Yin laboriously opened her eyes, seeing Lu Zhen\u2019s blur silhouette.He rushed in through the door as the beams of the room gradually collapsed.\u201cYou\u2026go\u2026\u201dThe young man\u2019s arms were wide.\u00a0 For a moment, in this burning room, a cold kiss suddenly fell on her lips.In a few seconds, the beam finally smashed down. The sound of bone fracture being broken down seemed to roar in Chu Yin\u2019s mind.At the last moment, she heard the young man\u2019s hoarse voice.\u201cI love you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll give you your life back.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now it\u2019s reappearing in her dream.What did Lu Zhen say at the time?Chu Yin wandered in the dream. And for some reason, his voice suddenly became clear.It turned out that on that day when Lu Zhen leaned in to whisper in her ears, he said in a voice full of despair:\u201cYou can take my life anytime.\u201dHis voice was low and hoarse, overlapping with the voice of the young boy.\u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll give you your life back.\u201d\u201c!\u201dChu Yin immediately opened her eyes \u2013Lu Zhen was also reborn.This was her first thought when she woke up.Her pupils gradually gaining their focus. She slowly saw the pure white ceiling above her head.The smell of disinfectant floated in the air. The curtains were closed, and the winter sun shone through and warmly fell on her.Burning the house was probably Lu Linyuan\u2019s alternative plan. He knew there were chances he couldn\u2019t get Chu Yin, so if he failed, he could simply drive Lu Zhen mad.Chu Yin opened her eyes and stayed in a daze for a while.When Chu Shi came in from the outside, he found that she was awake and ran to the doctor with great excitement. Then he went to Chu Yin\u2019s bed and asked softly, \u201cHow is Yin Yin? Is there any pain?\u201dChu Yin hooked her lips and shook her head.Lu Zhen came in time and took her out in his arms. Chu Yin didn\u2019t get burnt, but her throat was severely swollen and painful because of the smoke she inhaled.After painfully swallowing her saliva, she asked softly, \u201cWhere\u2019s Lu Zhen?\u201dThe last time she saw Lu Zhen was when the ceiling collapsed in the fire. The sound of broken bones rang in her mind, making it unforgettable.Chu Shi\u2019s expression froze for a moment, got up to give way to the doctor, lowered his head, and said nothing.When he learned that Chu Yin was trapped in the fire, his mentality collapsed.Even if he wanted to rush to save her immediately, it was too late. Chu Shi hurriedly left the company.Two people were pulled out from the fire scene. Although Chu Yin\u2019s face was covered with ashes, when Chu Shi rushed to the stretcher, he found that her breathing was stable, and there was no big problem with her body. His heart fell with great relief.And the other person who was rescued\u2026When he saw Lu Zhen, he had completely lost consciousness. His entire back was bloody, and his bones were extremely distorted.Chu Shi heard someone say that as the beam of the house collapsed, Lu Zhen jumped on Chu Yin and used himself as a human wall to block all the things for Chu Yin.It took him a long time to digest this fact.Lu Zhen \u2013 the future successor of the Lu family, the wealthiest heir, it wasn\u2019t too much to say that he was a man worth thousands of gold. To save his sister\u2019s life, he sacrificed his.When Chu Yin woke up, Chu Shi repeatedly recalled the dream he had. He began to doubt deeply. Would such a person hurt his sister?The doctor performed a simple examination on Chu Yin. There was nothing wrong with her. \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, it\u2019s all over. You can go home after two days of recuperation.\u201dChu Yin nodded, \u201cThank you.\u201dSince Chu Shi did not answer her, it gave Chu Yin a bad feeling. She stretched out her hand, grabbed the doctor\u2019s hem, and asked, \u201cWhere is the person who came out of the fire with me\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh, that boy?\u201d The doctor looked at her gently and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, he saved your life. It\u2019s \u2013 don\u2019t think too much. Just take care of yourself first.\u201dIt was impossible not to think about it.How serious was his condition for the doctor to describe it as saving her life?Chu Yin now understood.She thought the wrong direction before, thinking that other special energy fluctuations would be someone who has special golden fingers like her. But now she suddenly realized that in addition to Goldfinger, she could be\u2026reborn just like her.Her thinking process before was wrong. She thought that the special energy fluctuation refers to him having a similar golden finger as her. But now she realized that besides the golden finger, Lu Zhen could be reborn like her.Lu Zhen also remembered all of them.\u201cSo, how is he?\u201d Chu Yin spoke a little bit laboriously.Chu Shi sighed, unable to lie in her bright gaze: \u201cLu Zhen\u2026 his spinal cord was severely damaged, causing his entire body to be paralyzed\u2026\u201dChu Yin stared at him motionlessly.Chu Shi replied in difficulty as if his throat was swollen: \u201cIn short, he\u2019s in a vegetative state.\u201dChu Yin closed her eyes.Her breathing was a little hot as though she was still in the fire.To compensate me in exchange for his life, who the hell made this tragic solution?Chu Shi held Chu Yin\u2019s hand and said in a warm voice, \u201cListen to the doctor, don\u2019t think much. Because of the status of the Lu family, the world\u2019s famous doctors will be transferred to Lu Zhen for treatment. Don\u2019t worry. \u201cChu Yin closed her eyes and nodded.But her long eyelashes were trembling. No one knew what she was thinking.\u2026The Lu Family had experienced another unprecedented turmoil.First, the two sides seized power and fought each other at night. Then one side went to prison and the other to the hospital.The heir became a vegetable, lying on the hospital bed and relying on equipment to survive.Grandfather Lu\u2019s\u2018 serious illness\u2019 was supposed to be fake, but all of a sudden, he fell ill.He didn\u2019t know if God would punish him for making his son go first. And now he dragged his only grandson to the gate of the dead.Seeing Lu Zhen lying in the ICU with pipes inserted in his body, his hair immediately turned white.The secretary next to him held on to the old man: \u201cMaster Lu, this is a crucial time to hold on! Young Master will surely wake up!\u201dAlthough Grandfather Lu was very old, his face became several decades older overnight.When Lu Zhen told him about his plan, he hesitated. The reason was that Lu Linyuan\u2019s performance over the past few decades has been too watertight and his ambition was not extreme.But it turned out that everything Lu Zhen told him came true one by one. Even he was shocked at how deep his young son took advantage of Lu\u2019s limelight.Lu Zhen was fierce. He single-handedly chopped down obstacles to his future.But if Grandfather Lu had known the price of this, he would rather let Lu Linyuan take over the company and let his grandson grow up safely.The girl Lu Zhen rescued\u2026He had nothing to say. The greatest self-restraint he had was not going to the Chu Family for trouble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His son and grandson were all put in great danger because of their woman.\u201cAre the medicine experts from the United States not here yet?\u201d\u201cThey will arrive tonight.\u201d\u201cWell, directly escort them and arrange for the best hotels.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u2026All the top and best doctors were gathered in Lu Zhen\u2019s ward.After studying his CT film for two days straight, the situation was still not optimistic.When there were few people, Chu Yin went downstairs and walked from his ward to the intensive care unit.Lu Zhen\u2019s ward was surrounded by layers of bodyguards, and she couldn\u2019t get through.Xueji: \u201cEverything is so familiar.\u201dChu Yin asked: \u201cSeems familiar? This had happened before?\u201dAfter Xueji expressed its misleading attitude, it fell silent.Chu Yin didn\u2019t bother to pay attention to it and slowly stepped forward. The bodyguard immediately stopped her.\u201cLittle sister, you can\u2019t go there.\u201dChu Yin pursed her lips: \u201cI\u2019m his\u2026 classmate.\u201d\u201cYou have no permission to visit Young Master.\u201dThe bodyguard next to her recognized her, \u201cYou\u2019re the one that day\u2026\u201dThe girl in front of them was the girl Young Master saved.Because he saved her, his spine got smashed by the falling ceiling and now he was lying on the hospital bed.The bodyguard looked at the girl in front of him.She was wearing a hospital gown and her clothes were loose. She had a fragile beauty. Both her face and skin were as delicate as porcelain. Her eyes were beautiful and pure. She had an indescribable beauty.He could understand why the young master would be like that.This kind of girl would make people go crazy.Although his young master was excellent and mature, most people thought of him as an emotionless machine. The Young Master rushed into the sea of flames to save his sweetheart\u2026this was truly admirable.The bodyguard sighed. \u201cLet me tell you something. The Young Master\u2019s condition is not very good. The medical experts have no positive diagnosis until now. So, little sister\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you want to wait, no one can blame you.\u201dHe overheard the conversation between the president of the hospital and the head nurse. If the young master\u2019s situation would be improved, it would be considered a medical miracle.Chu Yin paused for a few seconds, nodded, and thanked him. She turned around and left.No problem.Medical experts can\u2019t, but she can.Lu Zhen was seriously injured and fell into a vegetative state. He was almost at death\u2019s door at first.The bloody storm of the Lu family\u2019s fighting for power had just ended. Lu Linyuan was put to jail under the flashlight of the reporters, but the successor, Lu Zhen, had yet to show up.Reporters from the city scratched their hearts and squatted for several days, and finally got news from the nurse who leaked the news.Since the media reporters couldn\u2019t shut their mouths, the news of Lu Zhen\u2019s hospitalization spread like wildfire.Although they didn\u2019t know the specific situation, the injury must be so serious that he couldn\u2019t show up in public.Huiwen school soon learned the news.[ My brother Zhen! ][ Although I didn\u2019t vote for you this year, you\u2019re still my ex-husband ah!! ][ Brother Zhen, don\u2019t worry, wuwuwu ]The wealthy people knew more about it. The Liang family had plans to marry the Lu family, and they paid close attention to Lu Zhen.After several days of investigating, they finally discovered Lu Zhen\u2019s condition. They didn\u2019t expect it to be so serious.Liang Yueqi had complicated feelings.Although she couldn\u2019t get this person no matter how hard she tried, now that he fell into this despair, Liang Yueqi felt regretful.Fu Mingxuan, and other wealthy daughters who had the same ambitions for Lu Zhen, wanted to come and see him, but since it was a serious matter, they knew they couldn\u2019t.Song Zhaolin knew more about the details through his elder brother. He even knew\u2026 Chu Yin was there that night, and Lu Zhen\u2019s spine broke just to keep Chu Yin from being injured.When Chu Yin returned to school, her classmates thought that she was on vacation. She didn\u2019t explain too much. As she was sorting out her notes, she heard Song Zhaolin next to her burst into tears.Chu Yin looked over.Song Zhaolin cried: \u201cSister Yin, Brother Zhen\u2019s illness is serious.\u201dAlthough he knew he couldn\u2019t elaborate, he couldn\u2019t help but feel sad.Chu Yin sighed, didn\u2019t say anything, and just rolled out the papers and worked on the questions.There were still a few days left for the final exam, she must hurry up.\u2026to get the system\u2019s permission.Song Zhaolin looked at her in shock, Chu Yin didn\u2019t seem to be affected at all, even when this situation happened because Lu Zhen saved her\u2026He always knew that Chu Yin was a ruthless person, this kind of ruthlessness was indeed very handsome and cool, and he also knew that.But maybe, he was too sentimental, he was very sad whenever he thought of the once incomparably beautiful young man lying in bed with a tube full of pipes.Chu Yin stopped writing, sighed, and turned to look at Song Zhaolin, \u201cI\u2019m praying.\u201dSong Zhaolin sniffed his nose: \u201cHuh?\u201dChu Yin said, \u201cI asked around. The senior students who were about to take the college entrance examination pray very well.\u00a0 As long as they study hard, the Buddha will hear it.\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s eyes lit up: \u201cReally!!\u201d\u2014Fake.But he would believe it.Chu Yin touched her head: \u201cSo study.\u201dIn the next few days, Song Zhaolin started to study hard.The speed of Chu Yin answering questions was comparable to that of the devil.The final exam was over.It was time to return to school to get the results.During this time, Lu Zhen\u2019s actual situation was dug up bit by bit by the public, and it had caused a lot of noise.It was reported that the only heir of the Lu family had cancer and was receiving treatment recently.There was also gossip that the sole heir couldn\u2019t show up because of stress and mental problems.There were various kinds of rumors, each sounded terrible and tragic.When the results were announced, Chu Yin\u2019s grades on each subject were excellent. Although several events happened this semester, the good thing was that she has a good foundation and worked hard enough. She was still in the first place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You got perfect scores in essay!\u201dChu Yin raised her eyes, \u201cTotal score?\u201dJiang Yan: \u201c140! Too awesome!!!\u201dChu Yin sighed abruptly and then felt tired afterward.She knew that her Chinese language was weak.

It was a miracle.\u3011\u2018god\u2019 was so unreasonable.Because she had superpowers.\u2026Grandfather Lu lost a lot of his hair from worry.Everyone was watching the future of the Lu Household.If Lu Zhen falls, even if Grandfather Lu was in good health, there would be no successor in Lu\u2019s family, which would inevitably end in a dwindling day.All the wealthy families were watching silently, and the Song family was also one of them.Nothing else was special, but Song Yanchuan felt a little surprised seeing Song Zhaolin\u2019s unusually diligent learning state these days.However, after observing for a while, he found that after ten minutes of writing, Song Zhaolin would hold his pen to his chest, close his eyes, and recite words with a devout face.Song Yanchuan simply suspected that he had entered a cult.He went to listen to him secretly and heard his mutterings: \u201cGod, God, Buddha, bless Brother Zhen. Give him strength to get through the difficulties so he regains his consciousness. Amen, Hallelujah, Amitabha!\u201dSong Yanchuan: \u201c\u2026\u201dFirst of all, pray to have normal intelligence.Song Yanchuan went to the balcony and lit a cigarette.He didn\u2019t expect that the \u201cchosen son\u201d would end up like this.Because Song Yanchuan stood on Lu Zhen\u2019s side and made a thorough friendship with the Lu family, he knew more details. With the current level of medical treatment, Lu Zhen had no hope.Even if he would recover consciousness, he would have brain damage, which he had to carry for the rest of his life.Well, god knows\u2026Outside Lu Zhen\u2019s ward, the bodyguard rushed out excitedly: \u201cYoung Master is awake! Young Master is awake!!!\u201d\u2026Lu Zhen opened his eyes.All the muscles in his body were stiff, it should be because he laid down for too long.It took him a few seconds to sort out the situation and realized that this was a hospital ward.Before losing consciousness, the pain of being smashed by the ceiling disappeared.He felt it slowly and found that his whole body was normal. As if he had never died once.\u2026the boiling sea of fire, the girl in his arms, the cold kiss, the tearing pain, and the whistling sound in his mind.Lu Zhen was quiet for a moment.Then suddenly began to laugh.Uncontrollably laughing as his body quiver.It\u2019s Chu Yin.\u2026She didn\u2019t let him die.It was a miracle, coming by her own hands.\u2026The news of Lu Zhen\u2019s recovery was more tightly covered than the news of his serious injury and paralysis.After Grandfather Lu was overjoyed, Lu Zheni issued a severe seal order, and no one was allowed to expose Lu Zhen\u2019s situation. If people knew, he (LZ) would be dragged into the laboratory for anatomical observation.With such a serious injury and severely damaged nerves, he completely recovered with no side effects.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He knew Bodhisattva had blessed his grandson when he discovered he (LZ) was fully recovered.He had decided to set aside a large sum of money to invest in the construction of the temple in return for god\u2019s kindness to their Lu family.\u201cSince you\u2019re fine, don\u2019t stay in the hospital anymore. Grandfather has made arrangements for you to go home.\u201dLu Zhen smiled. \u201cNo hurry, just wait.\u201dHe still had important things to do.\u2026VIP ward late at night.The corridor was quiet and empty.Early in the morning, the door was quietly pushed open, and a slender figure wearing a large hood walked in.Lu Zhen sat leaning on the bed, with a book on his lap.His black hair was clean and soft, his cheeks were cold and white, and under his eye was the brown and read tear mole. He restrained himself coldly, like a quiet gentleman.Lu Zhen turned sideways slightly to watch her approaching figure and then threw the book aside.Chu Yin pulled a chair over, sat down, took off her hood, and looked at him with her arms folded.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes gently.The two people\u2019s eyes crossed, like a silent confrontation.After a lifetime of temptation and speculation, she finally understood\u2026they were the same.\u201cChu Yin.\u201d Lu Zhen softly called her.After being together in two lifetimes\u2026Chu Yin gently squeezed the corner of her clothes.\u201cFirst of all,\u201d she said, \u201cI saved you because we haven\u2019t settled anything yet. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201dLu Zhen didn\u2019t blink as his eyes fell on her face: \u201cWhich aspect?\u201dAfter a pause, he added, \u201cI think we have to settle a lot more than that.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026You are shameless.\u201dLu Zhen laughed: \u201cNo more.\u201dThe most important thing in this life was the person in front of him.Only you.Chu Yin turned her face aside.The ward was very quiet. Only the slight noise from the medical equipment could be heard.After a long time, Chu Yin turned back to look at him, suddenly feeling a little agitated.She endured it for too long.\u201cSo you kept me by your side because Lu Linyuan wanted to take me? But you didn\u2019t tell me? You\u2019re still getting worse and worse, like a psychopath. Doubting this, doubting that, I really want to kill you, Lu Zhen.\u201dLu Zhen was still smiling, but his eyes gradually became scarlet.The person he loves accused him of all his grievances in front of him, and these grievances were all caused by him.There was nothing more condemning than this.\u201cDo you know that you are really hateful? After so many things happened, do you consider yourself very strong? Or do you think I don\u2019t deserve to know? Just making me stay by your side? Lu Zhen, damn\u2026\u201dThere were no wounds in his body, but Lu Zhen felt the pain of being ripped apart.He wanted to say it, but he couldn\u2019t\u2026\u201cI can\u2019t say it.\u201d Lu Zhen was suddenly startled.As soon as his words fell, Chu Yin got angrier and suddenly stood up with trembling fingers.\u201cCan\u2019t say it? You find it difficult to speak? Are you dirtier than Lu Linyuan? Why don\u2019t you say it? Do you think it\u2019s an acceptable reason? Will I believe it after I\u2019ve been wronged for so long? Lu Zhen, are you kidding me? \u201cAt the end of her words, she started crying.She always cared.That night when she saw Lu Zhe, she was\u2026so happy. Even secretly regretting that they hadn\u2019t made up yet.During university days, Lu Zhen would always visit her before suddenly disappearing for a while.When he appeared that specific day, she wanted to scold him but instead invited him to eat shaved ice.If he died, who would pay her back for all the grievances she suffered?Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes were bloodshot red as he said with a hoarse voice, \u201cBecause the rules of the world\u2026 I can\u2019t explain.\u201dBut now, he could say it.Lu Zhen clearly realized something, and his hands that were clutching the quilt began to tremble.\u201cMy consciousness and my \u2018character design\u2019 keep on merging. When I can\u2019t control it, I will lose control. And I\u2026cannot explain, because this is the rule.\u201dThe world is a book, Lu Zhen\u2019s character design was\u2026 The paranoid male lead loves the white moonlight at first sight. When he blackened, he imprisoned this white moonlight.According to the plot, he and the white moonlight were doomed to have a tragic ending.But his self-consciousness awakened, and when he tried to resist the possessiveness, jealousy, and the desire to control, his character design exponentially increased.He couldn\u2019t suppress the despair in his body.Chu Yin rubbed her eyes, with a little nasal voice: \u201cThen why can you explain now?\u201d\u2026Yes, why?Lu Zhen suddenly laughed, his eyes slightly curved, a drop of tears gently slid down from the corner of his eye.Because the prohibition disappeared\u2026Lu Zhen understood the reason almost instantly. He smiled so much that he wanted to cry.He wanted to break away from the rules of the world by dying.But the \u201cgod\u201d who escaped from the rules personally wrote him a story and gave him a new life.\u2014So from then on, she became his rule.Chu Yin took him out from the circle.Lu Zhen suddenly took Chu Yin\u2019s hand and gently pulled it. She fell on him unexpectedly.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s hand trembled. Holding her small face, he gently and religiously kissed her on the forehead.The sufferings of his life were redeemed by her own hands.From now on, you are my world.\u201cI won\u2019t lose control anymore,\u201d Lu Zhen hugged the person in his arms and kissed her on the cheek lightly, \u201cI just like you so much that I\u2019m crazy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After this problem dispersed, a different kind of sadness overtook her heart.The world wouldn\u2019t compensate her for the tragedy she experienced.It also wouldn\u2019t compensate Lu Zhen for his sufferings.No one in this world knew what happened. After experiencing these events, she found that it was only the two of them who could understand each other.This terrible world.Lu Zhen squeezed her ears and softly touched her brown hair, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad.\u201dChu Yin raised her eyes. The redness in it hadn\u2019t faded yet. Her beautiful peach eyes were a little hazy.As Lu Zhen watched her, his heart started to feel hot. He wanted to kiss her eyes.Chu Yin shook her head and stepped back: \u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven you completely yet.\u201dShe felt that there were still many things to be clarified. Her mood had just calmed down and her brain was still in a mess.Lu Zhen quietly pulled her in his arms and explained in a low voice, \u201cI suddenly disappeared that year because my uncle started to act.\u201dChu Yin was stupefied, forgetting to break free from him.This was something she thought about for a long time.\u201cI was\u2026unprepared. I had to imrpove myself plus my acting was too bad.\u201d Lu Zhen laughed at himself.He needed to have better acting. Lu Linyuan wasn\u2019t someone that could easily be fooled.\u201cWhen I took you to see my mother, I was hoping that you could get some information from her.\u201dChu Yin blinked. Other than talking about the weather, she also felt that Su Yumin was quiet and melancholy at the time.To remember everything in this life, Lu Zhen went to the nursing home to find the last key.At that time, he stood by Su Yumin\u2019s bed and waited patiently for a long, long time before he heard his mother\u2019s frightened voice.What she said was:\u201cI\u2019m dirty.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t come near me.\u201d\u201cI shouldn\u2019t be alive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a sinner\u2026\u201dThe 17-year-old Lu Zhen stood unmovingly.Then, in the midst of all these, he realized that his mother\u2019s rejection and resistance for so many years was not against him.But of disgust to herself.Lu Linyuan stretched out his hand and gave her the most tender and intimate hug. Seeing her like this, he suppressed his negative emotions.Su Yumin was completely brainwashed. Killing her husband became her crime.She couldn\u2019t face her son nor could she face herself. She could only be at his mercy.Chu Yin was startled.So the words she heard from Lu Linyuan to Su Yumin that day had started even long before. Lu Linyuan, a dog man, was simply someone who wasn\u2019t worthy of living.Plus, he also tried to turn Chu Yin into a second Su Yumin.Lu Zhen subconsciously tightened his hands and hugged the person in his arms.It took Chu Yin a long time to come back to her senses. The root cause of all these tragedies was Lu Linyuan \u2013 the evil driving force derived from the plot.Fortunately, the problem had been solved in this life. The dog man was imprisoned. She vowed to make his life worse for the rest of his life.Lu Zhen touched the top of her hair and waited until she digested all the information before continuing.\u201cMy mother\u2026 is not from a famous family. After being married with my father, she was at a disadvantage in her mentality. I found out too late that because of that, she wasn\u2019t confident. So\u2026\u201d Lu Zhen suddenly smiled faintly, \u201cI forced you to study hard.\u201dChu Yin was stunned.She understood what he meant even when he hadn\u2019t finished speaking yet.The 17-year-old Chu Yin was beautiful, but also stubborn and inferior.He forced her to learn piano and self-defense. He hoped she would have confidence and not be suppressed by anyone. He didn\u2019t want her to become like Su Yumin.\u201cYou\u2019re fine.\u201d Lu Zhen curled his lips.Chu Yin\u2019s eyes blinked a few times. After a long time, her cheeks bulged, and awkwardly said, \u201cI worked very hard in my life. I achieved my grades by my own effort.\u201d\u201cI know,\u201d Lu Zhen smiled as he squeezed her cheek, \u201cSo\u2026 very dazzling.\u201dThe ward was quiet. No one was passing by the corridor.A long time later, Chu Yin\u2019s voice sounded in the ward. \u201cLu Zhen, you\u2019re hugging me too tightly.\u201dIt took a while for her to digest the information. Only after she sorted it out did she realized that Lu Zhen\u2019s posture was wrong.His head was buried in her neck. As his black hair was rubbing the skin, it slightly itched.Chu Yin hurriedly pushed his head: \u201cGet up.\u201d\u201cJust a hug.\u201dChu Yin put his hand on his chest and began to struggle.She felt that she had forgotten something important, but she couldn\u2019t remember it for a while.The most important thing right now was to keep away from Lu Zhen.Chu Yin struggled a few times, but he didn\u2019t break away.She glared, \u201cI\u2019m really going to hit you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t move.\u201d Lu Zhen opened his mouth. His voice was a little dumb.Chu Yin: \u201cWhy? I won\u2019t obey you.\u201dLu Zhen pressed her close and whispered a few words to her ears.Chu Yin\u2019s face suddenly turned red.A few seconds later, there was a scream in the ward. \u201cLu Zhen! You shameless!!!\u201dChu Yin quickly jumped out, picked up a pillow, and hit Lu Zhen\u2019s face.Lu Zhen calmly took down the pillow and hugged it. His eyes were dark and innocent.The person he likes was in his arms, touching her. Lu Zhen\u2019s desire for her was growing strong.Chu Yin\u2019s cheeks were hot. Since she had been away from the adult world for too long, she couldn\u2019t bear it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She pointed at the person on the bed. \u201cI have to study now. No one could hinder me from studying.\u201dThere was still a semester to go before the college entrance examination. Although something big happened, Chu Yin\u2019s priority was still the college entrance exam.Lu Zhen nodded and smiled. \u201cGood.\u201dChu Yin fiercely warned him. \u201cBe careful. If you do that again, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201dLu Zhen raised his hand, blocking the smile on his lips: \u201cI understand.\u201dAfter that, Chu Yin put on her hood again, glared at him one last time, turned, and walked towards the door.\u201cGo and study hard. I will always be looking at you from behind.\u201dLu Zhen looked at her back, his voice very soft, but firm. \u201cThe most important thing in my life is you.\u201dLu Zhen, the successor of the Lu family, reappeared in the public eye, looking healthy and calm, breaking all kinds of weird rumors.Not long later, a board meeting hosted by Grandfather Lu was convened which was unanimously approved, making Lu Zhen the new director and marking Lu Zhen\u2019s official beginning of taking over the affairs of the Lu Group.From then on, he changed from the young master to the CEO of the Lu.Lu Linyuan\u2019s case would take time to solve. Grandfather Lu took a great deal to solve this matter carefully. Those who tried to threaten the Lu Family would have to be gouged out.On a rainy day, Lu Zhen went to the place where Lu Linyuan was detained.The car stopped outside the prison. Lu Zhen was wearing a black coat.He walked into the interview room, sat down on the glass side, and waited quietly.Not long after, the door opposite to the room opened, Lu Linyuan, who was wearing a prison uniform, walked out slowly. His handsome face, which was properly maintained, had grown old in just a few days.As soon as he saw Lu Zhen, he started to laugh.\u201cOh, Azhen~ No, I should call you Master Lu now, right?\u201dLu Zhen looked at him silently.In his previous life, he also sent Lu Linyuan to prison, but it was many years later than now. The process was much harder.Seeing Lu Linyuan wearing a prison uniform earlier in this life, Lu Zhen felt very calm.The most important thing had been solved by him. Looking at Lu Linyuan now, he was nothing more than a character controlled by the plot.\u201cAre you getting used to it?\u201d Lu Zhen asked blankly.Lu Linyuan\u2019s expression was stiff. The person opposite to him was delicate and calm, contrary to him who was separated by the glass. The stark difference made him feel resentful. His eyes became gloomy.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Of course I like the place my nephew personally sent me.\u201d Lu Linyuan said weirdly.Lu Zhen was not surprised: \u201cThat\u2019s good that you like it. After all, you have to stay there for a long time.\u201dLu Linyuan\u2019s face was distorted for a moment, and he suddenly smiled: \u201cBy the way, is that little girl Chu Yin okay?\u201dHe suddenly approached the glass, stared at Lu Zhen as he whispered. \u201cTo be honest, she\u2019s so beautiful. I feel distressed when I decided to burn her. Azhen, you forced me to do this. Do you know you killed her?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s black eyes looked at him unblinkingly, and then the corners of his lips slightly curled up. \u201cShe\u2019s fine. No parts of her body has been hurt.\u201dLu Linyuan had no access to the news in prison. Hearing Lu Zhen\u2019s words, his eyebrows nervously moved.\u201cBut you provoke someone you shouldn\u2019t provoke.\u201d Lu Zhen said.Lu Linyuan laughed as if he heard some joke, \u201cSomeone I can\u2019t mess with? Who? You? My dear Azhen, don\u2019t think highly of yourself\u201dLu Zhen smiled and shook his head: \u201cShe.\u201dLu Linyuan was taken aback.She? What she?Was there someone backing up Lu Zhen? Who was it?When the visiting time was up, the alarm bell rang.Lu Linyuan looked at him abruptly: \u201cWho is helping you?!\u201dSong Yanchuan didn\u2019t have the ability to turn against the water. Could it be that an aristocratic family was secretly supporting Lu Zhen? Lu Linyuan thought gloomily.Many kinds of conspiracies flashed through his mind.Lu Zhen stood up, looking at him with a condescending smile. He had been his enemy for two lifetimes.He once thought that since Lu Linyuan ruined their lives, as revenge, he would make him pay twice the agony they had received.But now he felt it was unnecessary.She should make the ending for you.\u201cAccept your fate, uncle.\u201d After that, Lu Zhen turned and left.This time.The gods protected me.And they chose to judge you.\u2026It took Chu Yin a long time to see Lu Linyuan\u2019s part in the script.The trial process was long. The Lu family sincerely cooperated with the police.When the results of Lu Linyuan\u2019s trial came out, the short winter vacation was over.Lu Linyuan was sentenced to life imprisonment. But Chu Yin felt that a person like him wouldn\u2019t repent even if he was sent to prison.He never repented for all the tortures he caused to others. Lu Linyuan just felt he lost to Lu Zhen. He didn\u2019t think any of his deeds were wrong.Chu Yin laughed at the script twice.At the thought of what Lu Linyuan had done to Lu Zhen\u2019s mother and what he had tried to do to her, Chu Yin was very angry.Don\u2019t want to repent? It doesn\u2019t matter, I\u2019ll help you repent.She would let the old pervert taste the feeling of being tortured so that he would learn to repent!Amen! Chu Yin\u2019s trial is coming!\u2014\u2026As a former celebrity, Lu Linyuan certainly had superiority compared with these prisoners.Although he was sentenced to life imprisonment, as long as the means were in place, it was not impossible to turn his cell into a hotel.But the conditions here are a bit too bad. The cafeteria and bathhouses are all public, and they are all basic living needs. Under the operation of Lu Linyuan, he asked the prison guards to use the toilet in the public bathhouse alone.But the conditions here were too bad. The cafeteria and bathrooms were all shared. Lu Linyuan asked the prison guards to give him the toilet for his exclusive use.\u201cOh, isn\u2019t this the big boss?\u201dThe prisoner who watched Lu Linyuan enter the dressing room whistled.Lu Linyuan\u2019s face was gloomy. He gave him a disdained look.\u201cOh, the big boss wants to ignore us\u2013\u201cSeveral shirtless men gathered around and began to push him.\u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201d\u201cBig boss, these little ones want to serve you!\u201d\u201cGet out!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? I told you to get out!\u201dSeveral people, regardless of Lu Linyuan\u2019s scolding and resistance, \u201cserve\u201d him by taking off his clothes. They were surprised at what they saw.\u201cMy\u2013\u201c\u201cHe turned out to be a eunuch?\u201d\u201c!!!\u201dFuck! This disrespectful behavior.Lu Linyuan had never suffered such humiliation in his entire life. His face was pale.Because of his social status before, he should have a comfortable life here. No one would dare to trouble him.Why did the situation suddenly change?!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Come and have a look!\u201dPeople began to toss him amidst the laughter.And in the crevice of the crowd, a person looked at him with a strange smile on their face.Lu Linyuan\u2019s prison life had just begun.The new semester had begun.This was the last semester before the college entrance examination start. It would be in a few months.Chu Yin was busily preparing for the exam.And Huiwen was very lively today, because\u2026Lu Zhen was back.The young man in black clothes and trousers stood at the entrance of the corridor, his lips hooked as he watched Chu Yin walking in with her bag.She had been busy studying hard these days. He sent her messages every day and she would occasionally reply to them.The Huiwen students were very excited when they saw Lu Zhen.After all, they thought Brother Zhen was going to die, but now he was standing here, still as handsome as before. How could they not be excited!The whole corridor was secretly watching him.Lu Zhen leaned against the wall, and when Chu Yin walked over, he smiled and stopped in front of her.Chu Yin raised her eyes, glanced at all directions, and pursed her lips. \u201cWhy?\u201dLu Zhen raised his hand and straightened her collar. When he lowered his head, he whispered, \u201cI miss you.\u201dHis low voice made her feel itchy in the ears.Chu Yin was instantly alerted.Fortunately, no one was standing close, otherwise, she couldn\u2019t imagine how big the uproar among the students would be.However, all the people in the corridor were already shocked.\u2014No! What happened?\u2014The former School\u2019s Apollo was fixing the present School\u2019s Apollo, bah \u2013 School\u2019s Flower! Her collar?\u2014Something\u2019s wrong! Something\u2019s wrong!Chu Yin stepped on Lu Zhen\u2019s foot expressionlessly and said in a low voice, \u201cYou. Don\u2019t. Disturb. Me.\u201dLu Zhen snorted and then looked down. Seeing her white and small ears becoming red, Lu Zhen laughed: \u201cI understand.\u201dChu Yin was about to walk into the classroom when suddenly, a voice full of emotion, roared.\u201cBrother~~~\u201dSong Zhaolin threw himself in front of Lu Zhen: \u201cI miss you so much!!!\u201dAlthough he knew the news of Lu Zhen\u2019s recovery in advance, Song Zhaolin hadn\u2019t seen him at all.When looking at Lu Zhen this time, he couldn\u2019t help but burst into tears!Lu Zhen smiles: \u201cI know.\u201dSong Zhaolin saw Chu Yin next to him, and hurriedly rushed over: \u201cSister Yin! I miss you too!\u201dBut before he took a step, he was directly tossed by Lu Zhen. Pulling back his collar, Lu Zhen warned. \u201cKeep your distance.\u201dSong Zhaolin blinked his eyes: \u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhen: \u201cDon\u2019t get close to her in class.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201cHuh?\u201dLu Zhen patted him on the shoulder: \u201cOr I\u2019ll beat you.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026Oh.\u201dAfter a second, he suddenly felt that something was wrong \u2013\u00a0CEO Lu, how can you act like this to your savior?!\u201cBrother Zhen, don\u2019t you know! I prayed day and night for your health recovery!\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c?\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dShe forgot that she fooled him.Song Zhaolin triumphantly said. \u201cFor you, i studied hard for a few days, begging all the gods in the east and the west. Hey, sure enough! They answered my prayers and healed you.\u201dChu Yin covered her face, pretending not to see him.\u201cOh?\u201d Lu Zhen chuckled and glanced across Chu Yin, \u201cSo it\u2019s thanks to you?\u201dChu Yin put down her hand, her little face was tensed. She turned and entered the classroom.But before she stepped into the classroom door, she was held back.Lu Zhen smiled. He placed sweet milk in her palm.The milk was still hot.Lu Zhen carefully closed her fingers and poked her cheeks. His eyebrows softened as he said: \u201cI know it\u2019s you. Go study.\u201dChu Yin lowered her eyes. She snorted before taking the milk from him.Song Zhaolin looked left and right. He realized something was wrong.It was obviously the three of them. Why couldn\u2019t he join the conversation?\u2026The whole grade found out.Lu Zhen rarely appeared in school, but there was one thing in common where he would only appear.Chu Yin was there.Lu Zhen did not interrupt her study but went to her during the break or occasional physical education class.Lu Zhen didn\u2019t disturb her study. He would sometimes visit her during breaks or when it was time for a physical education class.But wise people noticed that the wind had changed.Lu Zhen would appear in the cafeteria and put a cup of hot milk tea on Chu Yin\u2019s table. He would appear during the physical education class and accompany her to run.Various posts were floating in the forum\u2014 [ My ship is finally sailing! ][ Is my CP truly dating! I\u2019ll start my investigation now! Tune in for more melon-seeds news! ]While Chu Yin was studying, she periodically heard these rumors.Song Zhaolin couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cReally? Really? No, no, no, no?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cBe quiet!\u201dNext time Lu Zhen comes back, she must educate him!The weather was getting warmer, so you don\u2019t need to wear a jacket for gym class. High school seniors have very few physical education classes. This semester is only one week a week. After class, all the students ran out excitedly.The weather was getting warmer. It was no longer necessary to wear a jacket in gym class. Senior students had few gym classes. This semester only had one class a week.Chu Yin sat in an empty classroom to study. Not long after, a figure swayed in.He placed a cup of milk tea on the table. And added her favorite taro balls.As soon as she raised her head, Lu Zhen had already sat on the chair. He leaned against his temple with one hand, tilted his head, and smiled at her.The sun was warm. The blue sky and white clouds were beautiful. The young man slightly smiled. She was the only one reflected in his dark eyes.Chu Yin was stunned for a second and was dazzled by him. Her eyelashes fluttered a few times before remembering an unfinished business.\u201cCome here.\u201d She hooked her finger, and then led the person to the corner of the corridor.At this moment, a random student happened to pass by. When she saw these two figures, she immediately raised her vigilance.The student held her breath, quietly stood by the wall, and peeked out her head.The legendary elder sister (CY) leaned her back against the wall, with one hand on her hips, saying something.The legendary senior (LZ) stood in front of her, with his head slightly lowered, showing a well-behaved and obedient attitude.This situation looked like a teacher educating a student??\u00a0 It\u2019s just that their posture was a bit wrong.The student didn\u2019t understand what was going on. She temporarily put her head back, took a breath, and then stretched her head out again. To eat melon-seeds, she didn\u2019t mind acting indecently anymore!But as she poked her head out, she was suddenly stupefied.They\u2019re fighting??What the fuck?Her heart was beating, but when she took a closer look, she misunderstood.The legendary senior was beaten unilaterally!Chu Yin wrapped him by the arms, kicked him with her foot, and then beat him several times with her fist.She could faintly hear her low and fierce voice: \u201cDon\u2019t laugh!\u201dShe retracted her head in shock.Was the CP fake? Were these two fine on the surface but not on the inside?Oh my! This was amazing!She took a breath again and then secretly poked her head out one last time.This time, the elder sister (CY) had stopped beating the senior (LZ).But she was stupefied again.Because she saw the legendary senior carefully hugging the legendary elder sister. The senior then lowered his head\u2026And lightly kissed the elder sister\u2019s ear.\u2014The student ran away.Her face was red. Her heart jumped 180 degrees.She was not worthy to witness such a bright and special occasion. She was not worthy!!!\u2026Lu Zhen carefully hugged Chu Yin. He asked with a low smile: \u201cStill fighting me?\u201dShe breathed. There was a sense of joy overcoming her heart.Chu Yin didn\u2019t know if it was because of the exercise she had, but her porcelain face was slightly red.She whispered. \u201cRestrain yourself. If you can\u2019t, don\u2019t come to school! Or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Lu Zhen responded obediently, and then carefully held her hands.Chu Yin was distracted by him so she subconsciously looked up, \u201cHey\u2013\u201dLu Zhen smiled, lowered his head, and kissed her small ears.\u201cAh, it\u2019s hot.\u201d He chuckled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I declare! Student Chu is late for gym class! Do you understand what this means!Anonymous 66: Damn! Someone saw Student Lu coming into the school!!Anonymous 67: Ahhh!!Anonymous 70: This is it!!Chu Yin walked out from a corner with a red face.\u201cGo! Don\u2019t accompany me to gym class.\u201dWhen Lu Zhen came, the students in the gym were looking at them, which was too flashy.\u201cOkay,\u201d Lu Zhen smiled. He followed behind her calmly and asked in a low voice, \u201cWill you send me off?\u201dChu Yin: \u201cNo! I\u2019m going to class.\u201dLu Zhen said, \u201cSend me to the gate of the school. I won\u2019t bother you for a week.\u201dHe was going on a business trip soon and only came to see her before leaving.Even if Chu Yin didn\u2019t send him off, Lu Zhen wouldn\u2019t be able to visit her for a week.But Chu Yin did not know this.She stopped, looking back: \u201cReally?\u201dLu Zhen laughed. \u201cReally.\u201dChu Yin raised her chin. \u201cAll right.\u201dThere was no one on campus except for the teachers who wouldn\u2019t care about them cutting classes during this time.\u2014One student was the teachers\u2019 favorite, and the other student was a wealthy young master. The people walked together. The girl looked severe as she led the way while the boy lazily followed her behind.The teacher thought with satisfaction that she was indeed a Huiwen child, excellent and beautiful!Chu Yin defiantly walked, leading Lu Zhen to the gate of the school. When they arrived, she raised her chin arrogantly, \u201cGo.\u201dLu Zhen nodded, \u201cDrink the milk while it\u2019s hot.\u201dChu Yin \u201cOh.\u201dLu Zhen raised his head and touched her. He couldn\u2019t help asking: \u201cDo you still hate me?\u201dChu Yin raised her eyes before lowering them after. She kicked the small stone as she said, \u201cNot that much.\u201dLu Zhen smiled and touched her hair.\u201cThen I\u2019m leaving,\u201d Chu Yin said.After she turned around, Lu Zhen suddenly said behind her: \u201cChu Yin, I have also read that book.\u201dChu Yin paused.The boy\u2019s voice was clear: \u201cYou like me back then. I will try to win you over again.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyelashes trembled slightly.Then she turned her head, scolded him in her mind.But Lu Zhen behind her added: \u201c\u2026In a way, it won\u2019t affect your study.\u201dChu Yin suddenly smiled.\u201cOh, then you work hard.\u201d Chu Yin said.Then she curled her lips, raised her chin again, and walked away.\u2026\u201cSo, Lu Zhen has also read it?\u201d Chu Yin poked the system.Xueji: \u201cIt looks like he did.\u201dChu Yin stroked her chin, guessing that he might have read this in their previous life.However, after the male protagonist\u2019s \u201cself\u201d awakened, he would know that this world was unusual. Chu Yin understood it.Since Lu Zhen had broken free from the shackles of the \u2018male lead,\u2019 correspondingly, her \u2018bai Yue Guang status had disappeared.Chu Yin walked to the classroom while thinking about things. She returned to her seat, saw the milk on the corner of the table, and suddenly remembered something.She got the golden finger since she knew that the world was a book. She had been busy with the dog man that she never thought deeply about the Bai Yueguang character in the novel. If she was destined to \u2018deadly die early,\u2019 who was the female lead?She frowned. Somehow, the first words she heard when she woke up suddenly came to her mind. Xueji narrated a paragraph in her mind \u2013 the core content of the whole book.She remembered that there was a word \u201cstand-in\u201d in that paragraph. Was this the female lead?Chu Yin\u2019s fingers suddenly squeezed. She asked coldly, \u201cWho\u2019s the substitute?\u201dXueji: \u201cThe system can\u2019t tell.\u201dThe warmth that had just emerged in Chu Yin\u2019s heart was wiped clean. She felt cold.If Xueji didn\u2019t want to say it, she could get the answers herself. It should look like her at least. She pondered for two seconds and snorted in her heart \u2013 Could it be Chu Qiuqiu??It\u2019s probably only her fake sister in the world who looks like her, right?Chu Yin banged on the system, gnashing her teeth: \u201cIs what I thought correct?\u201dAfter a few seconds, Xue Ji said leisurely: \u201cNo, host. You guessed it wrong.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c?\u201dXueji: \u201cThe \u2018substitute\u2019 doesn\u2019t look like you at all.\u201dChu Yin was stupefied.\u2026Not?Doesn\u2019t look like her?What kind of body did you replace?Chu Yin hadn\u2019t figured it out yet. She sometimes thought about this issue while she was busy with her studies.\u2014Every time she thought about it, she would drag Lu Zhen\u2019s in her mind and whip it.The dog man did not come to bother her recently. Chu Yin secretly decided that the next time she saw him, she had to ask him. If his explanation was not clear, she should just cremate him.Destroy it!With over two months left before the college entrance examination, Chu Yin\u2019s mock test results were excellent, ranking first in the city.Now the atmosphere within the students was getting tough day by day. Jiang Yan and the others had been working hard with Chu Yin as their goal. Han Chuying wholeheartedly wanted to follow Chu Yin.Even Song Zhaolin increased his study time from one hour a day to three hours a day. Under Song Yanchuan\u2019s violent suppression, he earnestly studied. The game consoles were confiscated, and he was not allowed to go out to play on weekends.\u201cI can finally breathe soon!\u201d Song Zhaolin roared during the break, \u201cI will be able to watch movies next week hahahaha\u2014\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d Chu Yin was silent for a moment, \u201cLinlin, what\u2019s the name of the movie?\u201dSong Zhaolin said that the \u201cmovie\u201d was a documentary on Ideal Education organized by the Municipal Education Commission. This was a required movie for liberal arts students.After watching the movie, they would have to write a reflection with political analysis.Chu Yin ultimately regarded this as the content of her study.Song Zhaolin: \u201cI don\u2019t care! As long as it\u2019s in the cinema, it\u2019s the same as watching a movie!\u201dWith his current pain and boredom, he would enjoy himself with this documentary.\u201cAfter watching the movie, there will be a coming-of-age party soon!\u201d Song Zhaolin snored. \u201cI will rely on these two activities to continue my life!\u201dAt the coming-of-age ceremony, Huiwen permitted senior high school students to wear dresses and suits! This year, everyone would be fighting for the best look. Song Zhaolin liked this kind of scene the most!Chu Yin remained unmoved, glanced at the paper in his hand, and sighed at the bright red 60 points.\u201cI think it will be difficult to continue to living your life.\u201dAlthough she didn\u2019t understand Song Yanchuan, she knew that he was the last to join Lu Zhen\u2019s side. She didn\u2019t know whether Song Zhaolin was a factor for him changing sides. Humans were indeed cold-blooded animals whose interests were paramount.\u201cI hope you won\u2019t be beaten to death by your brother after you get your score, Lin Lin.\u201d Chu Yin said regretfully.Song Zhaolin shivered, honestly picked up the book, and started to study it.On the day of \u2018watching the movie,\u2019 the students of Huiwen went to the cinema designated by the Municipal Education Commission under the guidance of the teachers.The senior high school students in the neighboring school happened to be there. The two groups of students met each other on a narrow road outside the cinema.Han Chuying appeared beside Chu Yin, patted her on the shoulder, and pointed in a direction with her chin: \u201cLook, \u2018Great God Chang\u2019 is acting arrogant again.\u201dChang Jinggeng stood in the crowd, hatefully looking at the group of students opposite to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Being signed in by a university meant he wouldn\u2019t have to experience the pressure of college entrance examinations. He had a sense of superiority written on his face \u2013 especially when he saw Chu Yin.Since he spent too much time looking for a university to sign him, placing second in the mock test wasn\u2019t surprising. When he inquired, he learned that Chu Yin hadn\u2019t signed in with any other school.Cleaning the school gate of Huiwen for a month was a dark history of his life. Chang Jinggeng had finally moved on and was a step ahead of all of his peers. He felt he had won against Chu Yin.\u201cOh, classmate Chu, long time no see? How are you preparing for the exam?\u201d Chang Jinggeng stopped Chu Yin as she passed by.As soon as he said this, all the Huiwen students outside the cinema looked over.\u201cWhy is he talking to Chu Yin?\u201d\u201cTo show off. Didn\u2019t he sign a contract with Q University?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m speechless.\u201dA black Maybach stopped slowly on the far side of the road, and a tall figure came out of the car.Chu Yin faced Chang Jinggeng with a very light expression: \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dChang Jinggeng put his hands on his back and showed a concerned smile: \u201cit should be hard, right?\u201dChu Yin raised her eyes and looked at him: \u201cOh, it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not as hard as cleaning the school gate.\u201d\u201cPuff\u2014\u201d\u201cHahahahahahahahahahaha!!\u201d\u201cElder Sister Chu Yin so cool! Hahahaha I am laughing!\u201dThe students of Huiwen and even students in Chang Jinggeng\u2019s school couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Chang Jinggeng was angry. Chu Yin made fun of the darkest period of his life!He snorted. \u201cIf you want to be admitted to Province B, you need to work harder. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m attacking you. Famous universities in Province B accept few people. Good luck.\u201dChu Yin laughed. Up. Huiwen, a private nobleman, was incomparable in signing the college entrance examination with a veteran such as No. 1 Middle School. The projects that she could get were not the schools and majors that Chu Yin liked, so she did not participate in any projects during the winter vacation.Chu Yin laughed. The projects she could get were not the majors that Chu Yin likes, so she didn\u2019t take part in any projects during the winter vacation.What\u2019s more, she planned to take the college entrance examination seriously, and Chang Jinggeng\u2019s mockery of her was simply meaningless.Chu Yin smiled, stretched out her hand, and patted Chang Jinggeng on the shoulder.Because she used too much strength, Chang Jinggeng almost fell. Chu Yin caught him as he was about to fall, then patted him twice. The threat was unmistakable.\u201cIt\u2019s my business whether I take or not. Do you want me to mind your business too?\u201d She smiled.Chang Jinggeng remembered at this time that Chu Yin had knocked down three gangsters. \u201cNo,Chu Yin gave him one last pat before wandering off to the cinema.It wasn\u2019t until she left that Chang Jinggeng shouted unwillingly: \u201cWelcome to Q University!\u201dThe person who came out from the Maybach happened to pass by. Hearing this, he glanced at Chang Jinggeng expressionlessly.Chang Jinggeng shivered as he was glanced at by Lu Zhen.Jiang Yan, who was beside Chu Yin, asked in a low voice, \u201cYin Yin, do you plan to go to Q University?\u201dShe remembered that Wei Heming, the senior of the neighboring middle school, had also told Chu Yin that he would be there. He would be waiting for her at Q University.Chu Yin shook her head: \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201dIt was better to study business in B or R Universities. Her college entrance examination goal was these two.\u201cHmm!\u201d Jiang Yan nodded.Because they were delayed, the seats in the front row were total.Song Zhaolin stretched out his arms and greeted them: \u201cHere, here!\u201dHe was at the far end of the second-to-last row, near the back door, so he could sneak out to buy popcorn at any time.Jiang Yan wanted to sit beside Chu Yin, but there was only one seat beside Song Zhaolin, so she was in the back of Song Zhaolin.The whole screening hall was buzzing with excitement, even if the show they watched was boring.It didn\u2019t take long for the documentary to officially begin, the music promoting the main melody sounded, and the theater finally quieted down.Song Zhaolin was sleepy, but Chu Yin next to him was very energetic.He turned his head and found that everyone was watching it seriously. Just when he wanted to sneak out to buy popcorn, a white and slender hand touched his shoulder.Song Zhaolin was taken aback and abruptly turned. Lu Zhen was looking at him condescendingly.Song Zhaolin showed a surprised expression: \u201c!\u201dLu Zhen curled his lips and smiled lightly.Song Zhaolin blinked his eyes: \u201c?\u201dLu Zhen still smiled.Song Zhaolin suddenly understood. He stood up silently and gave his mother\u00a01\u00a0a seat.This was the story of three people.Chu Yin didn\u2019t care when Song Zhaolin got up, but she turned her head suddenly when a familiar smell came from her side.Lu Zhen smiled and leaned on the back of his chair. The light of the big screen gradually fell on his face, which was indeed a flawless face.Chu Yin glanced at him and sullenly turned back.The act of whipping the corpse was not done yet.Lu Zhen had just come back from Province B when he heard that Huiwen\u2019s students would be in today\u2019s cinema.It wasn\u2019t a movie. And Chu Yin didn\u2019t seem to be in a good mood.Lu Zhen came in through the back door, plus they sat too far back, so no one noticed his existence for a moment.They sat side by side for a while. Chu Yin stared at the big screen and ignored him. After a while, she suddenly felt cool on her wrist.As soon as she lowered her head, she saw him tying something on her wrist.Chu Yin lowered her voice and said, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201dAfter Lu Zhen tied it up, he raised his finger to poke her cheek: \u201cMosquito-proof.\u201dChu Yin turned back with a cold face.Lu Zhen gently rubbed her wrist, then moved a little closer, and asked, \u201cAre you going to take the exam at Q University?\u201dHis breath swept over gently, with the sweetness of mint.It seemed that Lu Zhen heard Chang Jinggeng\u2019s words. Chu Yin suddenly understood why he asked. She deliberately replied: \u201cIt\u2019s possible. Q University is outstanding.\u201dThe fingers on her wrist suddenly tightened slightly.Then he relaxed. His voice was low as he whispered: \u201cI thought you would choose universities like B and R.\u201dChu Yin hummed coldly from the bottom of her heart. He got it right.Lu Zhen knew that she had a mission to watch this movie, so he didn\u2019t bother her.It was not until the documentary was over and the lights in the projection hall turned on again that Lu Zhen turned his head and asked in a low voice, \u201cUnhappy?\u201dChu Yin had no expression: \u201cWatching this documentary seriously.\u201dShe planned to wait so there would be fewer people in the cinema before asking Lu Zhen the question about her \u2018stand-in.\u2019But when the light turned on, people immediately saw Lu Zhen. Then they saw Lu Zhen and Chu Yin sitting together.They covered their mouths in excitement and looked back as they walked.After the students left the scene, only the cleaning aunt with a broom walked in. When she saw them both, she suddenly smiled with a very understanding face.\u201cOh, these teenagers look like dolls!\u201d\u201cSuch a good match! They look like people from the magazines!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips hooked. When Chu Yin caught a glimpse of him, she was even more unhappy. She squeezed his sleeves. : \u201cCome with me.\u201dLu Zhen obediently followed her.Chu Yin turned around and walked to the bathroom on the second floor of the theater. There was no one bathroom.Lu Zhen patiently stood in front of her and smiled. \u201cSay it.\u201dHe even felt joy in his heart. It seemed that Chu Yin had a lot to say to him.Chu Yin was about to open her mouth but found it challenging to speak again.How to say it? It seemed that she cared.In fact, what happened after her death had nothing to do with her.But she was inexplicably uncomfortable.Facing Lu Zhen\u2019s smiling face, she paused for a few seconds and simply asked: \u201cWho was my stand-in?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyebrows were slightly raised.Chu Yin coldly looked at him. \u201cIt said in the book that you looked for a stand-in.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s eyelashes flicked as he suddenly smiled.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember?\u201d he asked.Chu Yin: \u201cHuh?\u201dShe thought of all the possible answers, but she hadn\u2019t expected that Lu Zhen would throw this question back to her.Lu Zhen carefully looked at the blankness in her eyes, then lowered his eyes and took a step closer.Chu Yin stepped back subconsciously. Her waist was pressed on the sink.\u00a0 \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLu Zhen touched her cheeks.He whispered. \u201cYou don\u2019t remember. You came back.\u201dChu Yin blinked. She was at a loss for a moment. From her perspective, after losing consciousness in her previous life, she had a long dream before waking up and realizing she turned back to the time she was 17.Lu Zhen suddenly understood a lot of things.\u201c\u2026Chu Yin.\u201d his fingertips touched her warm skin, and he whispered. \u201cWho can replace you?Chu Yin\u2019s back shuddered slightly inexplicably: \u201cThat\u2019s\u2026what\u2019s going on?\u201dIsn\u2019t the \u2018stand-in\u2019 the female lead of this book?Lu Zhen leaned close to her ear and told her a short story.After she passed away, it was confirmed that he thought of her day and night, and it was confirmed that he met another \u201cshe\u201d one day.Different looks and different bodies. Everything was different.But Lu Zhen knew that it was her.Suddenly a little light appeared in his devastating life.\u201cBut you returned to kill me.\u201d Lu Zhen\u2019s voice was smiling.Chu Yin\u2019s brain became a little chaotic. Some scattered fragments began to reappear. What happened in the middle of that long dream?\u201cYou entered my company and went to my side,\u201d Lu Zhen chuckled, \u201cYou planned to poison my cup, but you poured it out. You planned to kill me in my sleep, but you gave up. I\u2019ve given you many chances to kill me, but your heart softened numerous times.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s eyelashes trembled. This was absurd.But subconsciously, her memory was showing up bit by bit.\u201cYou didn\u2019t kill me.\u201d Lu Zhen looked at her very closely, his pupils clear and deep, \u201cIn the end, you left..\u201dChu Yin\u2019s fingers tightened. She heard a distant collapse in his voice.Lu Zhen looked at her intensely.This strange world made the 27-year-old Lu Zhen meet Chu Yin again.She wanted to kill him. He was willing.But she gave up and left again.Lu Zhen\u2019s world collapsed completely.Then he killed himself in his bed.He didn\u2019t eat nor drink. He was like the living dead.He made himself sleep all the time. To sleep so he could dream.To sleep and dream of that year.Warn the 17-year-old Lu Zhen that if he wanted her to be happy, he must die.The teenager, who recalled everything, stood awake all night.He shed tears after seeing her.\u2026Lu Zhen looked at the girl in front of him and sighed softly.Rubbing the skin under her eyes, he whispered, \u201cNo one compares to you.\u201dThere will only be\u00a0one\u00a0of you.Chu Yin lowered her head and said nothing.She had two chances. Because of her intense hatred, she directly went to Lu Zhen, intending to kill him, but she couldn\u2019t. The second time, she was sent back to her younger days and was given a chance to rewrite everything.Lu Zhen held her face and kissed Chu Yin\u2019s eyes softly.Chu Yin\u2019s heart was filled with unresolvable emotions. She punched him in the chest with her fist, \u201cDon\u2019t kiss.\u201dThere was a muffled sound.Lu Zhen said with a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201dChu Yin touched her face.Only to realize she was shedding tears.It\u2019s embarrassing.Chu Yin rubbed her cheeks and pushed him away. \u201cLu Zhen, I should kill you, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Lu Zhen said with a smile, holding her on the washing table with his arms on both sides, \u201cbut you didn\u2019t.\u201dChu Yin wrinkled her red nose.\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Lu Zhen kissed her tears a little bit, \u201cSo I\u2019m here.\u201dChu Yin was so upset.Trapped in Lu Zhen\u2019s arms, she could only push him hard: \u201cDon\u2019t kiss.\u201dLu Zhen held her cheek against her forehead. His eyes darkened.\u201cChu Yin,\u201d he said with a gentle smile, \u201cthis is not a kiss.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

On her second, she was given the ability to modify the plot.\u2014Because this garbage script collapsed.Once the male lead\u2019s will and motivation collapsed, the world would no longer function. Only this would the special forces intervene.The strongest wish that Lu Zhen left in his previous life was for her to be happy, so the system authority was handed over to her.Chu Yin, who obtained this golden finger, carried out her plan to kill Lu Zhen, but in the end, she used her golden finger to save him.Chu Yin breathed out softly after a long time.This information was hard to digest.\u2014But to Lu Zhen, those were no longer important.For him, he had died many times. He could finally start anew in this life.Lu Zhen touched her forehead and rubbed her ears. His voice was slightly hoarse, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. Do you need me to teach you?\u201dChu Yin returned to her senses.\u201cThis is not a kiss.\u201dAs soon as she raised her eyes, she bumped into his dark eyes and saw his desires. Her heartbeat heavily as her fingers subconsciously clutched the corner of her clothes.Body of a minor, but the soul of an adult.Chu Yin knew the status quo very well.But she refused.\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Chu Yin pursed her lips and backed away: \u201cRestraint yourself!\u201dLu Zhen smiled and lowered his head: \u201cChu Yin, I\u2019m already very restrained.\u201dHe pressed himself closer to her slowly and carefully.A little closer\u2026Chu Yin quickly pushed him by the hand before a sudden thought emerged in her mind.\u201cNo, what about the female lead in the book?\u201d She said while her hand was resting on Lu Zhen\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYour official match.\u201dLu Zhen hugged her and rubbed her neck. \u201cI don\u2019t know. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dMaybe there was such a person? But he didn\u2019t care about it at all.Because his world stopped the moment, she left.Chu Yin kicked Lu Zhen away, then jumped off the sink, and stood a safe distance away.She held her arms and said righteously: \u201cI\u2019m underage. You don\u2019t want to break the law.\u201dLu Zhen said, \u201cIt will soon be the coming of age ceremony.\u201dChu Yin: \u201cI\u2019m not yet an adult.\u201dLu Zhen curled his lips: \u201cI know. I\u2019ll wait.\u201dChu Yin glared at him: \u201c\u2026I forbid you to wait!\u201dHe was responding as if she was giving him permission once she became an adult!A kiss was nothing in her previous life. Still, in this life, her main priority was only studying before the truth was discovered.Not that she thought about it; sneaking into the toilet room with him was ambiguous. It was her mistake as she was only trying to figure out the identity of her \u2018stand-in.\u2019She coughed twice, walking out first with her hands behind her back as if to escape from the scene of the crime.Lu Zhen still followed her calmly.After leaving the movie theater, Chu Yin saw a person on the side of the road.Song Zhaolin was quietly crouching on the side of the road, holding a left-over bamboo stick from the grilled intestines. He watched them walk out one by one.His innocent big eyes clearly read: I need an explanation.Chu Yin: \u201cAre you waiting for me?\u201dSong Zhaolin murmured. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for an explanation.\u201dChu Yin had a slightly guilty conscience, but Lu Zhen was very calm: \u201cGo ask.\u201dSong Zhaolin\u2019s eyes went back and forth. He shook the bamboo stick as he asked: \u201cWhat did you two do without me?\u201dAfter finishing speaking, he couldn\u2019t hold back and covered his mouth as he started laughing.Song Zhaolin thought of \u2018adultery.\u2019 His mind was full of things not suitable for children. Even though he tried to conceal it, his whole body was full of obscenity.Chu Yin\u2019s hands were itchy. She, in all her efforts, resisted the urge to beat him: \u201cWe did nothing.\u201dSong Zhaolin, with a face of disbelief, turned his head to Lu Zhen for confirmation.The corners of Lu Zhen\u2019s lips curled slightly. There was a hint of joy in his expression.His gaze swept across Chu Yin and then fell on Song Zhaolin: \u201cWe\u2026\u201dPaused meaningfully\u2026as if something happened.Song Zhaolin\u2019s tail shaking and his ears went up high: \u201cWhat, what?\u201dAdvertisementsChu Yin saw a hint of dark motives in Lu Zhen\u2019s eyes \u2013 Once Song Zhaolin knows something, the whole school will know about it tomorrow.So she turned over the script decisively and directly silenced Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen was about to open his mouth and say, \u201cWe did nothing. I just hugged her.\u201d but noticed a force silencing him.It was like having two forces in front of him \u2013 one was his will, the other was an external force giving him instructions. However, unlike before, Lu Zhen realized he could choose any one of them.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He grimaced when he saw Chu Yin leaving.\u201cDon\u2019t go! I haven\u2019t finished talking hey\u2013\u201d Song Zhaolin stretched out his hand, but Chu Yin left without a second thought.He turned his head and blinked his eyes to look at Lu Zhen: \u201cBrother Zhen, what\u2019s the matter with you two?\u201dAs a big melon eater, he certainly knew that there were many people in the school gnawing on the news of them. Just now, while squatting on the road, there were already posts in the forum talking about the movie theater .-Lu Zhen and Chu Yin were sitting together!Watch a movie together! Even if it was a boring documentary, this behavior was similar to what a couple would do.Song Zhaolin rubbed his hands and said, \u201cAre you two together?\u201dLu Zhen retracted his gaze and said, \u201cI\u2019m chasing her unilaterally.\u201d\u2026I can really speak.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes and chuckled.It turned out that his words and deeds were no longer bound by anyone.He was still willing to surrender to her, but\u2026 he had some advantages.Song Zhaolin called out. \u201cOh my God!\u201dLu Zhen was chasing a girl. If it was in the past, Song Zhaolin and Tan Ke wouldn\u2019t believe it, but it was reasonable if the target was Chu Yin.\u201cThen how\u2019s your progress, CEO Lu!\u201d Song Zhaolin raised his hand wryly and hooked his flexible little finger, \u201cHave you held hands?\u201dLu Zhen glanced at him and smiled ambiguously.Song Zhaolin had been an innocent little fool for the past two lifetimes. Much more than he could imagine.But Chu Yin didn\u2019t want him to say it. She even silenced him.Lu Zhen had a lot of patience.He wouldn\u2019t want to disturb her studying time for her college entrance examination.After the college entrance examination\u2026Song Zhaolin sighed very understandingly when he saw that he was not talking: \u201cOh, it\u2019s okay. You\u2019re still a human! Sister Yin is a person difficult to chase, so, normally, you haven\u2019t held her hands yet!\u201dLu Zhen: \u201c\u2026\u201dPatience\u2026patience\u2026He wanted everyone to know his secret desires.Know that she was his.Even if not in this present, but the future.\u2026Chu Yin deeply reflected. \u201cI think I\u2019m slacking off lately.\u201dXueji looked at the new workbook that she had just finished on her desk: \u201c\u2026not really?\u201dChu Yin corrected the mistake while saying: \u201cI\u2019ve lost some of my energy after the miserable experience of that dog man.\u201dXueji looked at her as she wrote. \u201cYou\u2019re overthinking, host.\u201dThe speed of Chu Yin\u2019s writing could be described as fast. Take Mathematics as an example. She had been answering and correcting the hard questions repeatedly. With her super memory and good logical thinking, those problems were like cutting vegetables.She often did it in class. Those stack of papers estimated for two types were answered by Chu Yin in one class sitting.Her level of other subjects was also improving day by day. Chu Yin was an organized person. After her daily system tasks were done, she steadily studied for her college entrance examination.After correcting all the wrong questions, Chu Yin put the workbook aside and took a drink.\u201cSo what about my task for the college entrance examination? When will it be released?\u201dXueji: \u201cIt\u2019s not the time yet, host.\u201dChu Yin snorted.She could guess the task. It was probably to be placed first in the college entrance examination.She had made a lot of progress with simulating the exam. Chu Yin was confident.She was more interested in what the task reward was.Chu Yin thought that the highest peak of their academic career was the college entrance examination for students. After entering university, although they still needed to learn, the mode was utterly different from that of high school.Correspondingly, what was the highest reward?If the capacity continues to expand, it would be a whole page? Or was there any other modification method?However, what Xueji said was correct. It was indeed not yet time to release it.After the coming-of-age ceremony, there was still one left for her to stabilize her rhythm.Now, she was answering another English test.Chu Yin finished all the selected parts in more than 40 minutes. As she put down the pen, she was patted on the shoulder by the English teacher: \u201cGo to the office. The headteacher called for you.\u201d\u201cOh, okay.\u201d Chu Yin spread the paper on the table, left her seat, and walked towards the office.As soon as she left, Song Zhaolin\u2019s eyes drifted over.Before he could even look at it, the English teacher turned back.Advertisements\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to answer your test paper with your own abilities, you don\u2019t have to answer!\u201d the English teacher yelled at him.Song Zhaolin flinched back quickly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one is more suitable than you in the third year of our school.\u201dEvery year of the adult ceremony, representatives would be selected to speak. Chu Yin had a good appearance and good grades. She was adored by most of the students. Because of this, she was the best candidate to be the spokesperson.Chu Yin had no experience as a spokesperson, so she raised her hand and rubbed the tip of her nose: \u201cBut, I don\u2019t know what to say.\u201dThe headteacher waved her hand: \u201cIt\u2019s okay. You can find references online. People don\u2019t really care about the content.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t pressure yourself. Standing on the stage will already incite the students.\u201dChu Yin had no reason to refuse, so she had to agree.Walking out of the office, she met Han Chuying, \u201cAre you the school spokesperson this year?\u201dChu Yin raised her eyebrows: \u201cHow do you know?\u201dHan Chuying confidently said: \u201cIf it\u2019s not you, I\u2019ll make trouble!\u201dChu Yin was speechless for a moment.Han Chuying excitedly asked: \u201cSo what are you going to wear for the coming-of-age ceremony? Have you thought about it? Do you want me to prepare it for you!!\u201dChu Yin: \u201cAlthough I haven\u2019t thought it out yet, don\u2019t bother.\u201dHan Chuying: \u201cNo trouble! It\u2019s not troublesome at all!\u201dShe had generated ten sets of clothes in her brain, each of which was very stunning. Her sister must be the most beautiful in this year\u2019s coming-of-age ceremony! She had to!However, Han Chuying still respected Chu Yin. \u201cYin Yin, you have to prioritize yourself, but if you don\u2019t know what to wear, please find me! I will definitely design it well!\u201dChu Yin was afraid of her: \u201cGood, good, I see.\u201dChu Yin didn\u2019t have any idea about her dress for the coming-of-age ceremony.In her previous life, the Chu family\u2018s financial condition was good. Chu Qiuqiu was still in Huiwen. At that time, the family seemed to have custom-made dresses for them.But now, there was no such condition, and Chu Yin didn\u2019t want to waste her energy, so she planned to buy a dress at the mall before the rite of passage.But when school was over, she suddenly received a call from Chu Shi.\u201cYin Yin, is the school coming-of-age ceremony coming?\u201d Chu Shi asked, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about the dress, just concentrate on studying. Your brother will help you prepare!\u201dChu Yin breathed a sigh of relief. She didn\u2019t have to pick it up by herself.\u201cDon\u2019t buy expensive ones, just pick anything ordinary. Thank you, brother.\u201dDon\u2019t worry! Don\u2019t thank me. It\u2019s my duty as your brother.\u201d\u2026A few days later, Chu Yin came back to the dormitory after class, and the dormitory aunt stopped her with a smile.\u201cGirl! Come on, someone gave you something \u2014 \u201cChu Yin walked over and saw that it was a big gift box with high-grade suede. As soon as she saw the logo, she knew that it was the dress bought by her brother.The economic situation of the entire Chu family should not be perfect now. The Haute Couture bought by her brother was still very expensive. Chu Yin sighed lightly.\u201cThe guy who gave this box is so handsome!\u201d The aunt looked at her teasingly and blinked, \u201cBoyfriend?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s my brother.\u201dChu Yin thanked the aunt, got her things ready, and was about to go upstairs. At this moment, her phone rang.After answering the call, Chu Shi\u2019s voice could be heard. \u201cYin Yin, I\u2019m downstairs in your dormitory. Come here.\u201dChu Yin was stunned. The dress had already been sent. What else could her brother do?She had no time to go upstairs, so she went out with the gift box in her hand.Then she saw that Chu Shi was also holding two boxes in his hands.Chu Yin\u2019s heart moved, and suddenly a thought came up.Before it could be confirmed, a familiar smiling voice sounded behind her: \u201cHave you seen it?\u201dChu Yin looked back abruptly and saw Lu Zhen holding a shoebox in his hand, looking at her with a smile.\u201cYou bought it?\u201d Chu Yin nodded towards the box in her hand.\u201cYeah,\u201d Lu Zhen nodded, his lips curled up, \u201cThe size should be right.\u201dChu Yin: \u201c\u2026!\u201dAt this time, Chu Shi had also walked over and looked at Lu Zhen, only to know that he was one step ahead.The two men looked at each other, a ray of fire burst into the air.Chu Shi was the first to speak: \u201cMr. Lu, you\u2019re so busy, but you still have time to buy a dress for my sister?\u201dLu Zhen looked indifferently, \u201cWell, because I am courting her.\u201dA straight shot.Chu Shi and Chu Yin choked and coughed at the same time.Although he knew that Lu Zhen sacrificed his life to save his sister, Chu Shi still had his old beliefs about Lu Zhen.Want to court his sister? It will be eight hundred years later.He handed the box in his hand to Chu Yin and said softly, \u201cI think you will like it.\u201dChu Yin took it: \u201cOkay, thank you, brother.\u201dLu Zhen walked over and took all the things in Chu Yin\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019ll bring it up for you.\u201dChu Shi was immediately dissatisfied: \u201cWait a minute! How dare you enter her room?!\u201d\u201cIt was originally a dormitory for all genders.\u201d Lu Zhen looked up at him faintly and smiled. \u201cBesides, I\u2019ve been in before.\u201dChu Shi was angry: \u201cYou\u2013\u201cChu Yin didn\u2019t want them to continue fighting, so she had to pull one to go first. She irritably pushed Lu Zhen: \u201cif you want to send them, just send them. Just go.\u201dShe glanced at Chu Shi again: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, brother, I will send him away after he finishes bringing my things.\u201dLu Zhen laughed.In the end, Chu Shi had no choice but to watch the man enter the dormitory with his sister.How can this happen! His sister used to insult Lu Zhen with him!Why doesn\u2019t she hate Lu Zhen as much as before? QAQ!There were few people in the building now. The dormitory aunt talked to them. After a few sentences, she let them go.Holding the four boxes, Lu Zhen walked to Chu Yin\u2019s floor and put everything at her dormitory door.Chu Yin turned around and looked at him: \u201cOkay, I will wear what my brother bought. You can take your gift back.\u201dLu Zhen lowered his eyes, put one hand on the door of the dormitory, and asked with a chuckle, \u201cDo you want to see first? See what he picked.\u201dChu Yin looked at him suspiciously.But she still squatted down and opened Chu Shi\u2019s box.As far as the eye can see, it was a striking dress with orange, pink colors.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This color was popular this year. Chu Shi chose the tulle lotus leaf sleeve style, which would make the person wearing look like an immortal fairy.\u2026But not for her.Chu Yin generally didn\u2019t want to wear this color.A chuckle came from the top of her head. Lu Zhen bent over and held her wrist.\u201cSo, take mine.\u201dChu Yin frowned and looked at him.Lu Zhen smiled and rubbed her face.\u201cThe goods have been delivered. Return and exchange are not supported.\u201d\u201cSee you at the coming-of-age ceremony.\u201dFearing that she would refuse, he quickly strode away.Chu Yin looked down at the box on the ground and sighed after a long time. She had to carry all the boxes into the dormitory first, then opened Lu Zhen\u2019s chest and took out the dress to take a look.This was a tiny black dress with a sharp cut on the waist. It didn\u2019t expose too much skin. The skirt was pleated, and the length was above the knee. The whole dress was embroidered with intricate flowers and decorated with streamer beads.Dog man knew her style.Chu Yin hesitated for a long time.She didn\u2019t need two dresses, so she just returned the other one to her brother.She searched on the Internet, only to find similar styles, not knowing if he customized it. The shoes were also of the same brand, with thin high heels, still precisely to her taste.In the end, Chu Yin had to transfer the money for the dress and shoes to Lu Zhen at a similar style of the same brand.Her heart was bleeding when she transferred the money.But she had to admit that she liked the style Lu Zhen picked.The next day was the coming-of-age ceremony.The school\u2019s auditorium had been decorated, and the door was renovated specially for this ceremony. Students had to walk through this door as part of the tradition.This day was an occasion for everyone to compete for beauty. Huiwen never lacks Bai Fumei (White, Rich, and Beautiful) students. All the spring and autumn set dresses could be seen in the auditorium. It was dazzling for a moment.Chu Yin\u2019s speech would commence early, so she was already preparing backstage.With her black dress.All the people backstage dared not speak loudly, holding their breath.Is this, this, this their university God Chu Yin!!They only remembered Chu Yin wearing a little dress at last year\u2019s ball, but she was very perfunctory at that time. She was still wearing a warm knitted skirt \u2013 but today! She was stunning!The texture of the high-end dress was completely different. The pure hand-made skirt naturally had a sense of high fashion. The pinched waist design drew out her narrow waistline. Her shoulders looked white and soft, like a piece of warm porcelain in the light.Chu Yin was born with red lips, white teeth, and pure facial features, but when she gently raised her head to read, she had a kind of inexplicable beauty.The host and staff were about to cry.At this time, there was also a commotion in the field.\u201cDamn, Lu Zhen\u2019s suit is such a killer!!\u201d\u201cAh ahh!! I\u2019m shaking again-\u201d\u201cMy former husband is still so handsome~\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s black hair was tied up, revealing clear and deep eyes. His skin was cold and white, and his tear mole and lips showed an unspeakable cold and abstinence.His figure was masculine and tall. He was wearing a black handmade suit tailored for him with a flower brooch pressed on his chest.Lu Zhen looked around and didn\u2019t see her.Soon, the coming-of-age ceremony began.The students and some parents of each class took their seats. The host went on the stage and then asked the principal to give a speech.While the principal spoke, the people underneath were taking selfies with excitement.There were still many people secretly taking pictures of Lu Zhen.Ten minutes later, the principal\u2019s message finally ended. The next part was the student representative\u2019s speech.Class 5 cheered immediately.Han Chuying instantly took out a DSLR from nowhere and pointed it at the podium.The girl came out from backstage and walked to the microphone step by step.She wore the dress he gave her. Lu Zhen silently chuckled.He put a lot of thought into these details.The flowers on his chest and the embroidery on the hem of his back were all the same style as her.There was a secret and exclusive connection between them.The audience was so quiet as if the pause button had been pushed.\u201cHello, teachers and students, I am Chu Yin from the third year of class 5.\u201dWith this sentence, their spirit recovered and cheered again. This time it was more potent than the last time. Everyone was staring at the person on the stage.The smile on Lu Zhen\u2019s lips gradually disappeared.AdvertisementsThere were many sounds of admiration in the audience, and countless pairs of eyes were staring at her.Lu Zhen suddenly realized that the dress he picked was too short.Chu Yin\u2019s legs were white and slender. Her beautiful shoulders and neckline were exposed. It was as white as porcelain, so moist as if they were shining.Lu Zhen started to get hot from the bottom of his heart. His irritation surged up as he continued to look at her.After a few seconds, he got up and left the seat.The speech that Chu Yin prepared was concise, and it was over in less than five minutes.She clutched her collar and bowed slightly, then stepped down amid the warm applause from everyone.The host who met her blushed.\u201cSenior Sister is awesome!\u201d\u201cSenior Sister, go and rest!\u201dChu Yin smiled: \u201cOkay.\u201dShe walked down the stairs backstage when she was suddenly caught by her wrist.Lu Zhen was waiting for her here.Chu Yin almost yelled. \u201cAre you a ghost!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s fingertips were very hot, holding her wrist. He subconsciously rubbed it a few times.\u201cChu Yin, change your dress.\u201d Lu Zhen said.Chu Yin looked at him in surprise: \u201cWhy?\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s voice was low: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s not good-looking.\u201dHe picked it out by himself. How could it not be good-looking? Chu Yin didn\u2019t believe it was because she didn\u2019t look good. She frowned and looked at him for a long while and then suddenly figured it out.Chu Yin hooked the corners of her lips and suddenly moved closer.Lu Zhen\u2019s breath suddenly touched her with a light fragrance, and his fingers tightened.\u201cI bought it.\u201d the girl\u2019s breath was sweet. Her teasing was provocative. \u201cI\u2019ll wear it.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s heart instantly beat rapidly.She would always have a significant influence on him.After Chu Yin finished speaking, she planned to leave and go out.Lu Zhen subconsciously pulled her back, then turned around and gently pressed her against the wall, using his body to block her tightly.\u201cIt\u2019s not over?\u201d Chu Yin glared at him.Lu Zhen lowered his eyes, looking at her rosy lips under the light. He wanted to take a bite.Make a mark.She was his.He knew how to control the rhythm, knew how to restrain himself.But at this moment, he was still driven by instinct, like a demon.He lowered his head to get close to her.Chu Yin immediately noticed it and quickly reached out to cover her lips.Lu Zhen\u2019s kiss fell on the back of her hand.He tossed her around for a moment, then took a bite of her.It\u2019s just a little flesh.Chu Yin \u201chissed\u201d and scolded him aloud: \u201cAre you a dog!\u201dHe really shouldn\u2019t tease him. Dog man is really a dog!!!\u201cWell,\u201d Lu Zhen released her. He kissed the knuckles he had bitten and pressed her into his arms, \u201cChu Yin, grow up quickly.\u201dShe wasn\u2019t yet an adult even after this ceremony.She was still young and had to take the college entrance examination.Grow up quickly so they could be together.Chu Yin couldn\u2019t move, so she had to beat him hard: \u201cCan I control my growth?\u201dLu Zhen buried her in his warm neck and chuckled.\u201cThe day you became an adult\u2026\u201d He remembered some details of his past life. His heart was warm and tender. \u201cI kissed you for the first time.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face suddenly reddened.When she became an adult in her previous life, it was already after she graduated from high school.Lu Zhen celebrated her eighteenth birthday, and under the stars, he secretly kissed her.\u201cOh, I remember,\u201d Chu Yin\u2019s cheeks were hot, her tone pretending to be calm, \u201cI almost slapped you at the time.\u201dLu Zhen squeezed the back of her neck.\u201cUm\u2026 but when I lowered my head to kiss you.\u201dLu Zhen bit her earlobe and whispered, \u201c\u2013you closed your eyes.\u201dSo grow up quickly.Love me again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because she felt shame remembering what she did, she pushed him away in her short black dress.Lu Zhen had no choice but to follow her helplessly.The dress looked better on her.Lu Zhen had to think of a way to return her money.Han Chuying was already carrying the DSLR when Chu Yin came back to the audience seat.\u201cDon\u2019t move! Yeah, keep this pose!\u201dHan Chuying came up and wildly snapped photos.She was too far away from the stage to see the details. Now that she was closer to Chu Yin, she could how beautiful she was! The short black dress made her complexion whiter plus with her exquisite face, she felt she couldn\u2019t breathe anymore.But just after taking two shots, a figure suddenly appeared in the lens.Han Chuying was dissatisfied, looking up from behind the camera: \u201cHey, that classmate-\u201cShe couldn\u2019t finish her sentence when she recognized the classmate.Although she only liked beautiful sisters, a term like \u201cbeauty\u201d had gone beyond the concept of gender.Han Chuying was stunned. She then keenly noticed that the flower brooch pinned to Lu Zhen\u2019s chest was very similar to the beaded embroidery on Chu Yin\u2019s dress.Damn! Were they showing off?She reluctantly raised the camera again and pointed at Chu Yin: \u201cYin Yin, look at the camera!\u201dChu Yin smiled helplessly and looked at the camera. The boy in a black suit, who was 2 to 3 meters behinds her, turned his head slightly and looked over.Click.In that photo, the beautiful girl was smiling at the camera, and behind her was a young man silently watching her.Even beyond the camera lens, one could feel the passion of the man.Han Chuying, too, couldn\u2019t help looking at the camera for a long time.\u201cIs it okay now?\u201d Chu Yin asked her.Han Chuying returned to her senses: \u201cOh oh oh! It\u2019s okay! Thank you!\u201dA solo photo of Chu Yin looked beautiful but she had to admit, that the photo of Chu Yin and Lu Zhen looked amazing.Chu Yin was usually photographed by her, so she didn\u2019t bother to look at the photos, and went back after taking them.The next step was to organize all classes to walk under the renovated \u2018door of adulthood\u2019. This process was simple and boring, but because girls could show off their bodies, they liked this phase.When Chu Yin came back, the class monitor said happily, \u201cNow that you\u2019re here, you may proceed to the platoon.\u201d\u2013He didn\u2019t finish his sentence when he suddenly saw Lu Zhen behind Chu Yin.Wasn\u2019t he in the international class? ? Why was he here in Class 5?It was not only him who was watching but all the students in the venue were.Lu Zhen\u2019s expression was calm and indifferent.The young master stood in the eyes of countless people, still cold and dignified.Chu Yin felt helpless: \u201cHe wants to be here.\u201d After all, he couldn\u2019t persuade President Lu.Chu Yin went through the door. As soon as she looked up, she saw Song Zhaolin taking pictures of her and Lu Zhen. He looked like a proud aunt.Chu Yin: \u201c\u2026\u201dAt this time, the forum went crazy again.[ Ah! my husband and my wife went through the door together!! I announce that they are officially married today! ]Anonymous 1: I\u2019m a witness!Anonymous 2: I\u2019m the flower girl!Anonymous 4: I can host the ceremony!No one could rival Song Zhaolin post:Anonymous 21: I declare that I am their beloved son\u2013!!The people underneath his comment laughed:Anonymous 22: Hahahahaha!Anonymous 23: Hahahahaha!The \u201cpassing door\u201d was over, the next phase was ballroom dancing.Today, all the students wore formal clothes and tuxedos. Everyone present was free to invite anyone.Lu Zhen was always next to Chu Yin, and even though many people were staring at them, no one dared to come over.They stood side by side with their shoulders close together. He smiled and asked, \u201cDo you want to dance?\u201dChu Yin glared at him, \u201cDo you want to be trampled to death by me?\u201dShe couldn\u2019t dance even if Lu Zhen taught her many times in their last life. Every time they attend occasions where dance sessions were present, Lu Zhen would frequently be trampled in the feet by her.Lu Zhen also remembered. The corners of his lips slightly curled up.AdvertisementsAs they watched the excited young students in the auditorium, a sense of time had passed away.Only the two of them knew.They stayed in the same spot yet no one dared to invite them to dance.Zhao Yuxiong and several other boys from Class 5 looked at the picture of them standing side by side in dismay.They dressed in the same color, same fair and beautiful. They had to admit that these two were so beautiful no one could reach them.The squad leader patted them on the shoulders: \u201cLet\u2019s give up.\u201dAfter today, who didn\u2019t know they were a couple?Zhao Yuxiong: \u201cAre they really together?\u201dThe squad leader lightly punched him. \u201cEven if they\u2019re not together, can you dare?\u201dEven if there was no \u2018Lu Zhen\u2019, there was still \u2018study\u2019.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fu Mingxuan and Liang Yueqi once again stood on the united front.\u201cLu Zhen likes her?\u201d Fu Mingxuan bit her lip.Liang Yueqi frowned as she looked at the two figures in the distance.It was obvious before, but it after Lu Zhen got better, he became more and more immune to Chu Yin\u2019s indifference.\u201cLu Zhen likes unruly people,\u201d Liang Yueqi hugged her arms and watched Chu Yin\u2019s fierce look when she turned her head to talk to Lu Zhen, \u201cShe is bold and strong.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Fu Mingxuan asked immediatelyLiang Yueqi pointed at Chu Yin with her chin: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t like this before, did you forget?\u201dFu Mingxuan recalled. She was stunned when Chu Yin first transferred to the school. She didn\u2019t speak. She was a dull person, not the same as she was now.\u201cI\u2019m guessing she was pretending before, just to create a sense of contrast.\u201d Liang Yueqi analyzed, \u201cThat will attract Lu Zhen\u2019s curiosity.\u201dFu Mingxuan\u2019s eyes widened: \u201cThen she is too scheming!\u201dLiang Yueqi sneered: \u201cThis kind of sly person will marry into the Lu\u2019s house?\u201dFu Mingxuan was angry. \u201cThen you will just give up like this after seeing them?\u201dLiang Yueqi didn\u2019t say a word.The more she thought about it, the more upset she got.Liang Yueqi stood still watching Chu Yin, with a mocking smile on her lips.While Fu Mingxuan had an idea.At the end of the social dance, there was a photo session. Everyone was free to take photos. They could take photos with parents, classmates, or with their teachers.Fu Mingxuan walked through the crowd and walked straight to Lu Zhen. She blushingly asked, \u201cBrother Zhen, we\u2019re going to graduate soon. Can we take a photo together?\u201dChu Yin was right next to Lu Zhen. There were already many classmates. Cautiously gathered around to take a photo, but because of Lu Zhen\u2019s presence, he dared not approach.Chu Yan was beside Lu Zhen. Many students carefully tried to ask for photos but couldn\u2019t dare to approach him.Hearing Fu Mingxuan\u2019s voice, she immediately turned around and waved to Lu Zhen: \u201cGo ahead.\u201dLu Zhen raised her eyes and looked at the people gathered around Chu Yin.There were many boys. He squinted slightly, raised his hand and pulled her, and gently took her to his side.\u201cWe take it together.\u201dFu Mingxuan was stunned: \u201cThis\u2026\u201dBut her mobile phone was already in someone else\u2019s hands. The person who held the phone was standing opposite to them: \u201cThis, this-a little closer!\u201dFu Mingxuan couldn\u2019t dare refuse and shyly took a step closer to Lu Zhen.Lu Zhen was expressionless as he put his arm on Chu Yin\u2019s shoulder.Chu Yin felt cold on her shoulder and touched Lu Zhen\u2019s metal cuff. She looked at him with her face and lowered her voice. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201dLu Zhen whispered in her ear: \u201cAfter this photo is taken, save a copy and cut off the side.\u201dChu Yin was speechless and amused.How can a dog man be so naive\u2014!!Although Fu Mingxuan was uncomfortable because Chu Yin joined, she immediately showed a sweet smile when the photo was taken.It was a rare opportunity to have a photo with Lu Zhen, even if there was an eyesore in the photo, it was enough to cut off Chu Yin anyway.After taking the photo, she immediately ran over to look at it excitedly.She felt that she was standing very close to Lu Zhen, but after seeing the photo, she seemed to be splashed down by a basin of cold water.There was a palm distance between her and Lu Zhen, but Lu Zhen was leaning close to Chu Yin.His arms were resting on Chu Yin\u2019s shoulders, The corners of the young man\u2019s lips were curled with a faint smile, his head tilted slightly towards Chu Yin.It was a kind of intimacy no one could get in.Fu Mingxuan became a fool play for them to show their affection!Her face was red and white. IIn the end she could only direct her anger on the person who took the photo: \u201cHow did you take the photo?!\u201dThe other person was innocent: \u201cI just took it directly.\u201dFu Mingxuan: \u201cThen you should\u2019ve told me!\u201dThe other party was also speechless.How to tell you?\u2026Chu Yin took many photos with her classmates.Lu Zhen was pulled back by the International Class. He took photos with Tan Ke and the teachers.When Chu Yin was free from her classmates, she decided to change her dress so she could go back to studying.But as soon as she passed the corner of the stairs, she met Liang Yueqi head-on.Since the winter camp, Liang Yueqi hadn\u2019t shown her face in public. The two of them hadn\u2019t met since then.At this time, she, in her elegant dress, stood in front of Chu Yin with her arms folded.\u201cI can\u2019t see if it\u2019s a good method.\u201dAdvertisementsChu Yin: \u201c?\u201dLiang Yueqi encouraged Fu Mingxuan just to see Lu Zhen\u2019s reaction. When she observed from a distance, she found that Lu Zhen was interested in Chu Yin.All she had to do was try to beat her in this game.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She understood. In her last life, Lu Zhen rebelled and refused to marry. At that time, he was still immature and was under great pressure from his family.This life\u2026 seems to be more comfortable.Liang Yueqi said with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m doing this for you. I\u2019m afraid you will sink into the mud because of Lu Zhen\u2019s temporary love. But you have to know the current situation, the Chu family has fallen \u2013 of course, even if it hasn\u2019t fallen, it won\u2019t do anything. It will be difficult if you plant to marry into the Lu family.\u201dChu Yin\u2019s face was expressionless. She thought she was funny.It was almost time for the college entrance exam and yet she was thinking this kind of thing. No wonder her grades were bad.Liang Yueqi\u2019s family background gave her enough sense of superiority in front of Chu Yin, and when she left this warning, she thought she had the upper hand.\u201dFor your information, the Lu family and the Liang family made a verbal agreement a long time ago, and the children of the two families will be married in the future\u2026\u201dThe subtext is that she is the one who will become Lu Zhen\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Liang Yueqi finished speaking, observing Chu Yin\u2019s expression implicitly and triumphantly, wanting to see her panic or unbelievable look.The subtext was that she would become Lu Zhen\u2019s fiancee.After speaking, Liang Yueqi secretly observed Chu Yin\u2019s expression, hoping to see her panic look.But Chu Yin was very calm.Instead, a cold voice rang behind her.\u201cReally?\u201dLu Zhen walked a few steps to Chu Yin\u2019s side and looked at Liang Yueqi: \u201cThen we\u2019ll break the agreement today.\u201dLiang Yueqi\u2019s face paled, \u201cYou, what did you say?\u201dLu Zhen coldly said. \u201cI thought I was clear enough. If you still misunderstood, I am sorry.\u201dChu Yin tilted her head to one side, feeling that Liang Yueqi\u2019s expression at this time was a bit pitiful.Liang Yueqi was embarrassed, staring incredulously at him. \u201cWill you take responsibility for your words? Aren\u2019t you afraid that I will tell Grandpa?!\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s expression was very light. \u201cBe sure to tell him. Thank you.\u201dLiang Yueqi almost fainted with anger.In front of her rival, she simply couldn\u2019t bear the insult of being slapped in the face by the person she liked.Liang Yueqi turned around to leave.Not far away, the young man said again: \u201cAnd to clarify\u2026\u201dLiang Yueqi looked back at him.Lu Zhen pointed at Chu Yin.\u201dI\u2019m courting her. She hadn\u2019t answered me yet..\u201dWith this, Liang Yueqi\u2019s mentality completely collapsed.\u2026.The coming-of-age ceremony was over. The last activity of the senior high school students was over.In the next month, they had to focus on their college entrance examination.Chu Yin changed her dress and placed it in her small bag. Lu Zhen sent her back to the classroom.\u201cSo I will be very busy for the next month,\u201d Chu Yin said as she walked, \u201cyou are not allowed to talk to me.\u201dLu Zhen silently glanced at her.Not talking to her for a month\u2026It\u2019s a bit difficult.No, it\u2019s very difficult.Chu Yin stood still, poking his shoulder: \u201cThanks to you, the whole school now knew of our relationship. There will be commotion tomorrow.\u201dShe was afraid of this group of enthusiastic students. Couldn\u2019t they just focus on their college exams?Lu Zhen carefully took her hand and said softly, \u201cThen I will keep a low profile, okay?\u201dChu Yin threw his hand away: \u201cDon\u2019t you know how high-profile you are!!\u201dLu Zhen blinked.He looked innocent for a moment.Then he suddenly curled his lips and laughed, rubbing her wrist bone, \u201cAre you complimenting me?\u201dChu Yin glared: \u201cDon\u2019t think too much.\u201dIn short, in the month before the college entrance examination, she would never allow any mistakes, nor would allow anyone or anything to affect her study.\u2026Lu Zhen didn\u2019t disturb her. He would only visit during break time and gym class. If it wasn\u2019t for today\u2019s activity, he wouldn\u2019t have come.But\u2026 Chu Yin glanced at Lu Zhen secretly.Now the influence of the dog man was growing on her. This was not a good sign for a college entrance exam candidate.Chu Yin finished her daily study exercises and sat cross-legged on the bed to purify herself.Learning was currently the most important task.Lu Zhen\u2026she could throw him aside first.But now she couldn\u2019t completely ignore Lu Zhen.Chu Yin pondered for a while, then suddenly had an idea-AdvertisementsHow about if she used her golden finger!She flipped through the script. Although Lu Zhen didn\u2019t bother her, he still appeared occasionally. So she simply repeated the old tricks, changed the script, and put on the invisible man\u2019s vest again.1safe! \u221aPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Lu Zhen turned to the left, and after hiding to the corner, Chu Yin passed by after a while.After two times, Lu Zhen figured out the pattern.To learn, Chu Yin secretly used \u201csuperpowers\u201d to hide from him.Lu Zhen knew that he was indeed shaking her.Then to follow her wishes, he waited patiently until the college entrance examination.By mid of May, they had taken the three-mode of exams.The difficulty of the first model was moderate. The second mode was intermediate. Chu Yin finished cleanly finished them, ranking first.The third mode was easy. The purpose eas to increase the confidence of the candidates.The two-day exam was like carving flowers to Chu Yin.She had the time to correct general questions and rewrite them. The whole process was very easy.The school also worked fast. After two days, the results of their mock exams were given.As Chu Yin held her exam, she saw Lu Zhen in the corner of the corridor. She subconsciously paused before seeing Lu Zhen turning his head to talk to Tan Ke as if he didn\u2019t see her.Feelings of joy and sour emerged in her heart. Chu Yin shook her head and returned to the classroom with her paper.Tan Ke glanced at her and asked, \u201cBrother Zhen, aren\u2019t you going to visit her?\u201d He thought that Lu Zhen came to school to find Chu Yin.Lu Zhen looked at her when she turned around. Only then did he look back, and smiled faintly: \u201cWait.\u201dAfter the papers were issued, the class was beaming with joy.Song Zhaolin let out an excited roar: \u201cI passed!!\u201dHe got his personal best score ever on the test! Oh my God!Make sure to throw the paper in his brother\u2019s face tonight!Han Chuying came over to exchange results, heard his excited voice,\u00a0 and coolly said: \u201cYin Yin, my score is 730.\u201dSong Zhaolin: \u201c\u2026\u201dWhy let me know the cruelty of this world.Han Chuying smiled and watched him collapse.Chu Yin sighed. She still had to take care of her silly son.She patted Song Zhaolin\u2019s head: \u201cBut compared with the second mode, your score has narrowed by a few tenths. So, Linlin, you have improved.\u201dHan Chuying thought. That\u2019s because the topic had become simpler, and if the difficulty was a little more difficult, the difference would be high.But both she and Chu Yin knew that Song Zhaolin would foolishly believe.Sure enough, after listening to Chu Yin, his self-confidence rekindled: \u201cI know! I can!\u201dChu Yin nodded.: \u201cYes.\u201dWith the three-mode test paper, the teacher only taught the basics. It was the responsibility of the students to study more about it.After the report card came down, Chu Yin looked at her results in the first row. At this, a reminder sounded in her mind: \u201cDi\u2013\u201cShe had a hunch in an instant that this time it should be a task for the college entrance examination.Xueji: \u201cHost, I\u2019m here~\u201dXueji: \u201cDing Dong! Release the ultimate system task\u2014\u201dChu Yin was calm on the surface but subconsciously squeezed the pen in her hand.\u2014The ultimate task!The system played a tense BGM first before announcing. \u201cComplete the task of [Placing First in the College Entrance Exam.] . The difficulty index is 5 stars! ~ After the task is completed, you will obtain\u2026\u201dChu Yin was nervous.She expected that the task would be this. The important key was how much reward she would get after completing it.Was it modifying a whole page? Many paragraphs on many pages? Or arbitrarily modify within a certain time?She thought about many ways for the reward.But what Xueji said was: \u201cthe highest authority of\u2026 [self-made ending] ~\u201dChu Yin was stunned.She didn\u2019t recover for a long time.Xueji: \u201cHost? Hello, are you there?\u201dA little bit of excitement climbed into her bones.She never thought that it could be so big.It turned out that this was the \u201cultimate\u201d.As a character in the book, no matter how much she had permissions to modify, she was always under the guidance of the script. This world was still a world of fiction that could leave her speechless.If she could decide the ending, she had a chance for a smooth direction in her life. From then on, the content of the novel could stop. Because the only protagonist who could see the story had ushered the ending.\u2014It turned out that the ultimate reward was to finish this game.AdvertisementsThe excitement of being able to break away from everything made her tremble slightly.Can\u2019t wait to squeal in excitement.She wanted to tell everyone around that they were no longer under a role, and the world could run freely and lively.She wanted to tell Song Zhaolin, tell Jiang Yan, tell Han Chuying, tell those lovely people.But in the end, she found that the only person in the world who could share this excitement with her, and the only person who would understand her excitement,was Lu Zhen.Chu Yin stood up suddenly.She ran out of the classroom.Suddenly she wanted to tell Lu Zhen that would do something very powerful.If this would be done, they could finally be free.It felt so urgent for the first time.But no matter how she looked, she couldn\u2019t see Lu Zhen. Chu Yin thought for a while and ran to the rooftop, only to see Lu Zhen\u2019s figure flashing past the entrance of the corridor in the distance.\u2026backfired.She was trapped by her golden fingers, and now she couldn\u2019t find Lu Zhen.Chu Yin had to hurriedly chase from the other side, and at her speed, she should be able to meet Lu Zhen.But as soon as she passed by, Lu Zhen turned the corner and didn\u2019t see her.Chu Yin was anxious. She quickened her pace, chased Lu Zhen behind her, stretched out her arms, and grabbed the corner of his clothes.Lu Zhen\u2019s back froze.It\u2019s over.His pretend of matching her superpowers was over.Chu Yin finally caught him. She took a breath.Seeing that he didn\u2019t turn around, she grabbed the corner of his clothes and shook it slightly.Lu Zhen curled up his fingers on his side.She had the strength of a kitten. Gentle scratches as if acting like a baby.That power was still guiding him to move forward, but Lu Zhen just wanted to turn around and hug her now.The person in front of her still didn\u2019t respond, Chu Yin pursed her lips, and finally walked in front of him.Her hair was slightly disheveled. And her expression showed grievances.\u201cI caught you, can\u2019t you see me?\u201d she asked.Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t pretend anymore.He immediately stretched out his hand to hug her in his arms, rubbed her ear, and coaxed softly: \u201cI see you.\u201dI can only see you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because it was summer, the doors of the classrooms were open. There was a high possibility that someone might see them.Chu Yin hurriedly got out of his arms, pulled Lu Zhen\u2019s wrist, and took him to a corner.Lu Zhen held her backhand. Chu Yin tried to shake it away but couldn\u2019t.She also realized that her tone was a bit\u2026too delicate. Her face was hot now.Lu Zhen rubbed her palm, smiled, and bowed his head: \u201clooking for me?\u201dShe was running after him.Chu Yin shyly touched the tip of her nose before her excitement skyrocketed again when she remembered what she had to say.She lifted her face as her eyes sparkled. Her tone was full of irrepressible pride: \u201cI\u2019m planning to do the grandest thing ever.\u201dLu Zhen\u2019s lips curled up. He liked her.He lowered his eyes and asked her in a pampering tone: \u201cWhat\u2019s your big plan?\u201dChu Yin blinked and whispered. \u201cChange the world. Lu Zhen, you already know that we\u2019re still in this bounded world.\u201dAlthough they weren\u2019t bound by the rules of the world, they still live as characters in the book.Lu Zhen was slightly startled. He understood what she was talking about.The corners of Chu Yin\u2019s eyes and eyebrows flew with satisfaction: \u201cI will have the answer after the college entrance exam. I will be able to\u2026\u201dShe pursed her lips and held back\u2026\u2018-make my own ending\u2019 was so revealing she couldn\u2019t say it yet. Anyway, as long as Lu Zhen was still here, she would always have someone to show off.Even if Chu Yin didn\u2019t finish her sentence, Lu Zhen had enough information.He knew that Chu Yin\u2019s \u2018super power\u2019 could either be used at will or a certain value must be paid in exchange.Moreover, it was related to studying.No wonder she loves studying in this life. Lu Zhen couldn\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cSo amazing.\u201d He raised his hand and gently squeezed her earbones.\u201cSince you know I have this kind of superpower,\u201d Chu Yin hugged her arms, \u201cI have the final say in this world. You better hug my thigh. If you do, I might look kindly at you.\u201dLu Zhen stretched out his hand to hold her. He smiled: \u201cThen I\u2019ll follow you.\u201dChu Yin snorted proudly, then patted him away: \u201cIf you talk, just talk. Don\u2019t move your hands.\u201dShe said at the moment. The enthusiasm for learning is burning in her heart. In the next three weeks, she will let herself learn to the death.At that moment, her heart was burning with enthusiasm for studying. In the next three weeks, she would study until she couldn\u2019t.Lu Zhen guessed that the result of this college entrance exam played a vital role in her \u2018powers\u2019.He wouldn\u2019t disturb her next time.Today was the last day he would give way to his greed.He held the young girl, who would change the world, in his arms. As he kissed her softly on the ears, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t work too hard.\u201dLu Zhen wouldn\u2019t study abroad. He had plans.His academic background and management experience were enough in this life.Whether Chu Yin would end the rules of the world or not, he just wanted to stay with her even in the future.Chu Yin shrunk her neck to avoid his kisses.There can be no achievements without hard work, not to mention that this is a major event related to her future life.No pain, no gain.Not to mention this was a major event related to her future life.\u201cI won\u2019t bother you,\u201d Lu Zhen looked at her black pupils, \u201cbut you can come to me if you need anything.\u201dChu Yin snorted, \u201cI don\u2019t need you.\u201d\u201c\u2026if there is any,\u201d Lu Zhen said with a smile, \u201cI will show up in five minutes.\u201dChu Yin looked at him, then closed her eyes.Are you trying to be superman?\u2026During this time, as they were talking, a figure quickly escaped the corridor.This was the same student who accidentally bumped into their love quarrel that day. She didn\u2019t know how much luck she had to experience it the second time!Unlike the last time, the elder sister didn\u2019t beat the senior.Her face didn\u2019t frown in disdain too.Although the elder sister didn\u2019t have any expression on her face, she moved her hand to grab the corners of elder brother\u2019s clothes and pulled them lightly.Ahh!!This tsundere is so sweet! She was about to faint!Cp is true! ! It\u2019s all true!!Lu Zhen did what he said. In the last period, he didn\u2019t come to school again.He was also very busy. He had taken over half of the Lu family now, and he couldn\u2019t count the things he had to decide every day.He would take advantage of this to finish all his official business ahead of schedule so he could set his time for Chu Yin after the college entrance examination was over.AdvertisementsMost of the students entered a period of burnout.
