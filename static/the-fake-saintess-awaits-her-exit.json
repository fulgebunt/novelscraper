You\u2019re all getting tricked by that fake one!\u201dHer shouts continued again, but no one listened. They simply looked upon her with cold hatred.It was expected, considering who Yvelina was. She was someone who corrupted the Grand Temple by drowning in luxury and pleasure as soon as she had become the 49th Saintess. That wasn\u2019t all. She acted as if the Grand Temple\u2019s property was hers, and gave things out to those she favored. The people who received these things were usually those who flattered Yvelina or those she secretly called into her bed.There was no one in the continent that respected her anymore. Everyone spit as if they had said something dirty after mentioning Yvelina, and they wished for her to quickly return to God\u2019s side and receive consequences for her sins.And today was the day that the people\u2019s prayers would be fulfilled. There was a mountain of firewood below Yvelina\u2019s feet. It was firewood for today\u2019s burning at the stake ceremony. Soon, when the fire is lit, the notorious witch and fake Saintess, Yvelina, will meet the end of her life.* * *Since a year ago, there was a rumor that began popping up all over the continent.\u201cThey say the real Saintess appeared.\u201dThis rumor quickly spread throughout the land. A woman from the outskirts of the continent has holy powers so strong that it can\u2019t even be compared to that of the Saintess from the Grand Temple. She fights off monsters and heals the injured people before disappearing.\u201cI heard the real Saintess\u2019 name is Iris.\u201d\u201cThe monsters that attack whoever they see all run away when they see that Saintess, and she heals tens of people who are injured at the same time!\u201dThe people who had excitedly been spreading the rumors they heard became more and more cautious. Then they spoke in a lowered voice.\u201cBut there should only be one Saintess.\u201d\u201cWhich means\u2026 Saintess Yvelina from the Grand Temple is\u2026\u201dA fake Saintess.The people exchanged looks, not able to say the words.The rumors kept growing, and finally reached Yvelina\u2019s ears as well.\u201cGo find that girl immediately!\u201dThe temple\u2019s army that reluctantly followed Yvelina\u2019s orders found Iris. Right then, Iris, who was healing the injured people, spoke quietly to the temple\u2019s army.\u201cThere is no need to capture me. I will not run. But will you wait a bit until I finish healing the people here\u2026? Latban.\u201dLatban, the commander, and Iris already knew each other, and so he commanded the army to hold back. After Iris was finished, the people blocked her way as she approached the temple\u2019s army.\u201cRun away, Saintess! The fake Saintess will try to kill you!\u201d\u201cYes! We\u2019ll stop them, please run!\u201dIris smiled and shook her head at the people blocking her.\u201cI promised the knights that I would go with them. I must keep my promise.\u201dIris kissed the forehead of the child clinging onto her skirt after she said this.\u201cDon\u2019t cry. We\u2019ll meet again.\u201dThe people swallowed back their tears as Iris tried to calm them down, despite the fact that she must be the one who felt most nervous. The people began begging the knights once they realized Iris would go with them no matter how much they blocked her path.\u201cMiss Iris is the real Saintess!\u201d\u201cYou saw it right now too. Miss Iris healed us with her holy power!\u201d\u201cIf you are knights whose duty is to protect the Saintess, you must protect Miss Iris! The Saintess at the Grand Temple is fake!\u201dThe temple\u2019s army felt baffled at the people\u2019s begging. Before coming here, they did not doubt the fact that Iris was a fake Saintess. Which was expected, since there has never been a case where a different Saintess appeared while another existed in the past thousands of years. There were a few who claimed to be Saintesses, but they were all fake. So they had believed Iris would be a fake as well.The army escorted Iris politely. The power Iris had used just now to heal the people was most definitely holy power. They could be sure of it because as the army of the temple, they could feel it more clearly. On top of it, their commander, Latban, escorted Iris in the most respectful way he could.When Iris arrived at the Grand Temple, it was Yvelina who greeted her before anyone else.Yvelina approached Iris, who had her gaze lowered and was staying silent, and scanned her before she commanded,\u201cRaise your gaze.\u201dAt these words, Iris raised her gaze. Yvelina sneered. In the next moment, Iris\u2019 face was turned roughly along with a loud slapping noise. A red handprint was left on Iris\u2019 fair skin.\u201cAre you prepared to receive your punishment for pretending to be the Saintess and for fooling the people?\u201d\u201cSaintess!\u201dCommander Latban, who had brought Iris, shouted in surprise at Yvelina\u2019s actions. But Yvelina didn\u2019t stop there. She continued to slap Iris, and Iris ended up fainting. Then Yvelina became more enraged and began kicking her as well.\u201cYou bitch! People callyouthe Saintess? Did you think I wouldn\u2019t know that your holy power was created by the spells of evil heathens?!\u201dUnable to contain her anger, Yvelina kicked Iris\u2019 stomach. The priests, shocked at Yvelina\u2019s actions, tried to stop her. But this only helped Yvelina\u2019s anger grow.\u201cCut her head off immediately! She\u2019ll have to pay with her life for pretending to be the Saintess!\u201dBut Iris did not die that day. It was because the commander had stopped that order by putting his life on the line. The priests also quietly supported the commander.\u201cPlease calm down, Saintess Yvelina. I think it would be better to look into the matter a bit more.\u201d\u201cWhat good would that do?! She dared to tell the people that I\u2019m a fake\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s the spell of heathens, it could happen again. So it would be right to look into it now.\u201dYvelina grimaced when he said it could happen again, and reluctantly made an order.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll let her live. But imprison her in the basement prison of the Grand Temple.The basement prison of the Grand Temple. This was where the monsters captured by the holy knights were kept. There were all sorts of bugs, not a single ray of sunshine, and it was so wet and humid that it was hard to breathe. The people began talking when they heard Iris was imprisoned in such a place.\u201cI saw it clearly. Miss Iris really used holy powers.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. And in contrast\u2026 has anyone seen Saintess Yvelina use her holy powers recently?\u201dEveryone felt that something was wrong after hearing these words. Everyone had seen Iris\u2019 holy powers, but no one had seen Yvelina use hers since some time ago. Suspicions became convictions. It wasn\u2019t just the common people, either. Even the priests of the Grand Temple began raising their voices.Saintess Yvelina\u2019s holy powers are suspected of not existing.Yvelina became pale after hearing this, and went down to the basement prison. Then she raised the dagger she had hid and attempted to kill Iris, who was tied up in chains. If commander Latban hadn\u2019t become suspicious and followed her, Iris could\u2019ve died at Yvelina\u2019s hands at that moment.Yvelina began shouting when her attempt to murder Iris failed.\u201cThat girl! She stole my holy powers! There\u2019s no way all my holy powers could\u2019ve disappeared otherwise\u2026!\u201dAll the priests, who had belatedly come down, heard Yvelina\u2019s shouts. The priests asked with rigid expressions.\u201cIs that true? You don\u2019t have holy power anymore? Since when?!\u201dThe priests were now calling Yvelina \u201cyou\u201d instead of \u201cSaintess\u201d. Yvelina trembled at the priests\u2019 reactions, and escaped after pushing them away. After escaping the Grand Temple, Yvelina seeked help from those she had given her favor to. But there was no one who helped her.Meanwhile, the coronation of a new Saintess was held at the Grand Temple.The 49th Saintess, Yvelina, no longer existed.That name had been erased, and the name of Iris, the 49th Saintess, was being spread all over the continent.And today was the day Yvelina, who targeted Iris\u2019 life even as she ran away, would be burnt at the stake.\u201cKill the fake Saintess!\u201dThe gathered people spit at Yvelina, who was still claiming to be the real Saintess. Then they began talking among themselves.\u201cAnyway, it\u2019s a relief that the real Saintess is safe. I heard commander Latban protected Saintess Iris.\u201d\u201cYup, I heard it too. On top of it, I also heard his highness the crown prince of the empire, Leon, also helped out Saintess Iris. Apparently he showed respect for the Saintess\u2019 benevolence, and is staying in the Holy Nation to help her out.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not all. Even the king of mages, who despises temples, attended the coronation to congratulate Saintess Iris.\u201dSoon the executioners and priests appeared. When the priest standing in front began reading out the sins Yvelina committed, the people began roaring even louder for the fake Saintess to be killed. When the priest finished reading her sins after a long time, the executioner finally approached Yvelina and lit the fire below her feet.The wood began burning quickly thanks to the oil. Yvelina\u2019s voice, claiming that she is the real Saintess, faded into the flames.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the last of the fake Saintess.* * *The fake Saintess, who continuously committed sins, was dead.

Moreover, most patients had difficulties moving freely, and so they found things they could do while in bed.The most suitable thing was to play games or watch videos on your phone. If you got tired of that, you could read as well.That\u2019s how I spent my days as well. Since I was hospitalized for a long time, my parents visited me only about once a week, and I didn\u2019t have any friends who visited since I hadn\u2019t attended school for a long time. I did all sorts of things when I was first hospitalized, out of boredom. The person in the next bed said this when I was installing a social media app on my phone.\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to do that for long. It just brings your mood down afterwards.\u201dWhy would you say that to someone who is about to start using it? I ignored the remark with a frown. But I soon found out why. The only posts I could post while I was in the hospital all day were always the same. Instead, I saw every second of the daily lives of people outside.A person posting a picture of the subway saying they\u2019re late to an appointment with a friend, a person posting a picture of a concert hall because they\u2019ve finally come to the long-awaited concert of a singer, and a person posting a picture of a cat they adopted because of how adorable it is, and more.I looked at other people\u2019s daily lives whenever I could as if I\u2019d been possessed. But one time, I rushed into the intensive care unit because of an unknown seizure. The first thing I did when I came back to the hospital room after regaining my consciousness was checking my phone.Of course, no one had contacted me. I opened the social media app I had enjoyed using as I looked at my phone that had no notifications, and felt despondent. The outside world was so peaceful even as I had nearly died. People continued to post about their daily lives and posted pictures of how happy they were.I deleted the social media app, just like that. I could finally understand what the patient in the next bed had meant. It just brought my mood down. They were right.After that, I only read books. There were only special stories written, not everyday life stories, and these stories always came to an end.Now that I think about it, I think I liked the fact that there was an ending. The characters who met an end before I did. A world that came to an end. It\u2019s embarrassing, but I guess I liked it. The kinds of lives I could feel sorry for, despite the fact that I\u2019m stuck in a ward. Although I knew it was wrong, I wanted to read the stories of those who were more miserable and unlucky than I was. I wanted to think that my life was alright compared to theirs.In the meantime, my body grew weaker. My parents, who I had usually seen about once a week, were coming less frequently. I didn\u2019t mean to blame them. Since some time ago, they were beginning to look more fatigued than me, though I was the one that was hospitalized.So I also felt more comfortable when my parents didn\u2019t come. Because I was the one making them like that.\u2018I should just be grateful that they\u2019re paying the hospital bills.\u2019My condition was getting worse, but I tried extremely hard not to show it. I could already feel that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it past this year.\u00a0 One day, as the days went by, I picked up a book in the lounge on the floor of my hospital room.At first, I thought it was a book in the lounge, but it was very clean and there was no sign or writing indicating that it belonged to the hospital. I wondered if I should just leave it there, but ended up bringing it with me to the hospital room. I planned on asking a nurse to find its owner after I read it.Lying on the bed, I looked at the cover of the book. The title was <Iris>, and the number 2 was written after it.\u2018Is it the second book of the series?\u2019Somehow, I felt a bit disappointed. It would\u2019ve been nice if it was the first book. I wondered if I should look up the first book on my phone, but got lazy and just picked up the book again.\u2018Let\u2019s just read it from here.\u2019It wasn\u2019t a book I really wanted to read anyway. So I began reading the second volume of <Iris>. I could guess what the first book was about without even reading it. The second book began with Iris realizing that the power she had was holy power. At the same time, the powers of a Saintess named Yvelina, who was at the Grand Temple, disappeared.Then came the misdeeds of Yvelina. She became nervous after the disappearance of her holy powers, and began acting more self-indulgent. She refused to attend prayer meetings where showing her holy powers were required, and spent the night with men who only whispered sweet words to her.She was deceived by those who flattered her, driving away the priests, who told her what the right thing to do was, and gave out the temple\u2019s treasures and property under the name of the Saintess.So much of the story was about Yvelina that I thought the book should be renamed \u201cYvelina\u201d.In contrast to Yvelina\u2019s misdeeds, Iris helped people out with her powers. And by doing so, Iris met many people and became close to them.\u2018Let\u2019s see\u2026 commander of the army, crown prince, and king of the mages. As expected of the heroine.\u201dBefore getting taken away by Yvelina, Iris had already established friendships with the male leads. Because of this, they moved quickly when Iris was in danger. After reading for a long time, I had already come to the point where Yvelina was getting burnt at the stake.\u2026This was the last of the fake Saintess.This was how the 2nd volume ended. Since the greatly threatening villainess was gone, the next volume would be about Iris\u2019 happy story. The main topic would most likely be the nerve-wracking love story with the three male leads.\u2018There won\u2019t be any need to read the last bit.\u2019If I did, I\u2019ll just end up being jealous of the heroine of the story. I closed the curtains, turned off the lights, and got into bed.\u2018When people come to make rounds in the morning, I\u2019ll ask them to find the owner of the book.\u2019But I wasn\u2019t able to.I suddenly couldn\u2019t breathe, so I pressed the emergency bell. The nurse came running, and she called the medical staff. I heard someone yell at me to wake up, and shocks jolted through my body several times. But my consciousness was fading away more and more. I turned my head as the people\u2019s voices began fading away. I saw the book I read before falling asleep.That was the last thing I saw.That night, I died.Yes, I definitely died like that.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI let out a long sign and looked around the room.It was a very big room. It was so big that you would need to take tens of steps to go from one end to the other.It wasn\u2019t just big, either. The walls and ceilings were filled with detailed and beautiful paintings that seemed as if they could move any second. There were also fancy gold and red colored ornaments decorating the room all around.There was a fancy chandelier on the high ceiling, and curtains with fancy designs were on every window. In addition, the bed in one side of the room was the kind of huge, fancy bed you would only see in some foreign castle. It wasn\u2019t just the bed. The cabinet, table, chairs, porcelain, and more.In other words, it was an incredibly fancy room.After staring blankly at the room for a long time, I got up from my seat and opened the door. My jaw dropped as soon as I opened the door, and I had to blink a few times. In there were items that made the fancy things in the room I had just seen look shabby.A statue that seemed like it was made of pure gold, a glass studded with all sorts of jewels, a mountain of silk, and so on\u2026. As I stared at all the luxurious items, I unknowingly muttered.\u201cNo wonder you died like that since you lived like this\u2026.\u201dAfter muttering, I walked towards the statue that was placed on top of the cabinet. Then I looked at the mirror on the side. The statue made of pure-gold that was in front of me looked just like the blonde, blue-eyed woman reflected in the mirror. Then I saw the writing on the pedestal of the statue.Yvelina.\u201cYvelina\u2026.\u201dAfter muttering her name several times, I wrapped my hands around my head and clenched my hair.\u201cWhy did I have to become her, of all people\u2026!\u201d* * *One week ago, I opened my eyes. I thought this was the afterlife, because I remembered how my consciousness was fading at the hospital. That was before I heard the voices calling out to me.\u201cSaintess! Are you alright?!\u201dSaintess? Who\u2019re they talking to? When I opened my eyes, flustered, the people next to me called out to God and kneeled.\u201cOh, God! Thank you. What are you all doing? Go tell the other priests!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe people I was seeing for the first time started yelling and praying by themselves and things were becoming chaotic. I stared at the scene blankly. It was because it didn\u2019t feel real. It was to be expected, since they weren\u2019t the doctors and nurses I was used to seeing, but strangers wearing clothes I had never seen before.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how worried we were because you fainted for a week, Saintess Yvelina!\u201d\u2026Yvelina? Saintess?It\u2019s been a week since I\u2019ve woken up like that. Now I knew exactly what situation I was in.I had transmigrated into the book I read before going to bed. Into the body of a villainess that was destined to be burnt at the stake, at that.\u201cWhy did it have to be Yvelina\u2026.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI transmigrated after dying, but I was destined to die again soon. Within the week, I searched through my memories of the book I read and found out when this was. Right now was two years before my death. One year later, rumors of Iris\u2019 appearance will spread throughout the world, and a year after that, I will die.What should I do?This was all I thought all week. The first thought that came to mind was: \u2018I definitely can\u2019t die like that\u2019.Now I had to think about what was next.\u201c\u2026What should I do from now on?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a thought all living things most likely had, but I was a bit more desperate than others.\u2018I\u2019ve already died once.\u2019The memory of the moment of death remained so clear in my head that I couldn\u2019t even deny it. The doctors\u2019 footsteps, the machines\u2019 noises, and the people around them whispering about what to do. Then the view became dark. The doctors stopped talking as the machine beeped and lowered in volume. Then came the silence and the world of perfect nothingness.Just thinking about the fearful and depressing moment brought suffocation and tears.\u2018Also\u2026\u2019I jumped lightly. I moved my arms and legs around as well. My body was moving as I wished. This was an extremely unfamiliar sensation for me.All this time, I had to be careful every time I took a step, and I couldn\u2019t even imagine being able to run. But Yvelina\u2019s body, which I was in right now, was healthiness itself.This was very enjoyable and precious to me. What I\u2019d always wanted in the hospital was this. Effortlessly being able to go to the places I want with my own feet. I was so envious of how everyone was able to move around as if it were a given.I looked in the mirror again. I saw Yvelina, who had a beautiful face, bright blonde hair, and blue eyes.I knew I was an intruder who trespassed into this body. So I was definitely going to be kicked out one day.\u2018But I can\u2019t just use it as I please.\u2019Even the ease of breathing at every moment in this body was something I was grateful for. So although I know the body will die 2 years later, I can\u2019t use it as I please.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t be sure when Yvelina\u2019s consciousness would return, but I wanted to return her body to her safely if I could. It would be better if it was alive, too.\u2018Thankfully, I remember the contents of the book, and I have Yvelina\u2019s memories as well.\u2019It was a fortune among misfortunes that I had access to Yvelina\u2019s memories.So I didn\u2019t have to say things like \u2018Where is this? Who are you?\u2019 because I knew who the people next to me were, and how the temple worked.\u2018But there\u2019s another problem.\u2019The memories were way too clear. Thanks to that, I was able to know what Yvelina had been doing before I transmigrated into this body.\u201cWhat should I do\u2026\u201dI approached the mirror while mumbling and sighing. The clothes I was wearing right now were a Saintess\u2019 normal robes that gave off a very calm, pure, and holy image. There was fancy golden embroidery all over the pure white robe. I held the collar of the robe and pulled it down.The skin showing above the robe was smooth, fair skin without a single mark, but the same could not be said for the skin beneath the robe.It wasn\u2019t just red. There were blue bruises that looked like handprints all over the body. Not only that, but there were teeth marks all over the chest.I had never done anything for marks like these to be left on my body. But \u201cYvelina\u201d was different.\u201c\u2026What were you thinking?\u201dI murmured while looking in the mirror. After I had woken up, I dismissed everyone and confirmed what had happened to me. At that time, I had a splitting headache and Yvelina\u2019s memories popped into my mind. Before I had possessed her body, Yvelina had gone to bed. Not by herself, but with a few others. Yvelina and two men, to be exact.\u201cShe\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201dThe three of them did things beyond my moral understanding. I pressed my head as I recalled my memories. I\u2019d thought that she sure was amazing when reading the novel, but I never imagined I would see such vivid traces of her actions.Of course, she was free to live her life as she pleased, but Yvelina was a Saintess. In this novel, a Saintess didn\u2019t have to follow a suffocating rule that banned her from even meeting eye to eye with a man or anything, but she was someone who definitely should\u2019ve been living an exemplary life and getting respected by others. And of course, Yvelina\u2019s lifestyle was far from it.\u2018No wonder no one was on your side later on.\u2019When time passed and the real Saintess Iris appeared, there was no one by Yvelina\u2019s side. Even the men who had spent many nights with her. When I was reading, I had merely thought of it as the villainess\u2019 miserable words, but I felt despondent now that I\u2019ve become that Yvelina. When I looked into my memories, I saw that Yvelina didn\u2019t just end it at sleeping with them.\u2018Jewels, mansions, status\u2026\u2019I remembered all the things she gave to the men she slept with. She gave quite a lot to them.\u2018But not a single one was on her side, and just ran away.\u2019That wasn\u2019t all. From what I\u2019ve read, some of the people who had been in a relationship with Yvelina began clinging onto Iris after her appearance, claiming they had \u2018finally found their true love\u2019. Of course, these men were all immediately taken care of by the three male leads.I mumbled again while looking at the mirror.\u201c\u2026Your life is quite pitiful as well.\u2019I fixed my clothes and opened the door that was attached to the room that looked like a huge living room. Then I saw a study full of books. I say study, but all the shelves made it look like a library instead. I sat down at the desk, thinking \u2018so these are the things a Saintess can have\u2019.\u201cLet\u2019s summarize the situation for now.\u201dI quickly found a sheet of paper and a pen. I thought it would be good to summarize the current situation and what\u2019s happened up till now if I wanted to think about what I needed to do from now on.To be honest, I was planning on running away as soon as I figured out the situation. I was hoping I\u2019d be able to escape from the future I read in the book by doing so. But when I thought about it carefully, I realized that it wasn\u2019t a good idea.What would happen if I were to run away like this? Although I may be a pain in the foot right now, the current Saintess is Yvelina. The Grand Temple would be thrown into chaos.\u2018Even if I have her memories, it doesn\u2019t mean I know this world well.\u2019Yvelina\u2019s memories were limited to her life within the temple. She had come to the Grand Temple when she was very young, so she didn\u2019t know much about the outside world.Even if I ran away in this situation, would I be able to do it well? The temple\u2019s army would probably find me after a few days.\u2018If that happens\u2026\u2019I could imagine how the people would point fingers and talk about me. They would think that the Saintess, who had been acting out of control, has finally done it and is causing troubles outside of the temple as well. My reputation, which was already at rock bottom, would only fall even more.\u2018And it\u2019s not like Yvelina\u2019s misdeeds will disappear even if I run away now.\u2019I thought of all the evil deeds Yvelina committed in the novel.\u201cHaa\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but sigh. There were many things that Yvelina had done wrong. She was a Saintess who acted as she pleased, so she would send any priest who corrected her to a faraway temple in a dangerous area, and she used the property of the temple she stayed in as she pleased. On top of it, if the priests who served her made the smallest mistake, she raised her hand against them and didn\u2019t hesitate to insult them harshly. Even so, no one could say anything to her because she was the Saintess.\u2018At least she hasn\u2019t killed anyone yet.\u2019Right now was 2 years before Iris appeared.It was only when rumors of Iris began spreading that Yvelina began pointing out all sorts of faults in people and executing them.\u2018If that\u2019s the case\u2026 wouldn\u2019t I be able to fix what Yvelina has done if i work hard from now on?\u2019If her misdeeds won\u2019t disappear from me running away, maybe I should stay and try fixing her mistakes from the past, was what I thought.When Yvelina met a miserable ending in the book, no one stood up for her. But I felt like things could change in 2 years if I tried to console and turn back the people\u2019s hearts from now on.\u2018Also, Iris and the three male leads\u2026\u2019I wrote down the four of their names on the paper.Iris. Latban. Leon. Aslan.\u2018I think I can improve my relationship with these four if I work hard, too.\u2019In the book, Yvelina practically had a seizure anytime someone mentioned Iris\u2019 name. This was why she commanded for Iris to be killed immediately when Iris arrived at the temple. What would happen if Iris appeared and I greeted her happily?\u2018\u2026Wouldn\u2019t I be able to get through it safely then?\u2019In the book, Iris was someone who tried to understand Yvelina till the end. No, if you think about it, she was the only one on Yvelina\u2019s side. Since she was like that, if I worked hard, we would definitely have a good relationship.\u2018It\u2019s the same with the three male leads.\u2019It was the three of them that killed Yvelina in the book. It was because Yvelina had tried to murder Iris. But if I became friends with the three of them from now on and just gave away the Saintess position and everything to Iris and promised to never appear again, what would happen?\u2018There would be no problems then.\u2019The three of them acted for Iris. So if I showed them I didn\u2019t plan on harming her in any way and maintained a good relationship with her, the three of them wouldn\u2019t go out of their way to kill me either.\u2018The problem is\u2026\u2019I looked at the three male leads\u2019 names with worry.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018I already have terrible relationships with these three.\u2019Right now, that was the biggest problem.First, the commander of the temple\u2019s army, Latban. Out of the three, he hated Yvelina the most, as of right now. It was no wonder, since Latban was someone who had to serve the Saintess without question, according to the rules. But how could he have a good opinion on the Saintess when she was so corrupted instead of sacrificing for everyone and using God\u2019s power like she should?\u2018And it was just a while ago that their relationship had become broken beyond repair.\u2019I began recalling the incident where Yvelina and Latban had begun becoming estranged to each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a large-scale battle that even the commander, Latban, took part in, leaving only a minimal amount of people to guard the Grand Temple.The army traveled all over the continent, spreading the name of God. And after months of battling the monsters without casualties, a problem occurred as the army was returning to the Grand Temple. The sudden appearance of a huge monster caused damage towards the entire army. The monster was taken down thanks to commander Latban, but the vice commander suffered a great injury.The top priests who had been with them tried to treat him, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Commander Latban took him and rode back to the Grand Temple like a madman. Then he went to Yvelina\u2019s room and begged.\u201cPlease tell the Saintess! Hurry!\u201dThe priests were shocked to see Latban running towards them, carrying a bloody knight, and knocked on the Saintess\u2019 door. But Yvelina did not come out.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t she responding?!\u201dThere was no way she didn\u2019t hear the cry of help from outside her door. But Yvelina did not come out. Latban was losing his composure. Right then, a priestess came out of Yvelina\u2019s room. It was the priestess that served Yvelina. She hurried to Latban and asked.\u201cBy any chance\u2026 Did something happen between you and the Saintess before you left?\u201dLatban\u2019s expression scrunched up at these words.Before he left, Yvelina requested that he remained at the Grand Temple. It would\u2019ve been a different story if there was a valid reason for it, but Yvelina had requested this because she couldn\u2019t have lower quality guards by her side when she went out of the Grand Temple. And of course, Latban had told her that it would be difficult for him to remain.Then Yvelina broke out in anger.\u201cYou dare? You are obligated to serve the Saintess, and yet you\u2019re disobeying my words right now?!\u201dYvelina suddenly went silent after raging like a madwoman. Then she smiled so brightly that it was hard to believe she had been angry just moments ago. But those who knew Yvelina backed away at her smile. They knew Yvelina was the most dangerous when she smiled like this.\u201cYes, go ahead and go, commander Latban.\u201d\u201cThank you, Saintess.\u201dHe felt slightly uncomfortable that she had suddenly changed her mind when she had been saying she wouldn\u2019t allow him to go just moments ago, but Latban said his goodbyes and left her room. And while gazing at Latban, Yvelina spoke.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll make you regret this day one day.\u201dThe expressions of the priests nearby became dark. They knew Yvelina would do something terrible to commander Latban for what happened today.And now, everyone realized what was going on as they saw Latban waiting nervously for Yvelina to come out. The Saintess was taking her revenge for what happened on that day.\u201cPerhaps\u2026 The saintess is\u2026\u201dLatban made an incredulous expression. A Saintess was supposed to serve God and use her powers for the people. But she was refusing to treat the vice commander who was dying from a monster attack just because of the argument they had?He disliked Yvelina. Her outer appearance was fancy and beautiful, but her violent, poisonous, and cold personality was enough to overshadow her title as the Saintess. But because he was a part of the temple\u2019s army, he served the Saintess. No matter what kind of person Yvelina was, she was the Saintess chosen by God, and was someone he absolutely had to obey. This was why he had continued to lower his head towards her,but she was about to throw away someone\u2019s life because he had disobeyed an order that sounded more like a child\u2019s whining.The priestess hurriedly stopped Latban when she saw that he was grimacing.\u201cPlease, you mustn\u2019t argue with the Saintess now. You must beg for her forgiveness. Otherwise she will never come out!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven now, the vice commander\u2019s breathing was thinning out. At this rate, he would not last much longer. Latban gritted his teeth and spoke to the priestess next to him.\u201cPlease ask her what she wants.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cPlease\u2026 Ask her what I need to do for her to forgive my rudeness from last time and treat the vice commander.\u201dAt these words, the priestess hurried into the Saintess\u2019 room. She soon returned to Latban and hesitated.\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 uh\u2026\u201dLatban desperately asked the priestess, who was hesitating to speak.\u201cWhat did she say I had to do for her forgiveness?!\u201dAt these words, the priestess shut her eyes and spoke.\u201cS-She asked that you crawl to her bed on your knees. She said she couldn\u2019t have faith in your apology if you didn\u2019t\u2026\u201dThe people around them gasped at her words. It was ridiculous for her to ask him to crawl, but asking him to kneel in front of her was outrageous. Kneeling was an action one should only do in front of God. But he was being told to kneel in front of the Saintess and even crawl to her bed.As the commander of the army, it was something he could not do.Even the vice commander, who had barely been holding onto his consciousness, shaked his head at this.\u201cYou can\u2019t\u2026 Commander\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 Only for\u2026 God\u2026\u201dLatban did not hesitate any longer when the vice commander coughed up blood and breathed heavily after struggling to speak.\u201cPlease, open the door.\u201dAfter saying this to the priests, he got on his knees. Then he crawled towards the Saintess\u2019 bed, which he could see beyond the door, just like a dog. Yvelina was smiling while watching Latban on the bed.Next to Yvelina, who did not respond to Latban\u2019s calls, were beautiful men in disheveled attire. Yvelina\u2019s attire was the same. It was too easy to tell exactly what they had been doing here until a moment ago.Yvelina spoke kindly to Latban, who had crawled to the foot of the bed.\u201cAs expected of the commander of the temple\u2019s army. You\u2019re kneeling for a single subordinate of yours. I\u2019m tearing up at your dedication.\u201d\u201c\u2026Please save the vice commander.\u201d\u201cYes, of course. How could I ignore your sincerity when you crawled here like a dog?\u201dYvelina\u2019s laughter echoed in the silence, as if she could not contain her joy. That day, thankfully, the vice commander was able to live. But even with Yvelina\u2019s holy powers, it was impossible to treat the injuries completely. Although his life had been saved, he was no longer able to hold a sword, and returned to his hometown.After that day, Latban no longer seeked out Yvelina. Yvelina did not call for him either. The priests worried that the two with the highest positions in the temple had completely split off, but no one could fix their relationship.* * *\u201cWhy in the world did you do that\u2026\u201dI could only sigh after thinking about the novel\u2019s contents. Commander Latban was an exemplary holy knight. He was a knight who had no personal greed and only sought out noble honor. And yet she had mocked someone like that by telling him to break the rules of the temple and crawl on the floor in front of everyone.\u2018Can my relationship with him get better even if I try?\u2019My initial plan to \u2018improve relationships with the male leads\u2019 was beginning to seem ridiculous.My relationship with Latban, who\u2019s in the same temple, is like this, so how complicated must my relationship with Leon, who\u2019s at the imperial palace, and Aslan, who\u2019s at the tower of mages be?I continued to draw circles around the male leads\u2019 names with a blank stare as I thinked.Knock knock.I heard the knock on the door of the study, and soon I heard the voices of the priests standing outside.\u201cSaintess, priest Carus wishes to see you. What will you do?\u201dI hadn\u2019t fully gotten used to Yvelina\u2019s life yet. Therefore, I asked the priests guarding the door to reject anyone asking to see me so I could avoid interacting with people as much as possible. They accepted it without question, because Yvelina wasn\u2019t someone who enjoyed meeting people in the first place.Since then, they hadn\u2019t informed me of anyone\u2019s visit.\u2018Priest Carus, hm?\u2019It was a name I had seen several times in the book as well. He must be quite an important character, since he\u2019s visiting even when I\u2019ve declared that I won\u2019t be seeing anyone. I wondered if I should see him or tell him to leave, but ended up telling the priests to let him in for now.\u2018Since there are people I need to meet anyway, it\u2019ll be better to meet them one by one and slowly find out what kind of people they are.\u2019I put away the paper with the names of the male leads and Iris, and prepared to greet priest Carus.Soon, the door opened and a huge middle-aged man walked in.\u2018He\u2019s one of the senior priests.\u2019Judging from his robes, he was one of the few senior priests of the Grand Temple. The temple\u2019s structure begins with the Saintess at the top, and the pope, senior priests, middle class priests, lower class priests, and common priests. The army that commander Latban was in had a different hierarchy from the priests.Anyway, the man named Carus that just walked in now was someone with quite a high status. He walked into the study and bowed his head deeply, following the etiquette of the temple.\u201cGod\u2019s servant Carus, standing on the third stair, greets the Saintess.\u201d\u201cPlease raise your gaze.\u201dAlthough I knew how to act because of Yvelina\u2019s memories, I became nervous when meeting people like this. I expected someone to realize that something was off and yell \u2018She\u2019s the fake saintess!\u2019 any second.Much to my relief, priest Carus didn\u2019t say such things, but gazed at me after standing up straight.\u201cWhy did you ask to see me? I\u2019ve announced that I wouldn\u2019t be seeing anyone for the time being.\u201dWould this be similar enough Yvelina\u2019s usual way of speaking? I spoke nonchalantly, as if I was annoyed, with my voice full of arrogance.\u201cI know you must not be feeling well since you lost consciousness for a long time, but I came to hear your decision regarding the issue with the priest in charge for the prayer meeting\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c\u2026Prayer meeting?\u201dI desperately looked through my memories when he mentioned a prayer meeting.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dA few moments later, I pressed my forehead in frustration. There was an occasion that showed exactly how irresponsible of a Saintess Yvelina was after the fight with Latban. This was the prayer meeting. It was a huge event that was held once a year at the temple, and it was the only day where ordinary people could come into the central square of the Grand Temple. And during this event, the Saintess, Yvelina, must pray to God with everyone.That was what should have happened.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No matter how much I searched my memory, there were very few details about Senior Priest Carus. And even if Yvelina\u2019s memory remained, it was not complete. Fortunately, there wasn\u2019t much difficulty in pretending to be a saintess as it is now, but I don\u2019t remember even the smallest conversations with people.\u2018There are a lot of important things left to do.\u2019However, it was probably for two reasons that Yvelina has no memory of Carus. Either he\u2019s not worth remembering, or she doesn\u2019t want to remember him. And as I look at Senior Priest Carus now, it may be both.\u2018How can a man like this be a High Priest?\u2019She believes in what people call \u2018first impression.\u2019\u00a0 No matter how beautiful a person is, he or she can be instinctively perceived as repugnant; and even if he or she is not beautiful, he or she can be attractive.Growing up, I spent most of my life in the hospital.\u00a0 If you are in the cheapest 12-person hospital ward covered by insurance, you will encounter a variety of people. Observing those people was a big part of my daily routine as I don\u2019t do anything all day long. Thanks to this, I now have a high probability of guessing what kind of person someone is only with my first impression.If I trust my instincts, this Priest Carus is not a good person to get close to.\u00a0 It is that kind of feeling.\u201cSaintess?\u201dAs I stared at him for a long time, Carus drew closer. Then he lowered his voice to the fullest and asked.\u201c\u2026Are you still agonizing about the favor that I asked for?\u201dWhat on earth did Carus ask for? First, I had to know what it was. I deliberately asked again one more time, as if it were a very troublesome matter.\u201cWell, I don\u2019t remember what you asked me to do.\u201dWhen I made an expression of not knowing what he\u2019s talking about, Priest Carus licked his lips in frustration thinking I\u2019m purposely pretending to be ignorant. After so many hesitations, he looked around and said again.\u201cI beseech your favor last time. I asked you to assign me to lead the upcoming prayer meeting on behalf of the fallen High Priest Dailan.\u201dSo that\u2019s what you asked me to do. Looking back on Yvelina\u2019s memory, Dailan, who has a high position on the Great Temple, was already an old man and was now having a hard time doing his job properly. That\u2019s why there seems to be a power struggle over the position of the said High Priest in the temple.\u2018Anyway, it\u2019s the Saintess\u2019 duty to appoint a high priest\u2026.\u2019So, even if they didn\u2019t like Yvelina\u2019s behavior, the senior priests couldn\u2019t say anything and continued to curry favor with her. Thanks to that, Yvelina seemed to have been even more unstoppable with her audacious deeds.First of all, I will never put this person as a substitute for the position of that high priest. Therefore, I spoke to Priest Carus in a firm voice.\u201cWell, I\u2019m still not sure if you can handle the position. So go back for now\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you do this, aren\u2019t you breaking your promise, Saintess?\u201dCarus went even further before I could even finish speaking. His face had turned scarlet with anger and frustration. And before I could even say anything, he opened his mouth first.\u201cPerhaps, did you not like the offering that I gave you?\u201d\u201c\u2026Offerings?\u201dI doubted my ears for a moment. What kind of offerings?\u201cThat\u2019s right. I really worked hard to pick and choose them. I made sure that there were no flaws with their faces and body, and I also purposely chose the submissive ones thinking that they might become impudent to the Saintess. Perhaps, are those two not enough? Then I\u2019ll increase the number next time. If there\u2019s anything particular you want\u2026.\u201d\u201cStop.\u201dI raised my hand to stop Carus from speaking. From his words, I already knew what Yvelina had received from him. The two men sitting next to her bed disheveled when she had a dispute with Commander Latban. And the men who left the red marks under her clothes.\u00bb\u00bb\u22b6\u22b6\u22b6\u22b6\u22b6\u271e\u22b7\u22b7\u22b7\u22b7\u22b7\u00ab\u00ab\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI buried myself deep on the sofa after Carus left, and gave an order not to let anyone in today.\u2018Now isn\u2019t the time to worry about Iris and the male leads.\u2019I am pressed with rather more pressing situations. The prayer meeting and Yvelina\u2019s personal affairs.I lifted my robe and looked at Yvelina\u2019s body. There are still reddish marks left. Such marks on the skin will disappear immediately if you use your Holy Power.\u00a0 But I couldn\u2019t.\u2018A Holy Power wielder can\u2019t heal oneself.\u2019That was the setback with having holy power. It may be God\u2019s will to give them strength and use holy power to heal others, but in return, they cannot heal themselves.\u2018First, I should never let men in.\u2019I also told Carus to stop letting some unknown man inside the Temple for I won\u2019t need them anymore. Then he just said, \u2018I\u2019ll look for better people.\u2019 as if misunderstanding what I meant. He seemed to think that I was just being grumpy because I wasn\u2019t satisfied with the men he brought before.Then he quickly stepped back, asking me to reconsider the High Priest substitute position.\u2018I\u2019m going to have to clean up the surroundings quickly but\u2026 for now, the issue with the prayer meeting comes first.\u2019In the novel, Yvelina\u2019s reputation has plummeted down starting from the prayer meeting. So, first of all, the prayer meeting had to be held safely.\u00bb\u00bb\u22b6\u22b6\u22b6\u22b6\u22b6\u271e\u22b7\u22b7\u22b7\u22b7\u22b7\u00ab\u00abThe preparation wasn\u2019t difficult. This is because everyone in the temple is desperately helping. I searched through all of Yvelina\u2019s memories and recalled the people involved in the information about the prayer meeting. As soon as I said I wanted to go outside and check how the prayer meeting preparation was going, the priests made an incredible expression on their faces. Then they ran off straight to somewhere.A long time later, when they came back, there were many people behind them.First of all, what surprised me the most was that the prayer meeting was only two weeks away. The second surprise was the fact that there\u2019s not much time left for the once-a-year event, in which Yvelina never participated in the preparation.When I asked them to prepare for the prayer meeting, the believers seemed to be ready to finish everything quickly before I could pick on a single thing again.Stacks of papers were piled on the desk with the prayer meeting schedule. After listening to the explanation for a long time, the priests in charge of the robes to be worn at the prayer meeting were waiting for me, for the second time.\u201c\u2026Do I have to wear it again?\u201dWhen I got tired of wearing my tenth robe and asked, the priests suddenly wore an expression as if asking why I was asking such an obvious question. After counting all of them, I had a total of fifteen sets of robes to change to for two days. They were all almost the same robes, but they have to be worn according to the sequence of the prayer meeting such as speaking, listening, and reaching out to people.After a long inspection of them, another group of priests came up and said,\u201cSaintess, if you don\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t you check the movements of the prayer meeting once? There\u2019s nothing much different from last year, but for the first time attending priests\u2026.\u201dThe voices of the priests who said so were getting smaller and smaller. It\u2019s natural. The former Yvelina went into the room immediately after the priests made a request like this, saying, \u2018Stop annoying me.\u2019 The expressions on the priests\u2019 faces were full of worries about what to do if I did the same.\u201cI understand. Lead the way.\u201dAs a matter of fact, I was waiting excitedly about this task. After opening my eyes from Yvelina\u2019s body, I continued to only spend time in her room. This is because I\u2019m afraid of not knowing what to do if people feel strange because of a mistake I might make when I go out.However, if priests surrounded me for the preparation of the prayer meeting like this, they will guide me on their own and no one will be able to easily approach me.Soon I left my room with the priests.Even though I was just going to look around inside the Great Temple, there were dozens of people who accompanied me. When the priests walking in the front announced that the Saintess was passing by, instead of going their separate ways, the people in the temple hurriedly stepped aside and bowed deeply.It was already burdensome even when I was just staying in the room, but now that I came out, I could clearly feel the power held by the Saintess\u2019 position.\u201cThe first thing to do is to check the traffic in Central Square.\u201d\u00a0 The leading priest said, guiding me.Central Square.The words made me flinch. The Central Plaza is inside the Great Temple. It was the place where Yvelina was burned at the stake in the novel. As I approached the terrace at the end of the white marble corridor, I got a glimpse of the huge plaza.\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euI tried to hold myself up, but without realizing it, I let out an exclamation. The square under the terrace was as wide as a horse racing arena, and could probably fit a small city within it.\u2018It is said that this huge place was built only for the Saintess\u2026.\u2019The moment I felt dizzy by the enormous power that a saintess holds more than I thought,\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dMy eyes met with someone standing from the square.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It wasn\u2019t until a few seconds passed before I could clearly look at his face. Shortly cut black hair, and underneath I saw a slightly darker skin that was nicely tanned by the sun. I could see the straight, thick eyebrows, the sharp eyes underneath, and the tightly closed lips under the coolly extended nose.He was a man who felt like a statue made of iron. The man was looking at me as I was staring at him. A short period passed with our eyes entangled. And it was the man who turned his head first.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dI felt an unknown regret over such a man\u2019s behavior. As soon as a sigh came out, I could see the priests next to me panicking.\u201cS-Saintess. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s not intentional.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It seemed that Commander Latban just left without knowing you were here because of the distance.\u201d\u201c\u2026Latban?\u201dThe moment I muttered the name that the priest mentioned, I realized that the man I saw was the Commander of the Knights, Latban, whom I had vaguely seen in Yvelina\u2019s memory.\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019No wonder, he somehow has the strongest impression compared to all the persons I\u2019ve met so far. He was one of the main characters of this world. Perhaps because I didn\u2019t prepare my mind and stared directly at him, my heart thumped. As I stayed still without saying anything, the priests became more restless and did not know what to do.I understand why they are like that.Clearly, Commander Latban was a person who strictly followed the rules of the temple. Even in the novel, there was a scene where Iris, the female protagonist, was teasing him; asking if he was a machine and not a person because he always abides by the rules like a sword. A person who would rather end his own life rather than violate the rules of the temple. Commander Latban was such a person.\u2018And he broke the rules in front of everyone.\u2019The absolute ruler in the Great Temple is the Saintess.\u00a0 So naturally, as soon as Latban saw Yvelina, he had to come up to her, bow down and formally greet her. However, he turned his back and ignored the Saintess even though everyone was looking at him.\u201cI-Impudent\u2026!\u201dOne of the priests raised his voice as if he couldn\u2019t believe it as he watched Latban walking away. Then, the voices of the priests around him also grew louder. Among them, the priest who was guiding me spoke with a particularly contemplative expression.\u201cHow could Commander Latban ignore the Saintess? It\u2019s clear that he did it unintentionally, so please don\u2019t be upset.\u201dFrom the look of the priest, he seemed worried that the Saintess who had barely been dragged out of her room, would return in anger due to the leader of the Knight\u2019s, Latban\u2019s actions.\u2018If it\u2019s not like that, then they\u2019re afraid of me shouting to immediately have Commander Latban brought in front of me.\u2019Yvelina would have done so right away. But of course, I don\u2019t intend to do that. Considering his sentiments that he crawled on his stomach for his subordinate\u2019s life, it was fortunate that he walked out right away and didn\u2019t stab her with his sword.\u2018I\u2019m glad he just left.\u2019On the contrary, I would have felt uncomfortable if he came to greet me. As I was looking at the path where Commander Latban disappeared, someone approached and said,\u201cHow can you just stand by such rudeness? How about taking this opportunity to change the Knight\u2019s Commander and hold him accountable?\u201dThen another priest said as if waiting for the right time to interject.\u201cThat\u2019s right. As everyone knows, the Knights of the Temple have long been acting no different from the soldiers owned personally by Commander Latban. Before they become more confused about who they should serve, I think it\u2019s right to appoint a new leader as soon as possible.\u201dAt first, their words seemed to rebuke the leader for his rudeness, and earnestly wished for his punishment. But I had to try not to laugh in vain at their subsequent remarks.\u201cThere are many talented people in the Knights of the Temple apart from Commander Latban. As soon as the Saintess tells me, I\u2019ll make a list right away.\u201d\u201cI have someone to recommend. If you want to see him for yourself, I\u2019ll send him a message right away.\u201dEveryone wants to make a new Knight\u2019s Leader who has a connection with them. I put their faces and names in my head. I think it\u2019s these people who should be removed from the temple, not Commander Latban.\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7\u25c6\u25c7It took a long time to check the preparations for the prayer meeting and finally return to my room. Although my body was tired, I was quite excited.\u00a0 I was able to feel the scale of the Great Temple, and I realized that this place is a different world by looking at the scenery that caught my eyes from time to time.I was thrilled to see the sunset sky, the huge birds flying in the orange and purple sky, and the countless people moving in clothes I\u2019ve never seen before. I thought it would be like a stage play because I knew of this place as the world in the book.\u2018Everyone\u2019s alive.\u2019When I was lying on the hospital bed, I often had to watch TV with other people in the next bed. In the afternoon, after lunch, no one watched TV although it was turned on. This is because boring news or documentaries from faraway countries are flowing out.But I found it the most enjoyable. When I was watching on my cell phone secretly under the blankets at night, I always watched videos of traveling to distant countries. One day, I imagined traveling there, too.Are the things I wished for during those times being fulfilled now?It was a completely different feeling, having a hard time going around the hospital with a sick body, and having a hard time walking around every corner of the Great Temple on my own feet today.As soon as I ate and washed, I fell asleep as I felt the pleasant fatigue for the first time.How much time has passed? When I opened my eyes, I got out of bed and approached the window. The cool night\u2019s air blew pleasantly from the open window.\u2018I want to walk more.\u2019I wanted to walk more even though I walked all day. In case Yvelina\u2019s consciousness comes back right this moment. In case I disappear. I always feel anxious thinking that I might not feel the sensation of walking with a healthy body again.I wanted to walk along the Great Temple\u2019s back garden that I saw out the window a while ago. Alone in a quiet moonlit place. I wore my coat and was about to head for the door, then I stopped.\u2018What shall I do?\u2019If I open the door as it is and go out, it was obvious that the priests who were waiting for my orders outside all day would immediately stick to me everywhere I go.\u2018I\u2019m sure in the novel\u2026.\u2019There was a scene where Yvelina avoided the eyes of people and formed a relationship with men inside the temple. If so, then there was a way to leave this place alone. I quickly looked at Yvelina\u2019s memory.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dFortunately, I got to know the method quickly. The problem is that I saw things I didn\u2019t want to see together with the rest of the memories.\u00a0 All the memories that came to mind were embarrassing things that made me immediately turn my eyes away.\u00a0 Every scene in my memory was in different places, and with different faces of different men.\u00a0 It seems that Yvelina lived a much more promiscuous life than what was written in the book.Just looking at it briefly reminds me of several people, and I\u2019m afraid to imagine how many men will come out if I trace my memory one by one.\u2018And somehow I feel sorry.\u2019However Yvelina may have lived, it was still her private life. No matter how much I came into Yvelina\u2019s body, I still feel sorry for seeing other people\u2019s bare memories.\u00a0 It feels like reading someone else\u2019s diary without permission.\u2018Though I don\u2019t have any choice but to watch it.\u2019Yvelina\u2019s memory is the only thing I can trust in this situation. When the day comes that the original owner of this body returns, I must apologize for looking at her memories at will, no matter how ridiculous it may seem.Thinking so, I stepped into the inner room.This room is called the Saintess\u2019 room but it was so big it could be compared to a palace. This is because countless rooms and corridors are continuously connected. I walked in the corridor under the light made by my holy power and continued walking further inward. Then I opened the door of the room at the end of the corridor.Creak.As I entered the room with a creaking sound, there appeared a neatly arranged small room. At first glance, it looks like a room to take a rest. A large mirror was attached to the wall with several paintings, and a large wardrobe was placed in the corner.The passage is connected to the back of the painting, the back of the mirror, and the back of the closet. Even though I don\u2019t know who made this passage and for what purpose, Yvelina walked around the Great Temple, avoiding people\u2019s eyes, through these passages.\u2018Is there no passage that leads outside the temple?\u2019I searched my memory just in case, but there seemed to be no such thing.\u00a0 First, I approached the mirror. Seeing the reflection in the mirror made me feel strange.\u00a0 I am the one who moves and thinks, but the body belongs to Yvelina, not mine.\u00a0 My actions will be seen by people as Yvelina\u2019s actions.That fact was neither sorrowful nor sad.Why did I come to the world in the book? And why does it have to be with Yvelina\u2019s body?\u00a0 Looking at the image in the mirror for a while, I felt goosebumps.\u2018For now\u2026 The passage connected to the mirror was directly connected to the back garden.\u2019When I pushed the mirror, I saw a small door that I could enter if I bent my back.\u00a0 No, I think it\u2019s a little ambiguous to call it a door.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t see the handle anywhere on the door that looked as if it had only been drawn gold on the wall.\u00a0 Others will never be able to open this door.\u00a0 Though I\u2019m also not sure if I could\u2026.I put my hand on the door. Then the entire door was painted with complicated blue patterns and disappeared in an instant. And with the light disappearing, the door disappeared.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dIt was like the magic that I saw in cartoons and movies. It was the first time I saw it with my own eyes, and it was amazing that I\u2019m the one who used that power.\u2018From the book, it is said that it only responds to the holy power of the Saintess.\u2019I thought it was strange for a moment.\u2018\u2026Wasn\u2019t Yvelina a fake saintess?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But why does this door, which response only to the holy power of the Saintess, opened in response to Yvelina\u2019s holy power?\u2018Come to think of it\u2026 since when did her holy power completely disappear?\u2019Rethinking the contents of the book, Yvelina was called a fake saintess because her holy power was claimed to have completely disappeared, but her holy power was never denied.\u2018So is she a real Saintess at the moment?\u2019I stood in front of the aisle and looked at the hand that had reached the door a little while ago. The blue light of the holy power that had hovered for a while was completely gone.The passage behind the mirror had no light. I braved to walk in this passage because I\u2019ve seen it in Yvelina\u2019s memory many times. But without that memory, I would never have walked inside.\u2018The road behind the mirror leads to the back garden.\u00a0 The road behind the painting leads to the central square.\u00a0 And the road behind the closet leads to the entrance of the Great Temple.\u2019In case I might need to use different paths than what I used today, I have memorized the information I saw in Yvelina\u2019s memory. It was not long before I came across a wall. Just like when I touched the wall from the room before, I placed my hand on this wall and the blue light turned again and the darkly blocked wall disappeared in an instant. A thick tree then appeared in front of my eyes.When I walked out of the passage and looked back, I saw that the entrance was made in the corner of the wall of the back garden. Shortly after I came out, it changed into the shape of the wall again. Again this time, I raised my hand to see if my power was working properly.\u00a0 The blue light returned, the walls disappeared, and I saw the passage once more.\u00a0 I stepped back and after a while, the wall went back to its original form.After confirming that there was no problem with how to get back to the room, I slowly walked into the garden.I felt more comfortable rather than scared.\u00a0 Even if I\u2019m alone in the room at night, the cries of birds and the sounds of grass bugs that rang out were comforting.\u00a0 It has been a long time since I felt relaxed.\u00a0 I always felt like I was being watched because there were always people waiting for me outside.There were so many eyes watching me all day. It was amazing and nice at first, but I soon got tired.When I was in the hospital, I was no different from the furniture there.\u00a0 If you\u2019re there all the time, it\u2019s natural that there will come a time that nobody would care so much about your existence.\u00a0 However, if you\u2019re not in your proper place, they will wonder where you went, even just for a short time.After getting used to such a situation, I was really happy when people reacted to me when I just slowed down a little or when they showed a little interest in me.As I breathed in the night air filled with the smell of trees, I felt a little at ease.\u00a0 Like that, I walked the desolate garden path.\u00a0 As time went by, my chaotic mind seemed to calm down.As I trudged along the back garden while enjoying the quiet scenery of the night, my soles began to hurt a little again. After checking the surroundings, I lay down on the nearby bench. A cool breeze brushed past my face. The sky I looked up was full of stars, which seemed to fall anytime. I burst into a smile.\u201cThere are two moons.\u201dI can\u2019t believe I can see with my own eyes the world that those many novels I have read on the hospital bed were written as fiction, and were said to be far from reality. I looked at the moon and the stars in the sky for a long time as I lay down and raised my legs. Because the clothes I was wearing were pajamas, the cloth flowed down and the long thin white legs were revealed under the moonlight.I felt some pain in my legs because I walked all day and walked again now.\u2018I tried to walk more because the pain was funny.\u2019I thought I\u2019d have to enjoy this pain until tonight. I can\u2019t walk around like this every day, no matter how fun and exciting it is. Besides, it\u2019s not my body, so I can\u2019t work it out as I want.I raised my body and slowly pressed my slightly swollen leg. Then the moment I looked at the inside of my thigh, I changed my posture in confusion and sat down.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dA strange mark dwells on the inside of the thigh.\u00a0 A blue mark the size of a thumb.\u00a0 It was too big and clear to be considered bitten by an insect.\u00a0 I wondered if it was one of those remaining marks left on Yvelina after having relationships with men, but it was a completely different form from the other marks left in her body.\u2018Others aren\u2019t this round.\u2019A mark made by someone deliberately pressing down on a round object.\u00a0 A single mark was strange enough, but there were three consecutive ones. It was clear that the marks were intentionally made.I searched Yvelina\u2019s memories for some answers, but nothing came to mind.\u00a0 Somehow, an unpleasant feeling passed through my neck.\u00a0 Does this mean that you don\u2019t have to remember it or do you not want to?\u2018I want to erase it.\u2019Thinking so, I pressed the mark with my hand. Of course, it couldn\u2019t disappear. Somehow I wasn\u2019t happy with what was left in front of me, so I gave it a little more strength and rubbed the marks. At that moment, a blue light hung on my fingertips.\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dAs soon as I raised my hand, amazed by the sudden light, the light disappeared immediately.\u2018Holy Power.\u2019It seems that holy power was something that could be used more easily than I thought.\u2018Come to think of it, I haven\u2019t tried to use my holy powers yet.\u2019After entering this body, I never had the chance to use my holy powers.\u00a0 It is natural for there isn\u2019t a great battle against the demons at the moment, and the story events are still not in progress. The only time I saw my holy power work properly was when I opened and closed the passage to get here.\u2018Why didn\u2019t I think about using it?\u2019According to the contents of the book, after a year of Iris\u2019 awakening, Yvelina\u2019s holy power will decrease.\u00a0 Later she will no longer be able to use her power after Iris comes to the Great Temple.\u2018I should have used this first.\u2019Thinking so, the moment I searched through Yvelina\u2019s memories, I bit my lips. I couldn\u2019t see anything just like when I traced the origin of the mark on my thigh a little while ago. No, even though I couldn\u2019t remember anything about them all the same, I could somehow feel some dense darkness intertwined with it. It\u2019s as if everything regarding holy power was purposely removed.\u2018Why is it?\u2019Yvelina was a person who shouted that she was a saint until the moment she died. Why didn\u2019t she think about her holy power at all?\u2018Somehow\u2026 there\u2019s a lot of strange things.\u2019As for this mark, and as for the holy power.\u00a0 Of course, the contents of the book were only filled with the story of the main character, Iris.\u00a0 Most of the story about Yvelina was only about her evil deeds.\u00a0 So there was no such thing mentioned about these.If I keep trying to think about it, I wonder if something will eventually come to mind.\u00a0 It was when I was thinking so.\u201cSaintess, you\u2019re here!\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7!\u201dSuddenly, I heard a strange man\u2019s voice. As I looked at the place where the sound was heard, a man dressed as a common priest stood there.\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry for the late introduction. I am here to serve the Saintess under the orders of Father Carus.\u201dThe man said so and then knelt in front of me.\u00a0 I could already tell who he was just by the mention of the name of Carus. It seemed that Carus had misunderstood my words to not bring unknown men inside the temple anymore, and went out and looked for new men again. The man continued to say,\u201cWhen I saw the lights in the room were turned off, I was thinking of going back, but I remembered what I heard from the man who once served you. He said you enjoy doing it in the back garden. I took a little risk from those words and sneaked in like this\u2026 I can\u2019t believe that the Saintess was here. God must\u2019ve guided me to where the Saintess is.\u201dI looked at the man who was talking excitedly.\u00a0 As expected, I noticed that his hair was too long for a priest.\u00a0 And I could see the clothes that ordinary people wear through the uniforms of the priests.\u00a0 In fact, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly that, his appearance was too groomed to be called a priest.\u00a0 Pressing my sore head, I shook my hand at him.\u201cPlease return.\u201d\u201c\u2026What does the Saintess mean?\u201d\u201cJust as I said.\u00a0 Return from where you came from.\u00a0 And tell Carus not to send any more people.\u201dAt my words, the man panicked and shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t do that.\u201dBefore long, the man suddenly came close and grabbed my ankle.\u201cWhat are you\u2026?!\u201d\u201cI can satisfy you much more than those who came last time. Please, don\u2019t throw me out like this.\u201dThe man said so, then swept my leg up with his hand.\u00a0 In an instant, the sensation of the man stroking the inside of my thigh was so creepy that I tried to kick the man.\u201cI heard the story.\u00a0 There were also those men who can\u2019t make you satisfied enough.\u00a0 I also heard that many people came back without receiving the Saintess\u2019 favor.\u00a0 But I\u2019m different from those kids.\u201dThe man who said so grabbed my knees on the bench and spread it aside.\u00a0 Then, before I could even say anything, he put his body between my legs.\u00a0 Then he looked at me and said.\u201cWe can\u2019t just blow away the hard-won opportunity from Priest Carus. I will make sure to satisfy the Saintess, and I will also be blessed with the grace of the Saintess like everyone else.\u201dThe man, after saying so, licked his lips.\u00a0 Instinctively, a feeling of disgust flowed through my body.\u00a0 Now is not the time to think about anything else.\u00a0 I immediately reached out and shouted, grabbing the man\u2019s hair as he was about to approach.\u201cGet lost! Is someone there? Help\u2026 eupp!\u201dWhen I screamed, the man covered my mouth with a perplexed expression on his face.\u201cWhy?\u00a0 Why are you doing this?\u00a0 If you didn\u2019t want it, you could have punished me with your holy power.\u00a0 Doesn\u2019t the fact that you haven\u2019t done anything so far means that the Saintess also wants me?\u201d\u2018I still don\u2019t know how to use that power yet!\u2019I made a sound again with my mouth closed under the man\u2019s hand.\u00a0 At the same time, I wielded my hands and feet desperately and hit the man\u2019s body.\u00a0 It was then.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe man who was on top of me suddenly groaned and released the hand that was covering my mouth.\u00a0 At the same time, his body floated into the air and flew far away, hitting a tree from the back garden.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThud!How strongly did he fly away?\u00a0 The branch that hit the man broke with a loud noise, and the man also fell to the ground and rolled.\u00a0 Who just threw this guy away?\u00a0 As soon as I turned my head while thinking so, I stopped breathing.The black eyes I saw during the day were looking straight at me.\u201c\u2026Latban?\u201dOne of the male protagonists in this world.

I could see a wide shoulder that looked like a huge wall with a tall height that I had to look up at.\u00a0 He was wearing the white temple knight\u2019s robes, but it was clear at a glance that there were extremely hardened muscles under the clothes.\u00a0 At the same time, I saw thick forearms and big hands.\u00a0 It was so big that I thought he could crush my head with just one hand if he wills himself to.My gaze, which had been staring at him for a long time, turned back to his face.\u00a0 Only then that I could know. The fact that Latban\u2019s eyes that were on me are full of deep contempt.\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dA raw, strong emotion that he doesn\u2019t even try to hide.\u00a0 At his gaze, I leaned back without even knowing.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t step back anymore because the bench was blocking my back.He was also looking at me as I looked at him.\u00a0 His expression stiffened and then he turned his head.\u00a0 His hurried attitude was as if he had seen something he shouldn\u2019t have seen.\u2018Oh, my God.\u2019I could see why Latban made such an expression without even asking.\u00a0 Even before the man came, the hem of my pajama, which had been fully raised as I looked at the marks on my legs, was further crumpled due to the man\u2019s attack.\u00a0 As a result, my legs were completely exposed under the moonlight, and the traces left on them were clearly exposed.As I hurriedly lowered my skirt, Latban, who turned his head, opened his mouth.\u201cI wish I didn\u2019t see it.\u201dThat was what Latban said to me for the first time.\u00a0 The awfully low voice that came through the night air revealed the contempt that was contained in the gaze of his eyes.He wished he didn\u2019t see it?\u00a0 Does it mean that he doesn\u2019t want to see me?\u00a0 Or that I should not be seen by other people?\u00a0 In fact, it didn\u2019t matter either way.As soon as I heard his voice, I realized how complacent and arrogant my idea of creating a good relationship with the male protagonists was.In the book, Latban is a noble knight who serves God without any disruption and values honor.\u00a0 And Yvelina mocked him by making a dog out of him in front of everyone.\u00a0 Perhaps for Latban, his whole life was ridiculed.\u00a0 But if I try to do my best from now on, would I be able to erase it?Latban will never forgive Yvelina.Then the man who fell down after hitting the tree groaned.\u00a0 I got up from my seat, distracted by the sound.\u00a0 Then I bowed my head towards the Latban.\u201cThank you for helping me.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dWhatever it was, I had to say what I had to say.\u00a0 Of course, no answer came back from him.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t even expect it.\u00a0 He would definitely not want to exchange more words with me.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Commander Latban, something bad\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m not interrupting instead.\u201dHe cut me off and said in a cold voice.\u201cNext time, please just use your holy power.\u00a0 Some people might think that you\u2019ve forgotten how to use your powers.\u201dI was choked by his words.I remembered the contents of the book.\u00a0 The moment they noticed that Yvelina\u2019s holy power had disappeared, without any hesitation, Latban pointed his sword at her.\u00a0 And before burning to death, the long sword that struck on Yvelina\u2019s back was Latban\u2019s.With that arm, with that hand.\u00a0 This man will kill me.Someday, and in the days to come, my future has become bleak.<figure>\u201cCommander!\u201dThe Knights of the Temple shouted in surprise at the sight of Latban entering the knights\u2019 building.\u00a0 Without knowing what kind of wind suddenly blew, Latban went out and volunteered to be the evening guard.\u00a0 Then on his way back, he was dragging someone no one knew where he had picked up.At first, everyone shouted in surprise when they saw the man in the priest\u2019s uniform, but soon they realized that the man Latban had dragged was not a priest.\u00a0 At that moment, the knights\u2019 bodies stiffened with tension.\u00a0 A person who is not a priest entered the temple pretending to be a priest.\u00a0 And he was caught by Latban.\u00a0 Stiff tension that felt like a sword would be drawn at once immediately filled the knight\u2019s building.Latban took a look at captives and the knights before he spoke briefly.\u201cWhen he wakes up in the morning, send him outside.\u201d\u201cYes? But\u2026.\u201dIt is a felony to impersonate a priest and enter the temple.\u00a0 They had to arrest him immediately, check his identity, and thoroughly investigate for what purpose and how he entered the temple.\u00a0 But they can\u2019t believe he\u2019ll just be thrown away in the morning.At that time, one of the knights looked at the man who had fallen and murmured as if he knew something.\u201cHe has an excessively good-looking face.\u201dThe faces of the knights hardened at those words.\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t a great secret from the Knights that the Saintess enjoys playing by attracting men from the street every night. Perhaps this man was one of those men.\u00a0 Upon realizing that, the knights immediately knew why Latban had ordered them to just let the man go.Anyway, if one of the Senior Priests dedicated this man to the Saintess, there was nothing that would come out of it.\u00a0 Rather, it was clear that they would come to the Knights to put unnecessary pressure on them so that what they did wouldn\u2019t be found out.One of the knights told Latban,\u201cDon\u2019t you think we should interrogate him?\u201dThen Latban asked back,\u201cAnd why should we do that?\u201dEveryone here knows the identity of this man, so he asked the knight to explain why they had to do such a useless thing.Then the knight answered, scratching his head.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure this guy will tell you everything in less than ten minutes.\u00a0 Who is he, the name of the priest who helped him, and what for what purpose.\u00a0 So, after the interrogation is over, let\u2019s tie him to the front of the temple with the record, and everyone passing by will know what happened last night.\u201dThe face of the knight who said so was full of ridicule.\u00a0 It was a mockery on the Saintess who would have attracted this man.\u201c\u2026So what do we get if we do that?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI asked, what could we get if we do that?\u00a0 Once we look it up, this man probably has a temporary pass to the Great Temple.\u00a0 They would just say that the priest\u2019s uniform was worn for a while due to some nonsense and unavoidable circumstances.\u00a0 Then the priests who let this man in will desperately cover it.\u00a0 Saying that there was nothing lost, nor no one was hurt\u2026.\u201dWhen Latban paused for a moment, the knights looked at him as if they were wondering why.\u201c\u2026Anyway, after that, they will just ask for a very light punishment.\u00a0 Then what will be left?\u00a0 Isn\u2019t it ridicule towards the Temple?\u201dAt Latban\u2019s words, the knight who told him to catch the man and tie him up outside replied with a stiff face.\u201c\u2026At least there\u2019ll be a reason to laugh.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cOnce the people realized what that woman was doing\u2026.\u201d\u201cSidel.\u201dAt Latban\u2019s cold voice, the knight called Sidel shut his mouth.\u201cWatch your mouth.\u00a0 When you entered the Knights of the Temple, you swore an oath.\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dThe words distorted Sidel\u2019s face.\u00a0 Then Latban called him one more time.\u201cSidel.\u201dIt was a voice prompting him to answer quickly.\u201c\u2026I understand.\u00a0 I will be more careful about what I say and do to the Saintess.\u201dSidel said so as he bowed his head to Latban and immediately went out.\u00a0 The other knights standing next to them shook their heads while looking at the door where Sidel went out.\u201cCommander, please understand.\u00a0 Sidel is just\u2026.\u201dSidel was a knight who admired Latban more than anyone else in the Knights of the Temple.\u00a0 And the knights will always jokingly say that Sidel came here just to serve Latban.\u00a0 Therefore, the moment Sidel heard the news that Latban had crawled like a dog in front of the Saintess, he seemed to want to kill the Saintess immediately.But now, when the one who was insulted told Sidel himself to keep his courtesy toward the Saintess, it felt extremely ridiculous.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you to take care of that man.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u00a0 I\u2019ll wake him up as soon as it gets bright and let him go.\u201dWhen he heard the answer, Latban turned away.He walked down the hall for a long time and headed for his office at the far end of the hall.\u00a0 As he opened the door to the luxurious office, the ceiling and walls with ornate carvings the same as the door could be seen immediately.\u00a0 But those were the only spectacular sights in the room.\u00a0 Only a desk and a chair could be seen inside the office.\u00a0 There was also only one bookshelf and one drawer.\u00a0 The small room next to it also has only a few low tables and chairs for occasional guests.It was so desolate enough that anyone would think it was just an empty room.Even if the knights or priests who visited this place asked Latban to decorate his office a little more, Latban refused. To him, things that are not necessary were just luxury that the Temple\u2019s knights should stay away from.Latban took off his robe, hung it on the hanger, and sat on a chair in front of the table.\u00a0 Unusually, he buried himself deep in the chair.\u00a0 Then he swept his face with his hands.\u2018What was it?\u2019The face of the Saintess that she saw at the Temple\u2019s back garden continued to disturb his mind.And after meeting eyes with the Saintess during the afternoon in Central Square, he couldn\u2019t calm down all day.He thought he had to keep his composure, but he kept thinking of what happened that day.\u00a0 The day when the Saintess deliberately insulted him.Eventually, he told the knight who was assigned to do the night watch that he would guard around instead.\u00a0 He was thinking that maybe if he walked alone even a little, he would calm down.As he walked inside the Great Temple by himself, he headed to the back garden that he would not usually enter.\u00a0 This is because he wanted to walk in a quiet place rather than a place where people roam.\u00a0 But the moment he heard the voices of the Saintess and a man, he regretted his choice.It seemed that the most disgusting aspect of the person he doesn\u2019t want to witness the most is unfolding.If he hadn\u2019t heard the voice of the Saintess calling for someone as he was about to turn around right away, he would have immediately left the garden.After throwing the man away who was on top of her, the Saintess looked at him for a long time.\u00a0 Latban felt strange about the gaze.\u00a0 The Saintess was looking at him as if she had never seen him before.\u00a0 From the gaze of such a Saintess, he did not see the ridicule that was always there every time she looked at him.\u00a0 Because of that, Latban also looked straight at her without avoiding her.Is the person in front of him Yvelina?\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dLatban sighed and shook his head.\u00a0 These days, his heart seems to be distracted.\u00a0 He can\u2019t believe he\u2019s thinking about this kind of crap.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLatban got up from his seat and went to his desk.\u00a0 Some of the documents he had to deal with were waiting for him.\u00a0 Then Latban\u2019s eyes narrowed while looking at the documents at the top.\u201cPrayer Meeting Escort\u2026.\u201dNaturally, the Knight\u2019s Commander is in charge of the Saintess\u2019 security right next to her.\u00a0 But at this year\u2019s prayer meeting, he was almost certain to take on a different job. And as expected, the document was asking him to manage the entire prayer hall, not the protection of the Saintess.\u2018What should I do?\u2019Latban looked at the document for a long time. And until the morning sun rose, Latban couldn\u2019t leave his desk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My daily routine is tightly organized in chronological order.\u00a0 None of them were unimportant.\u00a0 Among them, checking this prayer was the most important thing.\u2018I was so dumbfounded when they said that I have to memorize all these prayers at first.\u2019When I first saw the thickness of the paper stacked on the desk, I bluntly looked at the priests and the papers alternately with a blank face.\u00a0 It was by no means the amount that a person could memorize within two weeks.\u00a0 No, what two weeks?\u00a0 There are less than 10 days left to actually prepare.The priests also bowed their heads, asking me to do as much as possible with a small voice, even if they knew it was near impossible.\u00a0 However, while reviewing the prayers, there was something new I learned.\u2018Yvelina memorized more than I thought.\u2019When I first heard that I had to memorize all of them, I wondered if I could hold out pretending to be Yvelina.\u00a0 But when I began to read the prayer that the priest had brought, I felt amazed.\u00a0 Prayers that were supposed to be unfamiliar were read smoothly.It didn\u2019t end with just reading the text.\u00a0 Yvelina\u2019s body apparently remembered most of those prayers.\u00a0 So the preparation was done quickly.\u2018When on earth did you memorize all of these?\u2019I remembered Yvelina\u2019s old memory.\u00a0 Yvelina\u2019s body in my memory was very small.\u00a0 And the priests around her seemed strangely large.\u00a0 I think it was a memory when she was very young.\u00a0 In that memory, Yvelina sat at her desk all day writing prayers.\u2018Did you memorize everything starting from an early age that\u2019s why your body still remembers?\u2019It was written in the book that Yvelina entered the temple at quite a young age and held a succession ceremony.\u00a0 Perhaps at that time, she steadily fulfilled her duties as a Saintess and took lessons.\u00a0 Anyway, when I was thinking that I was fortunate, I heard a loud noise over the door.\u201cI must see the Saintess!\u201dIt was a familiar voice.\u00a0 And it was also a very unpleasant voice.\u00a0 Soon the priests called me with a rush of knocking on the door.\u201cSaintess, Priest Carus is asking for an audience.\u201dI wondered if I should send him back as it is.\u00a0 But I soon shook my head.\u00a0 It occurred to me that if I did not meet that Priest Carus now, it would cause a bigger problem later.\u201cTell him to come in.\u201d\u201cYes, Saintess.\u00a0 Priest\u2026 Agh!\u201dThe moment the voice of the layman from outside was cut off, the door opened violently.\u00a0 Soon afterward, Priest Carus came into the room with a thud.\u00a0 The other priests tried to come in after him.\u201cI ask everyone to go out.\u201d\u201cBut Saintess\u2026.\u201d\u201cImmediately.\u201dThe other priests did not know what to do in response to the firm order, but after some deliberation, they withdrew saying to call for them if I needed anything.\u00a0 When the priests disappeared, Carus immediately screamed.\u201cHow could you do this to me?!\u201dHis face frowned at his shout.\u2018Rude.\u2019I had that thought unknowingly.\u00a0 Carus is a senior priest.\u00a0 Although he may have a high position in the Great Temple, he was never in a position to dare shout at the Saintess.\u00a0 As expected, this man should be thrown out as soon as possible.\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dAs I was wondering how I could throw this Priest Carus away, his face distorted.\u201cAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know?\u00a0 Didn\u2019t you assign another person seated in the empty high priest\u2019s position at this prayer meeting?!\u201dIt was as he said.\u00a0 I appointed a high-ranking priest other than Carus to the position of the high priest who is currently unable to work in the temple due to his old age.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t just pick anyone.\u00a0 I searched Yvelina\u2019s memory and found a high priest who had constantly advised her.\u00a0 And even though Yvelina openly ignored him and kicked him out to the corner of the Great Temple, it was a priest that never gave up and instead sent letters to Yvelina every day.The other priests around me were surprised when I appointed him as the substitute for the high priest. Their \u2018this can\u2019t be possible\u2019 expressions showed that I had done my job properly.\u00a0 Everybody would have made that face because it was an appointment that Yvelina would never have done.\u00a0 Perhaps if Yvelina\u2019s soul was still in her body, she would surely have appointed Carus as the substitute high priest.\u2018The book clearly said that the appointment of the priest, who was incapable of holding the prayer meeting, ended up as the worst prayer meeting ever.\u2019That was not the only thing I did while preparing for the prayer meeting.\u00a0 I also changed all the people Yvelina had chosen before.\u00a0 Just in case, I met them before making the final change, but I could see that they were all ineligible without having to search Yvelina\u2019s memories.\u00a0 Because when I went to see them, they were all drunk in their rooms in the temple.\u2018How the hell did Yvelina choose, that she appointed only the worst kind of people?\u2019It\u2019s as if she was deliberately determined to ruin the prayer meeting.\u201cAre you listening to me?!\u201dNo, I wasn\u2019t listening.But I couldn\u2019t say that, so I just nodded.\u00a0 Carus raised his voice even more at my attitude.\u201cYou can\u2019t do this to me! You know better than anyone how hard I\u2019ve worked for the things you\u2019ve asked me secretly!\u201dWith such a loud voice, the requests seemed to be no longer secret requests.\u201cHigh Priest Carus.\u00a0 I recall that I told you last time to not bring them in anymore.\u201d\u201cBut.\u2026\u201d\u201cBut instead you ignored my words and brought someone from the outside as you please.\u00a0 And that person\u2026 have done a great disrespect to me.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to say that that man tried to force me and attacked me because I was disgusted.\u00a0 As if noticing that my voice is getting stronger, Carus pursed his lips.\u201cYou\u2026 I remember all the efforts you\u2019ve made for me.\u201dBringing the men and pushing them into Yvelina\u2019s bed is an effort.\u00a0 If I could, I would like to imprison Carus in the dungeon right away, but I couldn\u2019t.\u00a0 After all, it is true that Yvelina had spent many promiscuous nights with unfamiliar men in the past in collaboration with Carus.\u00a0 It\u2019s not something that can be erased by trying from now on.\u2018In that case, I should handle it as quietly as possible.\u2019Of course, I was intending to deal with Carus.\u00a0 But as quietly as I could, I was even willing to pay a great price to keep his mouth shut, at least until Iris appeared.I ordered Carus, who couldn\u2019t hold his anger and was continuously screaming.\u201cPriest Carus, pick up any piece of paper on the table.\u201d\u201cWhat useless\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make me say it twice.\u00a0 I don\u2019t have the patience for you anymore.\u201dEven if I didn\u2019t try very hard, a cold voice naturally came out.\u00a0 As if he had noticed the change, he simply followed my instructions.\u00a0 Seeing him pick up the paper, I ordered.\u201cRead the first line.\u201d\u201cWhat useless\u2026 God looked down at this land, and soon the suffering of men that was overflowing everywhere\u2026.\u201dAs he read that far, I got up and grabbed the paper in his hand.\u00a0 Then I turned it on its back.\u201cNow tell me what\u2019s after that.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? How will I know if I don\u2019t look?\u201d\u201cPriest Carus.\u00a0 Written on that piece of paper is the prayer that will be used in the ceremony of the prayer meeting.\u00a0 It should be memorized not only by me as the Saintess but also by the high priest who will assist me. However\u2026.\u201dI looked at the desk.\u00a0 Dozens of prayers were there.\u201cDo you have any prayers here that you have already memorized from start to finish?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201dCarus couldn\u2019t answer.\u00a0 There was nothing that he had memorized.\u00a0 He bowed his head.\u00a0 I could see his shoulders trembling as if he had no intention of hiding his anger.\u201cI will not turn a blind eye for all the help that you\u2019ve given me.\u00a0 So, as soon as possible, as to not disappoint you\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201dSuddenly, papers scattered in my sight.\u00a0 Carus threw the paper on the desk on the floor.\u00a0 And his eyes, glaring at me, were red with a burst of blood.\u00a0 He gritted his teeth with eerie eyes.\u201cYou\u2019ll definitely regret that you didn\u2019t choose me, Saintess.\u201dCarus said so and immediately went out.\u00a0 The priests standing in front of the door were surprised by the sudden burst of the door, but he stomped away without even looking back.I looked at his back quietly and bent down.\u00a0 I thought it would be better to clean up the paper that fell on the floor before the other priests came in and made a fuss.\u2018I\u2019m wrong to think of cleaning it up quietly.\u2019I tried to give Carus adequate fortune and send him away, but he seemed to have much greater ambition than I thought.As I was cleaning the papers, a piece of paper with no prayers on it came into my eyes.\u201cThis\u2026.\u201dIt was a document on the security issue of the prayer meeting.\u00a0 It said that Latban was excluded from the personal security of the Saintess; and that he was to take over the entire administration of the prayer meeting.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2018Although I knew this would happen\u2026.\u2019Of course, I knew that Latban would not be a part of the Saintess\u2019 security personnel.\u00a0 After all, isn\u2019t it rather strange for him to stand by Yvelina as if nothing had happened?\u00a0 I insulted him and there was an awkward situation in the back garden last time. He took the man who crashed into the tree without asking, which means he knows how and for what purpose the man entered the temple.Still, I felt somehow dejected.No matter how hard you try from now on, the future won\u2019t change.When suddenly, I heard a whisper saying those words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All of the priests who saw me like that have an expression of understanding on their faces.Far from sleeping comfortably, I stayed up all night with my eyes wide open. From a few days ago, the sound from people gathering in front of the Great Temple could be heard across the wall even at dawn. When I asked the priests, they said that there are a lot of people who came even from the end of the continent just to wait for the prayer meeting.\u201cIt\u2019s an event that everyone wants to attend once in their lifetime.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that there are a lot of people who carried their children on their backs, and a lot of people who brought their parents whose lives were numbered.\u201d\u201cThey said there\u2019s a huge fight over the seats for the blessings of the Saintess that will be held last at the Central Square.\u201dEvery time I heard the news from the priests every day, my heart became heavy.

Since possessing this body, I have been doing well without making any major mistakes. No one has noticed that I am not Yvelina yet. Thinking so, I pressed the tip of my finger firmly. Then my gaze met with a priest. She looked at my behavior and nodded as if to reassure me.\u201cDon\u2019t worry too much. It ended well last year, so there won\u2019t be any problems this year.\u201dI think that she could see that I\u2019m nervous. I felt like I was caught inside, so I avoided her gaze without saying anything. Then the priest went out for a while and came back with a cup of tea in one hand.\u201cUsually, it\u2019s much better not to eat anything, but if you drink something warm, you\u2019ll feel a little relaxed.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dIn fact, I\u2019ve been in a light fast for the prayer meeting since last night. I took the tea from the priest and swallowed a sip, careful not to remove my makeup. The warm energy spread through my body, and the trembling hand finally stopped.\u2018This is just the beginning.\u2019A lot of things happened to Yvelina until Iris came to the Great Temple and became the Saintess. Of course, it was all about losing her reputation. Although this prayer meeting may be the largest in scale, there is a line of more troublesome and frustrating events, and I could not withdraw from here.\u2018You can do it.\u2019As I made dozens of resolutions inside my head, the door opened and a priest came in with a troubled expression. He whispered something to the priests around him, and the faces of the priests who heard him hardened.What on earth did he say that made them look like that? I put down my tea and observed the priests. My question grew even more as the priests continued to whisper as if they didn\u2019t want to be heard by me.When I couldn\u2019t stand my curiosity anymore and tried to ask, a priest approached me and said cautiously.\u201cSaintess, if you don\u2019t mind, how about changing the schedule of the prayer meeting a little?\u201d\u201c\u2026Reschedule? Why and how are we going to change it?\u201dThis can\u2019t be happening. Over the past few days, I memorized the schedule of the prayer meeting and spent several times practicing the prayers. Now you\u2019re just suddenly going to change the schedule, and on the morning of the exact day at that?\u201cOr let\u2019s skip the blessing of the people in Central Square for now\u2026.\u201dI gasped at those words. At the end of the prayer meeting, the Saintess goes out to Central Square and gives a blessing to the general public who came to the temple. It was also the most important schedule of the event. But you\u2019re saying to skip the schedule? However, the priests around the area responded as if it was a relief. I asked with a stiff face.\u201c\u2026What\u2019s going on?\u201dHe has a nervous look on his face when he came in, and the way he was talking with the other priests; something must have happened.The priest looked troubled when I asked him.\u201cDon\u2019t try to hide it and just tell me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026.\u201dThe priest, who hesitated as if his mouth couldn\u2019t open, closed his eyes and said.\u201c\u2026Groundless rumors spread to those who were waiting in front of the temple.\u201d\u201cGroundless rumors?\u201d\u201cThey said that the Saintess\u2026 inside the temple\u2026 every day with some men\u2026.\u201dThe priest said and then bowed his head. Oh My God. At his words, I touched my forehead. Even if he didn\u2019t say anything more, I could fully see what rumors were circulating outside.\u2018It\u2019s not groundless rumors though.\u2019Because Yvelina really did those things. The real problem is, why does it have to come up in people\u2019s mouths right now? Why, of all days, today?!\u201cSo the atmosphere is not good?\u201d\u201c\u2026A little.\u201dThat\u2019s impossible. They are the priests who acted as if it would be a big deal if they skipped anything from the ceremony. It meant that the atmosphere outside was really bad if they asked to skip the most important procedure.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that because of that little thing I can\u2019t do the most important ceremony of the prayer meeting?\u201d\u201c\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7.\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is going on out there?\u201d\u201cTh-that\u2026.\u201dWhen he hesitated, I beckoned to the priests standing nearby to go out. When there were only the two of us left in the room, I told him again.\u201cTell me exactly what you heard. I don\u2019t intend to hold you accountable.\u201dUpon saying so, the priest opened his mouth again.\u201cA very malicious rumor has spread among the crowds. Among them, there seem to be those who blame their sickness or bad luck on the Saintess. They said they were sick because the Saintess did something atrocious in the eyes of God\u2026 So to the Saintess\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026They\u2019re going to harm me. Is that it?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right. It is clear that the heathens at the end of the continent are spreading rumors on purpose. Or maybe the wizards. Even if people who enter Central Square are searched for, it is difficult to prevent those who have decided to hide something. If anyone comes up with a weapon and harms the Saintess\u2026 Besides, without Commander Latban this year, it is more dangerous\u2026.\u201dThe priest who was talking quickly shut his mouth. He seems to have been more surprised by the name he accidentally uttered. Every time Latban\u2019s name was mentioned, Yvelina reacts very nervously, so it is no exaggeration to say that he\u2019ll be surprised.\u2018What am I supposed to do anyway?\u2019The atmosphere must be so bad that they think something will happen, stopping me from attending the event.\u2018Yvelina was already steadily building her notoriety.\u2019I know that the insults to Latban have also spread outside the Great Temple. It was at this prayer meeting that such accumulated notoriety quickly spread throughout the continent.I could see the dreary future in front of me. Even if I attend this prayer meeting or not, will it eventually flow as the book says?At that moment someone whispered inside me.\u2018Why are you trying so hard to change the future?\u2019I\u2019ve already died once. My current life, which started when I opened my eyes to Yvelina\u2019s body, is like a gift I have never expected.\u2018Then you can just stay still until the end comes, right?\u2019Wouldn\u2019t it be better to leave it alone if it doesn\u2019t change whatever I do? After all, there are only two years left before Yvelina dies. Compared to the times when I was unable to do anything in the hospital, the two years that I can enjoy with a healthy body will be like heaven.\u201cSaintess\u2026.\u201dI looked up at the priest\u2019s voice. He was waiting for my decision.If we remove the last procedure in front of the people, there weren\u2019t many parts I would attend at the prayer meeting. No, in fact, I won\u2019t have to attend the prayer meeting anymore at all.\u2018In the book, Yvelina refused to attend the prayer meeting, saying she was not feeling well.\u2019For that reason, it was known all over the continent that she was a Saintess who had abandoned her duties. But that didn\u2019t mean that Yvelina\u2019s life was threatened like right now. Until Iris appeared, Yvelina had lived as a Saintess inside the temple. So, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem if I didn\u2019t do all these now and live as the story itself unfolds.I could just do nothing, live comfortably, and wait for my end. To live quietly and wait for the book\u2019s ending to come.\u2018I don\u2019t want to.\u2019I didn\u2019t want to live like that. If I were going to live like that, I wouldn\u2019t have had to come to enter this body.The \u2018me\u2019 who once died, was grateful for this opportunity given to me. And I don\u2019t intend to just enjoy this luck I was given. As long as I have this luck in my hands, I wanted to try to hold onto it for as long as possible because I didn\u2019t know until when I would be holding on to it.I walked and opened the door. Then all of the eyes of the people standing outside focused on me. Between them, I saw the long dark corridor with no end in sight that I have to walk on. It looked like the future I had to go to.Now I have to walk that road alone. The moment I tried to take a step while thinking so.\u201cLet me escort you.\u201dSuddenly, a big hand approached with a familiar voice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There stood Latban, perfectly dressed in a white and gold robe, just like mine. At the appearance of a person who was very unlikely to be in this place, I couldn\u2019t say anything for a moment and just looked at him.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201dHe shouldn\u2019t be here when Latban himself said he would not guard the Saintess at this prayer meeting. Then why is this man suddenly reaching his hand now? He lowered his head slightly and with an expressionless face and said.\u201cIt is my duty to protect the Saintess.\u201dThose words reminded me of what Latban was like in the book. I can\u2019t believe he came back to do his duty until the end, even though he despised the Saintess so much.I looked at the hand he was extending. The big hand that most of the time only holds a sword had rough scars that were not possible to heal even with the holy power.I raised my head and looked up at him. He was standing still waiting for me to reach out. The black eyes that were looking at me were steady. Again, the endless corridor caught my eye. I looked there for a long time before I put my hand on his hand.\u2018Perhaps one day this hand will kill Yvelina, this hand will kill me.\u2019Slowly, I grabbed the tip of his finger. Unlike the cold impression, I felt a warm body temperature. I smiled softly at him.\u201cPlease take care of me, Sir Latban.\u201d\u2018Even if one day you kill me. But until we reach the end of this corridor, I\u2019ll hold your hand.\u2019The prayer meeting began with the loud sound of a trumpet. People flooded into the door of the temple in the morning. The central square, which was usually idle, was filled with people in no time. It was not an exaggeration to say that people from all countries of the continent came.Not only those who are wearing the clothes of the Empire closest to the Great Temple, but as well as those who are still wearing fur clothes that are not suitable for this cool season. On the other hand, some people wore light clothes that looked bare.I could hear people who missed their party shouting in search of each other, and there were those who were chanting the temple\u2019s hymn loudly without hiding their excitement. The noise barely subsided with the ringing of a bell announcing the beginning of the first ceremony.\u2018Amazing.\u2019That\u2019s all I could think of as I watched the crowd over the closed windows. When I first looked around the Great Temple, I was surprised by its size. When I heard the number of people living inside, I was even more astonished with its scale that is beyond my imagination. But now, I was amazed once more at the crowds that gathered to fill it.Attendance at this prayer meeting does not mean that the temple gives them money or goods. They are all faithful believers of God. Therefore, they used their own money just to go to this place with overflowing faith.\u2018I can\u2019t believe all those people came by themselves.\u2019I\u2019ve never counted such a crowd, so I don\u2019t even know how many people are there. There are more people than what I remembered I saw on the news in my past life, which I estimated and counted at my disposal, which was over 100,000 or more.\u2018And they said there were more people who couldn\u2019t get inside the temple and were stuck outside.\u2019If so, it was said that there were hundreds of thousands of people who came to this prayer meeting. Soon the singing of the choir began, and the sound of their songs spread to people like waves. Perhaps because it was a basic hymn that the entire continent knew, the scene where everyone sang together as one was so magnificent that it gave me goosebumps.As I watched everyone close their eyes with a serious face and sing along to the hymn, I thought again about the position of God, the Saintess, and the Great Temple in this world.\u2018The absolute faith and respect of those living on the continent.\u2019That is the general sentiment of the people of the continent towards the Saintess. I don\u2019t know why, but I believed in God that didn\u2019t help me in my past life, but at least in this world, the power of God was evident.\u2018Because it was said that demons appear in pagan lands.\u2019In the land of those who do not worship God, demons constantly appear. And although it also appears in the lands of those who worship God, the number is sharply different compared to the land of the pagans. And whenever that happens, the Knights of the Temple go there to deal with the demons.\u2018Because the demons hated holy power, it was said that all the knights\u2019 swords were blessed by the priests.\u2019I remembered the holy power I saw when I opened the door of the secret passage. With such visible power of God, faith in this world is inevitably absolute. Furthermore, the power has to do with their lives.It struck me again that Yvelina was great. People are bound to try to meet the expectations of the people around them. That\u2019s how I used to live.\u201cYou\u2019re not like other children. You\u2019re the first one who doesn\u2019t complain about this long hospitalization.\u201dWhen the doctor in charge of me complimented me by saying so, my parents showed a faint smile as if they were proud of me. After that, until the moment of my death, I never complained. Not to fall short of their expectations.It wasn\u2019t hateful or hard. If I acted like that and the people around me loved me more and were proud of me, I was willing to do so. It\u2019s not wrong to want to look better to those who love you.\u2018But why did Yvelina\u2026.\u2019Even I was afraid to deviate from the expectations of just a few people. However, Yvelina turned a blind eye to the expectations of all those people, and the entire continent. She didn\u2019t even change her attitude when she saw that the failed expectations returned with disappointment and anger. But instead, she started to get even more twisted.In a way, I thought she was very brave. Just by thinking that everyone who gathers over there at the square swears and accuses me, a cold sweat will definitely flow behind my back. As I was looking down like that, I heard a knock on the door from outside. At the sound, Latban who was also inside the room opened the door. The priests, who were waiting outside, bowed their heads and said.\u201cThe last ceremony of the day is about to begin.\u201d\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201dIt finally came. The priests\u2019 faces were also tense.\u2018So far, nothing troublesome has happened.\u2019When I stood out in front of people on the terrace, I was worried that something like an arrow would fly from far away.\u2018Even though I know it\u2019s not going to happen.\u2019The Saintess\u2019 holy powers can be used in a variety of ways. And among them, the protective barrier that can protect oneself from external attacks was also the most basic force of the holy power. If there is an attack, the Saintess could protect herself with her own holy power, so a sword, bow, or other weapons cannot harm the Saintess.\u2018But that\u2019s the story if I was the real Yvelina.\u2019Strangely enough, Yvelina\u2019s memory showed nothing about the use of her holy power. Therefore, I am still unable to use any power other than the automatically appearing holy power. If someone attacks me now, I have no choice but to be defenseless.\u2018Fortunately, there won\u2019t be an attack because people don\u2019t know that.\u2019It was also believed that I would attend the last ceremony.\u201cI\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dLatban spoke to the priests, then stood next to me again and reached out his hand. Some of the priests did not hide their expressions of surprise at Latban\u2019s actions. After suffering the insult, they seemed to be moved by Latban, who still carried out his duties until the end. I stood about half a step away from him, feeling the heat from Latban\u2019s hand as I took it.\u2018It would be better to keep my distance as much as possible.\u2019Then Latban looked at me for a moment.\u2018Should I step back a little bit more?\u2019However, when I tried to take another half step away, he pulled my hand. Because of that, I had to walk side by side with him without getting further away.\u201cSaintess! Saintess! Please bless me!\u201d\u201cIt took me two months! I waited for this week in front of the Great Temple and I was able to finally come forward. Please give my child a blessing!\u201dAs I went down to Central Square, people\u2019s cries rang in my ears like thunder. The knights and the priests were desperately blocking them. But as soon as the Saintess was seen, it seemed that it was not enough to stop all the people who terrifyingly approached.In that situation, Latban ordered the knights standing around me to strengthen their guard again. Then the knights responded vigorously, saying, \u201cUnderstood.\u201d They stopped the people who were approaching without showing any signs of fatigue. Thanks to this, a path that I could barely pass was made.As they began to walk that path, people reached out among the knights and shouted for prayers of blessing again. As I hesitated while looking at those hands, the priest, who was walking in front of me earlier, approached and whispered quietly.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, I\u2019ll arrange the procession to just walk past it just like last year. They\u2019ll consider it the greatest glory of their lives just by seeing the Saintess in person\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay.\u201dIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to reach. Rather, I was thinking about how to reach as many people as possible. Among the people who reached out to me, many of them looked sick. Holy Power heals trauma or poison. But with illness, it can only temporarily improve the condition, it cannot be cured completely. Especially those diseases caused by old age. Maybe it is because we cannot resist what comes naturally according to the providence created by God. But people were still clinging to it even though they knew that fact.I remembered the lady who was in the bed next to me in the hospital.\u201cThere\u2019s no cure for my illness.\u201dThe lady, who was speaking calmly, sent an email to the radio station she always listened to. Maybe because she was unlucky, but even after sending it dozens of times, her story did not come out. Then finally, the lady\u2019s story was introduced. The lady, who was always lethargic, listened to the show with her eyes glistening and with a flushed face at that moment.To our letter sender. Even though you\u2019re sick now, don\u2019t lose hope that you\u2019ll be able to shake it off and get better.Now that I think about it, it wasn\u2019t particularly a great story. However, the young lady repeatedly listened to the recorded DJ\u2019s voice. Even the moment she entered the intensive care unit, she\u2019s smiling. She knew the broadcast couldn\u2019t cure her illness, but it gave the lady hope and peace.I raised my head. I looked at the hands reaching out for me. If I could give them that peace even if I\u2019m not the real Saintess, then I will reach out to as many as I can. As soon as I tried to approach while thinking so, the end of the line collapsed and someone rolled around the ground. As a result of that, the hood the man was wearing came off, and the people around me screamed for a short time and backed away. Under the peeled hood, I saw the face of an old man full of wrinkles. And a scabrous skin full of unknown diseases. The old man looked at me, bowed down, and begged.\u201cSaintess! Please give me a prayer of blessing!\u201dI looked at the old man and said to Latban.\u201cCommander Latban, can you bring him to me?\u201dJudging from the situation, it seemed that if I approached right away, more people would flock around and cause a disturbance. Due to my words, Latban tried to call for another knight, but when he realized that there was no one to call, he turned around.It was then.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But not so hard as to knock me down.Mucus dripped down from my hair. It smelled really bad. It didn't take me long to guess what this mucus thing was, for there were a lot of broken eggshells scattered around my feet. From the bad smell, it must be a rotten egg.Not yet fully aware of what had just happened, another cry rang out.\"Everyone knows you like to screw with several men at once each night!\"Again, something from the crowd was seen flying toward me. For some reason, this time I thought it wasn't an egg. Closing my eyes reflexively, something red covered my vision instead. Followed by the warmth of one's body, then a thud.\"Catch him.\"Command Latban. His low voice sent chills all over my body. His short, spitting words were filled with suppressed anger.Only then did I realize. Latban protected me from the throwing attack. Wrapped by his cloak, I was held by his arms so I could not see what happened outside. Only the screams of the knights and people could be heard.\"Every night the priests will get into your crotch!\"It was the voice of the person throwing the rotten egg earlier. My body froze at that. What he said was true. Maybe not every night, but Yvelina indeed did that.\"Shut him up.\"As Latban opened his mouth again, the man's swearing stopped with a thud. Replaced by the buzzing sound of people around him.\"Is the rumor true?\"\"I've heard it. They say so many men sell holy items given by the Saintess.\"\"I've heard it's not much of a secret in the Great Temple. Many priests talk about it themselves.\"The small murmur soon turned into a big roar. People's attitudes who suddenly changed even though they shouted for my blessing not long ago made me wonder if that was all a lie? The rumor must have spread thoroughly.For them, rumors turned into facts as soon as someone was seen calling me a dirty whore while throwing a rotten egg.Now, there was no need for the man to shout and swear anymore. People have naturally raised their voices.\"I think it would be better to go back inside,\" said Latban lowering his head to me under the cloak. I couldn't answer.I was scared. If I decided to look outside now, I was scared of people's gazes that would fall on me. Even if the rumor was not something I did, as long as I live as Yvelina, then I have to accept all the insults and looks of disgust from people.\"Dirty whore! How many longers do you want to hide behind the Temple Knights?! Hey, people, you all should know too! My relative said...!\"Did Latban move this time? The big body hugging me shook, followed by a thud, then the screams of the person who cursed at me a whore stopped.\"I'll take you.\"Latban seemed impatient waiting for my answer. However, the moment he led me to move, I grabbed him by the arm.\"Wait.\"Latban stopped moving. I took off the cloak covering my body. The rotten egg mucus that slid from my hair was dirtying his cloak. Did he think I'd just come back in like that?The people who had been swearing at me with enthusiasm fell silent as soon as they saw me showing up.It was then that I realized that whatever I was about to say in front of them wouldn't stop the rumors already circulating.'No matter what I try, will it still end up like the plot in the novel?'Unlike the story in the novel, although now I\u2014as Yvelina\u2014attended the prayer meeting as scheduled, the dirty rumors still spread.'Then,'I turned away from the disdainful gaze of the people. Among them, there was one whose existence was forgotten at the moment. He was the old man who had toppled over due to the strong urge around him. I walked over to the old man. What used to be crowds of people competing to get close to me, now they're backing away. The old man was still in his place, not moving.\"Are you still hoping for my blessing?\" I asked.The old man nodded. I stepped closer and put my palm on his head. His hideously distorted skin and the bad smell didn't surprise me. I had often seen much more similar severe conditions in the hospital.\"May God be with you always, even in the most difficult moments and in the happiest moments. He will be with you whenever you want.\"There were many words of blessing. I memorized dozens of them for this ceremony, but this would have been its end. Then I bowed my head and kissed the old man's head.Just as radio broadcasting became a prop for one person's life, I hope this fake saintess' blessing will also be a strength to this old man.The old man raised his head and looked at me.\"Thank you, Saintess.\"\"......!\"The moment our eyes met I realized...'He's not an old man!'His blue eyes that stared at me looked frighteningly bright. There was no sign of lethargy or fatigue due to an illness. Instead, his eyes gleamed with joy and curiosity as if he had just found something interesting.As the man was about to get up, he stretched out his hand. Then grabbing my hair which ran down his shoulder. It wasn't rough, but I had to keep looking at him, unable to get up.He took my hair and slowly brought it to his lips. After a gentle kiss, he looked at me and said,\"I look forward to seeing you again.\"\u2727 \u2727 \u2727First day of the prayer meeting, the last ceremony ended just like that.Anyone who had cursed Yvelina a dirty whore was caught by the holy knights and locked up in the temple prison. The priests sighed heavily, complaining that what they feared had happened in the end. I didn't mean to eavesdrop. I could hear their voices clearly behind the garden bushes.\"I knew this was going to happen!\"\"Now, those ugly rumors will spread throughout the continent within a month.\"\"What will they say to the Great Temple? This will be a huge disgrace to us!\"The priests' voices grew louder and louder. Then someone said,\"Really, why do we have to worry about that? Isn't this all because of the Saintess?\"\"Right. I wonder will she come to her senses after all these troubles. Everything is just so wrong.\"Their voices slowly decreased, it seemed like they were tired keep on talking about Yvelina.\"I heard they even called her the whore of the Great Temple... Now, I don't know anymore. I'm going to go get ready for the rest of the prayer meeting tomorrow.\"The main priest who started the talk left, the others followed suit.Making sure that everyone was really gone, I stood up and lay down on the garden bench. I grabbed my wet hair hanging down, smelling the strong scent of flowers.Even though I couldn't smell the rotten eggs anymore, somehow, the smell of the ceremony lingered in my nostrils.\"I'm tired...\" I murmured to myself.A lot had happened in the last one day. I had not been able to sleep well since the previous day, and had been moving around since the dawn where the prayer ceremonies continued throughout the day. But what tired me the most was the last ceremony.'I didn't expect Latban to kneel to me again.'After returning to the room, the man knelt directly in front of me on one knee and bowed his head.\"I couldn't do my duty properly. Please hold me responsible for that.\"I understood why he behaved like that. Latban was the one in charge for my security, but instead, I got hit by a rotten egg in front of many people.\"It was not your fault, Sir Latban. It was my mistake to make you do something else.\"If only I hadn't told Latban to bring the old man, he would have blocked the rotten egg without a problem. So I ordered Latban to get up from his kneeling position, but he didn't move an inch.\"It is my responsibility if the Saintess is injured for any reason.\"Latban's manner was too firm. Unless I let him take responsibility for what happened, this guy definitely won't budge.\"...Alright. I'll hold you responsible for the guard's mistake, but not now. Please carry out your mission unchanged until the prayer meeting is over tomorrow.\"\"But...!\"\"It's an order. Get out of here.\"Like Latban, I imitated his firmness. Whether to hold him responsible or not, I have no intention of saying anything at this time. I didn't have the mental capacity to do that.So, when I said it was an order, Latban reluctantly withdrew.\"Now what?\"I muttered, looking up at the night sky. And not a single good idea came to mind. I tried to find the lightest punishment in Yvelina's memory, but all that popped out was the harshest.\"I don't know.\"First of all, maybe I should put aside the Latban punishment. I had more nagging questions floating in my head.'Who is that man?'The man who pretended to be an old man and asked for my blessing.'For what purpose?'I grabbed my hair again and lifted it up, staring at the part where the man kissed. Thinking hard but nothing came to mind.'I look forward to seeing you again...'There was strength in his voice. I could feel it. That the man will surely come and see me again.I was curious about the man's identity but oddly wasn't worried. From the way he looked at me, he seemed happy. I did not feel any hostility.'It was the crowd around him who were far more dangerous.'I suddenly felt like crying remembering what they had said.'Why do they call Yvelina a whore?'If she was really a whore, she should have been the one selling her body for money. But Yvelina did just the opposite. She held the men who came to her and gave them lots of money and valuables. Not that her attitude was commendable, but it just felt unfair.\"I have to prepare for tomorrow's prayer meeting...\"Earlier after taking a shower, I decided to lie down on the garden bench for a while feeling the night breeze. My eyes closed by themselves. I had to go back to my room using the secret passage, but my limp body won't move.'Let's stay a little longer.'In the end, I fell into a very deep slumber.And when I woke up again, I was already on the bed in my room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although my body was weary, I felt quite exhilarated. I could sense the magnitude of the temple and truly realize that this place was a different world, as I gazed at the ever-changing scenery before my eyes.With the setting sun painting the sky, a mixture of orange and purple, and enormous birds soaring through the air wearing clothes unlike any I had seen before, I felt a thrill like never before. I couldn\u2019t help but think that this place felt like a stage in a theatrical production, knowing that it was a world within the pages of a book.\u201cEveryone is alive.\u201dWhile lying in the hospital bed, there were often times when I had to watch the TV that other patients next to me were watching. Even though it was tuned in, no one bothered to watch the TV in the afternoon, as monotonous news and documentaries from distant lands played.But I found it most fascinating. Even when I secretly watched videos on my phone under the blanket at night, I always watched travel videos to far-off places. Imagining myself traveling to those places someday.Could it be that I am now fulfilling the desires I had back then?It was a completely different sensation, the exhaustion of walking throughout the hospital even though my body was in pain, and the fatigue of exploring every nook and cranny of the temple today using my own feet.Overwhelmed by the pleasant tiredness I felt for the first time, I ate and immediately fell into a deep sleep after washing up.How much time had passed? I woke up again, got out of bed, and approached the window. The cool night air greeted me pleasantly through the open window.\u201cI want to walk more.\u201dDespite having walked all day, I still wanted to walk more. Just in case Evelina\u2019s consciousness returned at this very moment. And if I were to disappear. The thought of not being able to experience the sensation of walking with a healthy body again made me anxious.I wanted to walk alone on the path I saw outside the window a little while ago. In that serene place under the moonlight. I stopped in my tracks as I tried to open the door while wearing a suitable outer garment.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dIf I were to open the door and go out like this, the attendants who had been waiting for my command outside all day would immediately swarm around me.\u201cSurely, just like in the novel\u2026\u201dA scene came to mind where Evelina would escape from the eyes of the people and engage in relationships with men within the temple. If that was the case, it meant there was a way for me to go out alone. I quickly examined Evelina\u2019s memories.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dFortunately, I soon discovered the method. Although I saw things I didn\u2019t want to see along with it. The contents of the novel were not false. The fleeting memories that came to mind were all embarrassing things that made me immediately avert my gaze. The scenes in my memories were all set in different locations, and the faces of the men were different as well. It seemed that Evelina had lived a much more licentious life than what was written in the book.Even with just a cursory examination, several faces came to mind, and it was fearful to imagine how many more men would appear if I carefully sifted through the memories.\u201cAnd, somehow, I feel sorry.\u201dThe life Evelina had lived was her own private matter. Even though I had entered Evelina\u2019s body, I felt sorry for glimpsing such explicit memories. It felt as if I were reading someone else\u2019s diary without permission.\u201cBut then again, I can\u2019t just pretend I didn\u2019t see it.\u201dEvelina\u2019s memories were the only thing I could rely on in this situation. When the day comes that the original owner of this body returns, even though it sounds absurd, I must apologize for having looked at her past memories without permission.With that thought in mind, I moved towards the inner room.The room known as the sanctuary was more like a palace than just a room. It was connected by countless rooms and corridors. I continued walking deeper inside under the radiance created by sacred light. And I opened the door of the room at the end of the corridor.[Creak] The sound accompanied as I entered into the room, revealing the appearance of a neatly arranged small room. At first glance, it seemed like a place to rest for a moment. The walls were adorned with several paintings and a large mirror, and a large wardrobe stood in one corner.Behind the paintings, behind the mirror, and behind the wardrobe, there were passageways connecting them all. I didn\u2019t know who and for what purpose these passageways were made, but Evelina used these passages to move around the temple, avoiding people\u2019s gaze.\u201cI wonder if there\u2019s a passage leading outside the temple.\u201dInquisitively, I delved into my memories, but it seemed there was nothing of that sort to be found. Nonetheless, I approached the mirror first and foremost. Upon beholding my reflection in the mirror, a peculiar sensation overcame me. Although the one moving and thinking was me, the body I saw belonged not to myself, but to Evelina. My actions would appear as Evelina\u2019s actions in the eyes of others.The fact did not evoke sadness or sorrow, but rather an uncanny feeling.Why have I found myself within the world of a book? And why in Evelina\u2019s body, of all forms? As I gazed at my reflection in the mirror for a considerable length of time, a shiver crept up my spine.\u201cFirst\u2026 the passage connected to the mirror leads to the sponsor.\u201dWith a slight push, I examined the mirror, revealing a small door that could only be entered by stooping down. Well, to call it a door was somewhat debatable. It resembled a mere drawing of a golden line on the wall, with no visible handle. No one else would ever be able to open this door. And rightly so\u2026I raised my hand to touch the door. Suddenly, a complex pattern of unknown blue light swiftly appeared on the entire surface of the door, only to vanish in an instant along with the light itself.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dIt was like magic one would witness in cartoons or movies. Experiencing it firsthand with my own eyes was a first, and the fact that I had wielded such power was astonishing.\u201cIn the book, it seemed to respond only to the powers of a saint\u2026 but\u2026\u201dA peculiar thought crossed my mind in an instant.\u201cWas Evelina not a false saint after all?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Fake Saintess Awaits Her ExitCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the final pages of the two books I read, Evelina\u2019s true identity as a fake saint is exposed, leading to her being subjected to trial. Yet, why does this door, which only responds to the power of a saint, open in response to Evelina\u2019s power?\u201cCome to think of it\u2026 When did her power completely vanish?\u201dUpon reflecting on the contents of the book, I realized that Evelina had never been deprived of her power to the point of being called a fake saint. Could it be that she is now a true saint?Standing in front of the passage, I gazed at the hand that had touched the door moments ago. The radiant blue glow that had lingered for a while had completely vanished.Behind the mirror, there was no light illuminating the passage. If I hadn\u2019t seen it several times in Evelina\u2019s memories, I wouldn\u2019t have even considered walking through it.\u201cThe path behind the mirror leads to the courtyard, the path behind the painting leads to the central square, and the path behind the wardrobe connects to the entrance of the temple.\u201dIn case I had to use different paths like today, I made sure to keep the information from Evelina\u2019s memories stored in my mind. It didn\u2019t take long for me to come face to face with a wall. Just as I had touched the door that could be called a wall within the room, I placed my palm on this wall. In an instant, the dark wall that had blocked my way disappeared, revealing the lush scenery of the courtyard.After walking out of the passage and turning back, I noticed that the entrance had been formed in a corner of the courtyard\u2019s wall. Shortly after I emerged, it transformed back into the appearance of a wall. Curious to see if my power would work properly this time, I raised my hand, and as the blue glow returned, the wall vanished, revealing the passage. Stepping back, the wall returned to its original state.Having confirmed that there were no issues with the way back to the room, I walked through the courtyard at a leisurely pace.The sounds of crying birds echoed from various places, and the buzzing of grasshoppers filled the air. It felt more comforting than frightening. Even though I was alone in the room, I always felt as though people were waiting for me outside, making me feel watched.\u201cNow I feel somewhat alive.\u201dThroughout the day, there were too many eyes observing me. At first, it was intriguing and pleasant, but soon it became tiring.When I was in the hospital, I was no different from the furniture there. Always present, taken for granted, with no one paying much attention to my existence. But if I were absent, someone would ask where I had gone, at the very least.Having grown accustomed to such a position, whenever my pace slowed even slightly or I showed interest in something, people around me would react, creating a subtle feeling within me.As I breathed in the night air, filled with the scent of trees, my mind became slightly at ease. Walking along the deserted path in the courtyard for quite some time, my previously dizzy head began to calm down.Embracing the tranquillity of the night, I strolled through the courtyard, relishing the serenity. However, after a while, my soles started to ache again. After surveying my surroundings, I found a nearby bench and reclined upon it. A refreshing breeze brushed against my face as it passed by. The sky above was brimming with stars, as though they were about to pour down. In response, a soft laughter escaped my lips.\u201cThere are two moons tonight.\u201dI found myself here, witnessing with my own eyes the realization that many novels I had read on the hospital bed served as devices to depict a world different from reality. After gazing at the two moons and the star-filled sky for quite some time, I decided to lie down and lift my legs, causing my long, slender white legs to be revealed beneath the moonlight as my clothes, which happened to be nightwear, slid down gracefully.Having walked all day long and still walking now, I could feel a slight ache in my legs.\u201cI tried to walk more because I found the pain intriguing, but perhaps I should only indulge in it until tonight. I can\u2019t possibly walk like this every day, no matter how enjoyable and exciting it may be. Besides, it is not my body subject to arbitrary torment.\u201dRaising myself slightly and gently pressing the slightly swollen leg, I was taken aback when my gaze fell upon the inner side of my thigh.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dThere was a strange mark on the inside of my thigh\u2014a bluish mark the size of just a thumbnail. It was too large and distinct to be a bug bite. I briefly wondered if it was a mark left behind from Evelina\u2019s encounters with men, but it had a completely different shape compared to the other marks on my body.\u201cThe others are not as round as this.\u201dIt looked as if someone deliberately pressed a round object to create the mark. Even one mark would be strange, but there were three in a row. It was evident that someone intentionally made these marks.Curious, I delved into Evelina\u2019s memories, but nothing came to mind. A disconcerting feeling brushed against the back of my throat. Was the lack of memory about this a sign that there was no need to remember or that I didn\u2019t want to remember?\u201cI want to erase it.\u201dWith that thought in mind, I pressed the mark with my hand. Naturally, it did not disappear. Feeling increasingly uneasy about its persistent presence, I applied more force, rubbing it vigorously. At that moment, a blue light flickered at my fingertips.Startled by the sudden light, I raised my hand, and the light disappeared instantly.\u201cTelekinesis.\u201dTelekinesis, it seemed, was easier to use than I had thought.\u201cCome to think of it, I have never properly used telekinesis before.\u201dSince entering this body, I had never used telekinesis. It was only a moment ago, when I opened and closed the passage to come here, that I witnessed telekinesis functioning properly.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I think of using it before?\u201dAccording to the book, Iris\u2019 telekinesis would diminish after a year of awakening and she would no longer be able to use it after coming to the Great Temple. Of course, it was only natural at present since there was neither a major battle nor an ongoing ceremony. But the fact that I had never attempted to use telekinesis until now was peculiar.\u201cI should have used it right away.\u201dWith that thought in mind, as I delved into Evelina\u2019s memories, I bit my lip. Just like when I tried to recall the mark on my thigh, I couldn\u2019t see anything. No, it was not just a lack of recollection; it felt like an even deeper darkness. It was as if telekinesis had firmly decided not to reside within me.\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why, then, did she never attempt to think about telekinesis?\u201cThere are many strange aspects.\u201dBoth this mark and telekinesis. The contents of the book were mostly filled with Iris\u2019 story, the protagonist. Detailed accounts of Evelina were mostly about her misdeeds. Therefore, there was no mention of these things anywhere.Perhaps if I continued to make an effort to recall, something would come to mind. That was what I was thinking at that moment.\u201cSaint, there you are!\u201dSuddenly, the voice of a strange man echoed through the air. Startled, I turned towards the source of the sound and found a man dressed in the attire of a clergyman standing there.\u201cYou are\u2026\u201d\u201cApologies for the belated introduction. I am here under the command of High Priest Karus, to escort the Lady.\u201dThe man spoke these words and then knelt before me, placing one knee on the ground. With the mention of the name Karus, I could discern his true identity. It seemed that he had misunderstood my request to Karus not to send any more men and had gone ahead to insert another one. The man continued speaking.\u201cI noticed that the lights were off in the room, and I contemplated whether to turn back. However, I recalled what I had heard from those who had previously escorted the Lady. They mentioned that you enjoy activities in the sanctuary. Taking a slight risk, I ventured here secretly\u2026 only to find that you were also present. This must undoubtedly be a sign from the divine, guiding me to you, Lady.\u201dI observed the chattering man. It was evident that his appearance was far from that of a clergyman, as his hair was excessively long. Additionally, I could catch glimpses of civilian clothing underneath his clerical robe. In fact, even without those details, he appeared far too refined to be a clergyman. Pressing my aching temples, I extended my hand towards him.\u201cPlease, leave.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cExactly as I said. Please leave promptly. Deliver my message to Karus that I do not wish for any more people to be sent.\u201dUpon hearing my words, the man became fl**tered and quickly raised his head.\u201cThat is impossible.\u201dAbruptly, the man approached me and grasped my ankle firmly.\u201cWhat are you\u2026!\u201d\u201cI can satisfy the Lady far better than those who came before. Please, do not reject me so easily.\u201dAs he spoke, he used his hand to stroke the inside of my thigh. The sensation sent shivers down my spine, and I instinctively tried to kick him away. However, his grip on my ankle remained steadfast.\u201cI have heard stories. I have heard that the men you summoned before often left them dumbfounded. Many returned without achieving anything. But I am different from those hapless fools.\u201dAfter uttering these words, the man reached over and spread my legs apart. Before I could protest, he forcefully inserted himself between them. Looking at me, he spoke again.\u201cI cannot let this opportunity, bestowed upon me through High Priest Karus, go to waste. I am determined to satisfy the Lady and, in return, receive her benevolence like others before me.\u201dAs he spoke, the man licked his lips with a lascivious expression. Revulsion coursed through my body. At that moment, thoughts of being a lady or a saint ceased to matter. I grabbed a handful of the man\u2019s hair and shouted.\u201cGet out! There\u2019s no one here! This\u2026 village!\u201dUpon hearing my scream, the man quickly covered my mouth with a startled expression.\u201cWhy, why are you acting this way? If you truly detest it, you could have punished me with your divine power. The fact that you haven\u2019t done anything until now means that even you desire me, Lady.\u201dI still didn\u2019t know how to use that divine power!With my mouth forcibly covered by the man\u2019s hand, I screamed once again. Simultaneously, I swung my hands and legs frantically, striking the man\u2019s body. That was the moment.[Crack!]The man who had been on top of me suddenly let out a groan and released his grip on my mouth. Simultaneously, his body soared into the air and collided with a tree in the sanctuary, far away.[Thunk!]How forcefully he was thrown. The branch that collided with the man made a loud crack, and the man, too, fell to the ground and rolled. Who could have thrown this man? As I turned my head, my breath caught.The black eyes that I had seen during the day were now looking directly at me.\u201cLatvan?\u201dOne of the male protagonists of this world. A paladin who serves Iris. Latvan stood there before me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Fake Saintess Awaits Her ExitCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the daylight, from a distance, I had merely thought of him as a striking individual. That was the extent of my perception. But now, with Latvan standing before me, I found myself unable to catch my breath. It was as if a mighty steel sword had transformed into a man. I beheld towering height, necessitating a tilt of my head, and broad shoulders resembling colossal walls. Donned in the white vestments of the Temple Knights, his physique was unmistakably honed beneath the garment. Simultaneously, I noticed his thick forearms and large hands. Hands so immense that they could easily crush my head with a single grasp.For a prolonged moment, I gazed at him, my thoughts seemingly frozen. My gaze gradually shifted back to his face. Only then did I truly discern it. The intense disdain embedded within Latvan\u2019s gaze directed towards me.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHis raw, unguarded emotions were impossible to conceal. In response to that gaze, I instinctively recoiled. Yet, it was futile, for the backrest of the bench hindered any further retreat.As I stared at him, he, too, scrutinized me. Then, with a firm expression, he averted his gaze. It was as though he had witnessed something he ought not to have seen. I hastened to observe my own appearance.\u201cGood heavens.\u201dWithout needing to ask about his expression, I clearly understood. The hem of my nightgown, which had ridden up as I anxiously climbed up the stairs before the man\u2019s arrival, was even more crumpled, clinging to me tightly. Consequently, my legs were fully exposed under the moonlight, revealing the obvious marks that adorned them.Quickly adjusting the hem of my gown, Latvan finally spoke, turning his head.\u201cI would prefer it if you were not visible.\u201dThose were the first words he uttered to me. His low voice, piercing through the night air, laid bare the disdain that his gaze had conveyed.Not visible, I pondered. Did he mean for me to remain unseen by his eyes or to conceal this aspect of myself from others? In truth, it mattered little which interpretation was correct.In that moment, upon hearing his voice, I realized how naively presumptuous my notion of forming amicable relationships with the male protagonists had been.The Latvan I had encountered in books was an honorable knight, faithfully serving the gods and cherishing his honor. Yet, Evelina had reduced him to a laughingstock in front of everyone. Perhaps, to Latvan, his entire life had been nothing but a subject of ridicule. And now, would my endeavors to change that make any difference?Latvan would never forgive Evelina.Just then, the man who had collided with a tree and fell emitted a groan. Regaining my composure, I rose from my seat. Then, I inclined my head towards Latvan.\u201cThank you for your assistance.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhatever the circumstance, certain words needed to be spoken. Naturally, I did not expect a response from him, nor did I anticipate one. He would not be inclined to engage in any further conversation with me.\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for Commander Latvan, something unpleasant might have happened\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was not an inconvenience, I assure you.\u201dHe interrupted me, his tone remaining chilly.\u201cNext time, please rely solely on your magical abilities. It would not be a stretch to wonder if you have even forgotten how to utilize them, given your current display.\u201dHis words left me breathless.The contents of the book resurfaced in my mind. The moment Evelina realized her magic had vanished, without a moment\u2019s hesitation, Latvan aimed his sword at her back. The longsword on her back had been crafted by Latvan himself.With those arms, with those hands, this man will kill me.In that instant, a future before me plunged into darkness.***\u201cCaptain!\u201dThe knights of the Holy Temple order were startled when they saw Latvan entering the order\u2019s building unexpectedly, as if he had taken over the evening guard duty. To their surprise, he had brought along an unknown man with him.At first sight of the man wearing priestly robes, everyone gasped in astonishment. However, it didn\u2019t take long for Latvan to realize that the man thrown at him was not a priest. In that instant, the knights\u2019 bodies stiffened with tension. The building of the order was filled with an intense atmosphere, as if someone would draw their sword at any moment. A non-priest pretending to be a priest and entering the Holy Temple was a grave offense. They needed to apprehend him immediately, verify his identity, and thoroughly investigate his purpose and how he managed to enter the temple. But Latvan\u2019s command to simply release him by morning was perplexing.Just then, one of the knights examined the fallen man and muttered, as if understanding something.\u201cHe has a peculiarly half-and-half face.\u201dThe expression on the knights\u2019 faces froze. It was no secret within the order that the maiden would lure men of dubious character every night for her own amusement. Most likely, this man was one of those men. When they realized this, the knights understood why Latvan ordered them to let him go without further questioning.After all, if the man was someone a high-ranking priest offered to the maiden, there would be no point in exposing him. No, it was more likely that he had come to the order to exert unnecessary pressure, hoping to keep his own actions hidden.One of the knights spoke to Latvan.\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better to interrogate him?\u201dIn response, Latvan asked with a retort.\u201cWhy should we?\u201dEveryone present here already knew the man\u2019s true identity. Latvan wanted an explanation as to why they had to go through such trouble.Scratching his head, the knight answered.\u201cSurely this man won\u2019t be able to keep his mouth shut for even ten minutes. We will find out who I am, how I managed to enter with the help of a high-ranking priest, and what my purpose was. So, after finishing the interrogation, if we tie him up in front of the temple along with the record, everyone passing by during the night will be well aware of what happened in the temple.\u201dThe knight\u2019s face was filled with a mocking smile. It was a derisive laugh directed at the maiden who had brought this man inside.\u201cSo, what do we gain from all this?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWhat do we gain from it? And if we check him thoroughly, he will most likely have a temporary pass to the Great Temple. He probably wore the priestly robes for some absurd reason. Then the priests involved will frantically protect him. Nothing has gone missing, and no one is injured\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Is the only thing left to laugh at the temple?\u201dThe knight who had suggested tying up the man outside and leaving him replied with a determined face.\u201cAt the very least, we can mock him, can\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cPeople will know that this woman is doing such things\u2026\u201d\u201cSidel.\u201dAt Latvan\u2019s cold voice, the knight named Sidel fell silent.\u201cBe careful with your words. When you entered the Holy Temple order, you took an oath.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSidel\u2019s face contorted. Latvan called him again.\u201cSidel.\u201dIt was a prompt for him to answer quickly.\u201cUnderstood. I will be more cautious in my words and actions regarding the maiden.\u201dSidel bowed his head before Latvan, uttering those words and promptly left. The other knights standing nearby shook their heads upon witnessing Sidel\u2019s departure.\u201cPlease understand, Sir. Sidel is particularly\u2026\u201dSidel was a knight of the sacred temple who revered Latvan more than anyone else. The knights often joked that Sidel had joined this place solely to serve Latvan. That\u2019s why, upon hearing the news that Latvan had humiliated himself in front of the saint like a dog, Sidel seemed ready to kill the saint at that very moment.However, it was unthinkable for Latvan, who had just suffered a disgraceful insult, to admonish Sidel about showing respect towards the saint.\u201cI entrust the handling of that man to you.\u201d\u201cFear not. I will wake him up and send him away as soon as dawn breaks.\u201dUpon hearing the response, Latvan turned his body.He walked along the corridor for quite some time, heading towards his office located at the far end. Upon opening the door to his opulent office, he was met with an equally resplendent ceiling and walls adorned with intricate carvings. However, the dazzling sight ended there. Inside the office, there was nothing but a desk, a chair, and a single bookshelf and drawer. The small room adjacent to it housed only a low table and a few chairs for occasional visitors.It was desolate to the point that anyone would mistake it for an empty room.Even when the knights or the temple officials who visited this place suggested that Latvan should decorate his office more, he refused them all. Anything that was not absolutely necessary was considered a luxury that the knights of the temple should distance themselves from.Latvan took off his outer robe and hung it on the coat hanger before settling down in the chair in front of the table. Unusually, he sank deep into the chair. Then, he wiped his face with his hands.\u201cWhat was it?\u201dThe face of the saint he had seen in the sanctuary kept swirling in his mind.Ever since their eyes met in the central square during the day, his mind had not been at ease.While he thought he needed to maintain composure, the events of that day kept replaying in his mind\u2014the day the saint deliberately insulted him.As a result, he volunteered to take over the night guard duty from the knights who went out for patrol. He hoped that walking alone would bring him some peace of mind.As he walked alone inside the temple, he found himself heading towards the sanctuary, a place he would usually avoid. He wanted to walk in a quieter place away from the bustling crowds. It was then that he heard the voices of the saint and the man, and he instantly regretted his choice.He would have immediately left the sanctuary if he hadn\u2019t heard the voice of the saint calling out to the people. If it weren\u2019t for that, he would have quickly left the sanctuary.After throwing the man who had been on top of the saint, the saint stared at him for a long time. Latvan felt something strange in her gaze. It was as if she was looking at him as if they were meeting for the first time. In that gaze, the scorn that had always been directed towards him was nowhere to be seen. Because of that, Latvan met her gaze without avoiding it.Is the person in front of me really Saint Evelina?[Sigh]Latvan let out a sigh, lowering his head. His mind seemed to be in turmoil lately. How foolish of him to indulge in such futile thoughts.Latvan stood up and went to his desk. A few documents awaiting his attention caught his eye.

However, this year, it was almost certain that he would be assigned a different task for the prayer assembly. As expected, the document was not about the saint\u2019s protection, but rather a request for Latvan to oversee the entire management of the prayer assembly.What should I do?Latvan stared at the document for a long time.

Is the only thing left to laugh at the temple?\u201dThe knight who had suggested tying up the man outside and leaving him replied with a determined face.\u201cAt the very least, we can mock him, can\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cPeople will know that this woman is doing such things\u2026\u201d\u201cSidel.\u201dAt Latvan\u2019s cold voice, the knight named Sidel fell silent.\u201cBe careful with your words. When you entered the Holy Temple order, you took an oath.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSidel\u2019s face contorted. Latvan called him again.\u201cSidel.\u201dIt was a prompt for him to answer quickly.\u201cUnderstood. I will be more cautious in my words and actions regarding the maiden.\u201dSidel bowed his head before Latvan, uttering those words and promptly left. The other knights standing nearby shook their heads upon witnessing Sidel\u2019s departure.\u201cPlease understand, Sir. Sidel is particularly\u2026\u201dSidel was a knight of the sacred temple who revered Latvan more than anyone else. The knights often joked that Sidel had joined this place solely to serve Latvan. That\u2019s why, upon hearing the news that Latvan had humiliated himself in front of the saint like a dog, Sidel seemed ready to kill the saint at that very moment.However, it was unthinkable for Latvan, who had just suffered a disgraceful insult, to admonish Sidel about showing respect towards the saint.\u201cI entrust the handling of that man to you.\u201d\u201cFear not. I will wake him up and send him away as soon as dawn breaks.\u201dUpon hearing the response, Latvan turned his body.He walked along the corridor for quite some time, heading towards his office located at the far end. Upon opening the door to his opulent office, he was met with an equally resplendent ceiling and walls adorned with intricate carvings. However, the dazzling sight ended there. Inside the office, there was nothing but a desk, a chair, and a single bookshelf and drawer. The small room adjacent to it housed only a low table and a few chairs for occasional visitors.It was desolate to the point that anyone would mistake it for an empty room.Even when the knights or the temple officials who visited this place suggested that Latvan should decorate his office more, he refused them all. Anything that was not absolutely necessary was considered a luxury that the knights of the temple should distance themselves from.Latvan took off his outer robe and hung it on the coat hanger before settling down in the chair in front of the table. Unusually, he sank deep into the chair. Then, he wiped his face with his hands.\u201cWhat was it?\u201dThe face of the saint he had seen in the sanctuary kept swirling in his mind.Ever since their eyes met in the central square during the day, his mind had not been at ease.While he thought he needed to maintain composure, the events of that day kept replaying in his mind\u2014the day the saint deliberately insulted him.As a result, he volunteered to take over the night guard duty from the knights who went out for patrol. He hoped that walking alone would bring him some peace of mind.As he walked alone inside the temple, he found himself heading towards the sanctuary, a place he would usually avoid. He wanted to walk in a quieter place away from the bustling crowds. It was then that he heard the voices of the saint and the man, and he instantly regretted his choice.He would have immediately left the sanctuary if he hadn\u2019t heard the voice of the saint calling out to the people. If it weren\u2019t for that, he would have quickly left the sanctuary.After throwing the man who had been on top of the saint, the saint stared at him for a long time.

I also replaced the people that Evelina had chosen. Just to be sure, before making the final change, I met them personally. They were all unsuitable, even without delving into Evelina\u2019s memories. When I went to meet them, they were all heavily intoxicated in their rooms within the temple.\u201cHow did Evelina manage to choose only such people for appointments?\u201dIt was as if she intentionally and deliberately tried to ruin the prayer ceremony.\u201cAre you listening to me!\u201dNo, I wasn\u2019t listening.But I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say that, so I simply nodded my head. In response to my attitude, Karus raised his voice even louder.\u201cYou cannot treat me like this! Do you know how hard I\u2019ve worked for the tasks you secretly entrusted to me, more than anyone else!\u201dBy shouting so loudly, it seemed that those tasks would no longer remain secret.\u201cPriest Karus, I distinctly told you not to bring those people into the temple.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cYet, you ignored my words and recklessly brought an outsider into the temple. And that person has\u2026committed a grave impudence toward me.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to utter the words that he had tried to force himself onto Evelina, even though it disgusted me. Perhaps Karus noticed that my voice was growing stiffer. He closed his mouth.\u201cYou\u2026remember well how much I\u2019ve worked for you.\u201dInviting men into Evelina\u2019s bed was considered an effort. In my heart, I wanted to immediately imprison Karus in the underground dungeon, but I couldn\u2019t do that. After all, it was a fact that Evelina had joined hands with Karus and spent l**tful nights with unfamiliar men. It was not something that would disappear just because I put in the effort to erase it.\u201cThen I must handle it quietly.\u201dOf course, I had to deal with Karus. But not loudly, not without paying a heavy price. At least until Iris appeared, I planned to keep his mouth shut.I commanded Karus, who was still resisting, with suppressed anger.\u201cPriest Karus, pick up any paper on that table.\u201d\u201cWhat useless\u2026\u201d\u201cDo not make me say it twice. I no longer have the patience for you.\u201dKarus effortlessly mustered a cold voice. Whether he recognized the change or not, he obediently followed my instructions as I watched him pick up the paper.\u201cRead the first line.\u201d\u201cWhat useless nonsense\u2026 as the gods gaze upon this land, human suffering overflows in every corner\u2026\u201dWhen he reached that point, I stood up and snatched the paper from his hand, tossing it aside.\u201cNow, continue from here.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying? How can I continue without looking\u2026\u201d\u201cKarus, acolyte. Every prayer written on that paper is intended for use in the prayer ceremony. As the saint, it is expected of me to memorize them, and the chief acolyte assisting me should do the same. However\u2026\u201dI gazed at the desk where dozens of prayers lay.\u201cIs there even a single prayer among those here that you can recite from beginning to end?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKarus remained speechless. There was no way he could have memorized any of them. He hung his head, his shoulders trembling, as if not even attempting to hide his frustration.\u201cI won\u2019t pretend that I am unaware of the effort you have put in thus far. Therefore, it is imperative that you acquire a level of proficiency that doesn\u2019t disappoint\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s unnecessary.\u201dSuddenly, the papers scattered in front of us. Karus had thrown them to the floor in a fit of rage. His eyes, bloodshot and sinister, stared me down. While grinding his teeth, he spoke.\u201cYou will deeply regret not choosing me as the chief acolyte, Your Holiness.\u201dAfter uttering those words, Karus promptly left without even glancing back. The priests standing at the door were startled as the door swung open, but he paid them no mind, simply marching away with heavy steps.I quietly observed his retreating figure and then lowered my head. It seemed best to tidy up the papers that had fallen to the ground before the other priests entered and made a fuss.\u201cI made a mistake by attempting to clear this up quietly.\u201dI had tried to offer Karus an appropriate reward and send him away, but it appeared that his ambition exceeded my expectations.While tidying up the papers, one caught my eye, not containing prayers.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dIt was a document regarding the security concerns of the prayer gathering. It stated that Latvan would be temporarily absent from his duty as the saint\u2019s personal guard for the day.\u201cI expected this much.\u201dNaturally, I knew that Latvan would not serve as personal guard. In fact, it would be odd if he stood by Evelina\u2019s side as if he had no other responsibilities. He had experienced humiliation, and there had been incidents during the sponsorship. I had taken the man who collided with the tree and brought him along, so I knew who he was and why he had come.Still, a feeling of disappointment washed over me.No matter how hard you try from now on, the future will not change.It felt as if someone was whispering those words.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did you sleep well, my lady?\u201d The attendant who came to wake me asked, and I responded with a wry smile, nodding my head. The expression on the attendants\u2019 faces indicated that they all knew well enough.While others may have slept soundly, I had spent the entire night with restless eyes. The clamor of the people gathered in front of the temple had reached my ears even in the early hours of the morning. When I inquired with the attendants, they informed me that many people had come from the far reaches of the continent, eagerly awaiting the prayer gathering.\u201cIt is an event that everyone wishes to attend at least once in a lifetime.\u201d\u201cI heard that many people have come, carrying young children or elderly parents nearing the end of their lives.\u201d\u201cThere is fierce competition to receive your blessing personally at the final central square.\u201dEvery day, as the attendants relayed the news, my heart grew heavier. I could increasingly sense the magnitude of this prayer gathering.\u201cPlease come this way.\u201dGuided by the attendants, I made my way to the bathroom, where dozens of people were already waiting for me. An hour later, I emerged, completely cleansed and dressed in ceremonial attire. As I saw my reflection in the mirror, transforming into an increasingly perfect image of the holy maiden, an involuntary sigh escaped my lips.Until yesterday, I had convinced myself that I would do well.\u201cUp until now, I have met only a limited number of people in restricted places\u2026\u201dLying in the hospital bed in the real world, I had never experienced anything like this before. Even with the strength drawn from Evelina\u2019s memories, the thought of standing before thousands, or even tens of thousands of people and successfully completing this performance filled me with an overwhelming tension.Unpleasant images kept flooding my mind. Suddenly, the gathering crowd would cry out, \u201cShe\u2019s a fraud!\u201d Such were the imaginations that plagued me.While I struggled to avoid the looming death two years from now, if my efforts were to change Evelina\u2019s future, could it not also worsen unexpectedly? In that case, would it be better to quietly await death?I found myself sinking deeper into these thoughts, only to snap out of it and lift my head.\u201cI must succeed.\u201dIt seemed that the impending magnitude of the task had caused my heart to become tense. Ever since I possessed this body, I had managed to carry out everything flawlessly, without any major mistakes. No one had yet discovered that I was not Evelina. With that in mind, I pressed my fingertips firmly together. Then, my gaze met the eyes of one of the attendants. She looked at my actions, nodded reassuringly, and said,\u201cDo not worry too much. Last year\u2019s gathering ended safely, so there should be no major issues this year either.\u201dIt was apparent that my nervousness was showing. Sensing that my secret had been exposed, I averted my gaze in silence. The attendant left the room momentarily and returned with a cup of tea in hand.\u201cAlthough it would be preferable for you to refrain from consuming anything, taking a warm sip may help ease your tension.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dIn truth, I had been observing a light fast for the prayer gathering since last night. I accepted the tea brought by the attendant and took a careful sip, ensuring not to smudge my makeup. A warm sensation spread through my body, and my trembling hands finally steadied.\u201cThis is only the beginning.\u201dUntil Elysia arrived at the temple and became the holy maiden, many events would transpire for Evelina. Although this prayer gathering might be the largest in scale, it was accompanied by numerous troublesome and stifling matters. Yet, there was no retreating from this position.\u201cI can do this.\u201dRepeatedly making that determination in my heart, I was about to ask, driven by curiosity when one of the attendants approached me cautiously and spoke.\u201cMy lady, if you are willing, perhaps we could make some adjustments to the schedule of the prayer gathering.\u201d\u201cAdjustments? What do you mean by changing anything?\u201dThis couldn\u2019t be happening. I had memorized and practiced the schedule of the prayer gathering for the past few days, only to be told on the morning of the event that there would be sudden changes?\u201cFor starters, we could omit the prayer of blessings to the crowd at the central square\u2026\u201dI swallowed my breath at those words. The conclusion of the prayer gathering involved the Saint proceeding to the central square and offering a prayer of blessing to the ordinary people who gathered at the temple. In fact, it was one of the most important events of this ceremony. Yet they were skipping this schedule? However, the attending priests seemed to react as if relieved by those words. I hardened my face and asked,\u201cWhat has happened?\u201dHis expression upon entering, his hushed voice while conversing with other priests, it was clear that something had indeed occurred.As I inquired, he wore a troubled expression.\u201cDo not conceal it, speak up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2026,\u201d he hesitated, then closed his eyes tightly before continuing, \u201cRumors have spread among the people who were waiting in front of the Great Temple.\u201d\u201cRumors?\u201d\u201cThe Saint\u2026 daily\u2026 with certain men\u2026 within the temple\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Goodness gracious. I touched my forehead, understanding perfectly well what kind of rumors were circulating outside.\u201cNot mere rumors.\u201dEvelina had indeed engaged in such actions. But why, of all times, did it have to be today when these rumors reached the lips of the people? Why, precisely now!\u201cAnd so, the atmosphere is rather unpleasant,\u201d he said.\u201cRather?\u201dCould it be otherwise? The priests, who would make a big fuss over the slightest omission during the ceremony, were suggesting that the most vital procedure be skipped. It meant that the external atmosphere was truly unfavorable.\u201cThis \u2018rather\u2019 implies that the most important ritual of the prayer gathering cannot be performed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is happening outside?\u201d\u201cThat..,\u201d he faltered, and I gestured to the surrounding priests to leave us alone. Once we were alone in the room, I spoke to him again.\u201cTell me what you\u2019ve heard. I have no intention of blaming you.\u201d\u201cA malicious rumor has spread among the crowd. Some individuals are attributing their own illnesses and misfortunes to the Saint\u2019s actions, claiming that she has displeased the gods\u2026 so they intend to\u2026\u201d\u201cCause harm to her.\u201d\u201cIndeed. It seems certain that the sectarians at the far end of the continent are intentionally spreading the rumor. Or perhaps it could be the sorcerers. Even if we scrutinize the individuals entering the central square, it would be difficult to prevent those who are determined to hide something. If someone were to emerge wielding a weapon and intending harm to the Saint\u2026 moreover, with the absence of the Lord Latvan this year, it is even more dangerous\u2026\u201dAs the priest spoke, he hurriedly closed his mouth. It seemed he was surprised by the name that slipped out unintentionally. It was not surprising for him to be startled since Evelina had reacted so sensitive to the mention of Latvan.\u201cBut what should we do?\u201dIf they were resorting to such extreme measures to dissuade attendance, then the atmosphere must be extremely hostile.\u201cAt this rate, Evelina is already solidifying her notorious reputation.\u201dThe incident of insulting Latvan had already spread beyond the boundaries of the temple. This prayer gathering had become the catalyst for her infamous reputation to swiftly spread throughout the entire continent.Everything before me was shrouded in darkness. Whether I attended this prayer gathering or not, would it ultimately unfold according to the contents of the book?At that moment, someone whispered inside me.\u201cWhy do you strive so fervently to alter the future?\u201dOnce, I died. The life that I have awakened to in Evelina\u2019s body is like an unexpected gift that I never anticipated.Then, wouldn\u2019t it be enough to just stay still until the end comes?If nothing will change no matter what I do, perhaps it\u2019s alright to leave things as they are. After all, there are still two years until Evelina\u2019s death. Compared to the time spent in the hospital, unable to do anything, these two years with a healthy body would be nothing short of paradise.\u201cYour Grace\u2026\u201dI lifted my head at the voice of the priest. He was waiting for my decision.If I skip the final step of stepping forward in front of the people, there wouldn\u2019t be much for me to participate in during the prayer ceremony. No, in fact, I wouldn\u2019t need to attend the prayer ceremony at all.\u201cIn the book, Evelina refused to attend the prayer ceremony, citing poor health.\u201dBecause of that, I became known as the saint who abandoned her duty throughout the entire continent. However, that didn\u2019t mean Evelina was immediately facing a threat to her life. Until Iris appears, Evelina lives as a saint within the temple. Therefore, even if I choose not to do any of this and live exactly as the novel describes, there wouldn\u2019t be any issues.So, if I simply do nothing and wait comfortably for the end. If I quietly live according to the conclusion of the book.\u201cNo, I refuse.\u201dI didn\u2019t want to live like that.If I were to live like that, I wouldn\u2019t have needed to enter this body in the first place.As someone who has died once before, I am grateful for this opportunity given to me. And I had no intention of enjoying this fortune just as much as it was given. As long as this luck, which I might lose again at any time, is in my hands, I wanted to hold onto it for as long as possible.I walked forward and opened the door. All the gazes of the people outside were fixed on me. Through their midst, I saw a long and dark corridor, with no end in sight, where I had to walk. It seemed like the future I had to move towards.Now, I have to walk that path alone. That\u2019s what I thought as I prepared to take a step forward.\u201cI bid you farewell.\u201dSuddenly, along with a familiar voice, a large hand reached out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Standing before me, adorned and impeccably dressed in resplendent white and golden attire, was Latvan. Momentarily struck by the presence of someone who had no place being here, I remained silent, simply observing him.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d I asked, my voice barely a whisper.Certainly, Latvan had declared that he would not be safeguarding the maiden at this prayer gathering. So why was he extending his hand to me?With a face devoid of expression, he inclined his head slightly and spoke.\u201cIt is my duty to protect the maiden.\u201dAt that moment, I came to understand who Latvan truly was. Despite his disdain for the maiden and the ordeals he had endured, he had returned, determined to fulfill his duty to the very end.I looked up, meeting his gaze. He was still standing there, waiting for me to take his hand. His black eyes, unwavering, betrayed no hint of hesitation. Once again, the endless corridor came into view. After gazing at it for a while, I finally placed my hand upon his outstretched palm.Perhaps, someday, this hand would be the one to end my life and that of Evelina.I slowly grasped his fingertips, feeling a warmth beneath the cold fa\u00e7ade. Smiling gently towards him, I spoke.\u201cI entrust myself to you, Sir Latvan.\u201dEven if the day came when he would kill me, it would be when we reached the end of this corridor.***With a resounding blast of trumpets, the prayer ceremony commenced.The people rushed into the grand entrance of the Daesinjeon like a torrent in the morning. The usually tranquil central square had suddenly become packed with individuals, leaving no room to move one\u2019s feet. It was no exaggeration to say that people from every nation on the continent had gathered here.There were those dressed in attire closest to the imperial fashion, as well as those clad in heavy fur garments that seemed unfit for the still cool season. On the other hand, there were individuals who appeared dressed in light clothing as if they were completely stripped.Amidst the clamor of people searching for their companions, cries filled the air. Some were already raising their voices, unable to contain their excitement.The commotion subsided only when the tolling bells announced the beginning of the first ceremony.\u201cRemarkable.\u201dThat was the only thought that crossed my mind as I observed the throngs gathered outside the closed windows.Even when I first laid eyes upon the grandeur of the Daesinjeon, I was astonished by its size, and learning the number of people who resided within it further exceeded my imagination. But now, I was astounded once again by the crowd that had filled it to the brim.Those who attended this prayer gathering did not expect to receive money or material goods from the Daesinjeon. They were individuals who had come here willingly, investing their own money with overflowing faith in the divine.\u201cTo think that all these people came here of their own accord.\u201dI had never counted such a multitude before, and I couldn\u2019t even begin to estimate their numbers. Recalling the vast crowds I had seen in the news and roughly calculating, the figure exceeded at least 100,000.\u201cMoreover, there were even more people who couldn\u2019t enter the Daesinjeon.\u201dThat meant there were tens of thousands of people who attended this prayer gathering. Soon, the choir began to sing, and their voices spread among the people like waves. The sight of everyone united in song, singing a hymn known throughout the continent, was awe-inspiring.Observing everyone with solemn faces, eyes closed, singing in unison along with the hymn, made me reconsider the position of the gods, the saints, and the Daesinjeon in this world.\u201cThe absolute faith and reverence of those living on the continent.\u201dThat was the prevailing sentiment among the people of the continent towards the saint. They might question why anyone would believe in gods that provided no practical help in their own lives, but at least in this world, the power of the gods was undoubtedly manifested.\u201cIt is said that demons appear in the lands of heretics.\u201dIn the lands of those who do not serve the gods, demons constantly emerge. Although they also appear in the lands of the faithful, the difference in numbers is staggering, and each time, the Divine Knights venture there to vanquish the demons.\u201cIt is said that the swords of the knights are blessed by the divine clergy, as the demons despise divine power.\u201dI recalled the manifestation of divine power I witnessed when the secret passage was opened. Such a tangible display of unquestionable divine power made faith in the gods an absolute necessity in this world. Moreover, since that power was directly related to their lives, it became even more imperative.Evelina, in particular, struck me as truly remarkable.People tend to conform to the expectations of those around them. I, too, had lived my life in such a manner.\u201cWhen I see how well-behaved you are, unlike other children, enduring such a long hospitalization without throwing tantrums, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen that.\u201dWhen the doctor who attended to me praised me in this way, my parents smiled faintly, as if filled with pride. From that moment on, until the moment of my death, I never once threw a tantrum. It was to ensure that I did not deviate from their expectations.It wasn\u2019t something I disliked or found difficult. If behaving in such a manner would make those around me cherish and love me more, and make them feel proud of me, I willingly chose to do so. After all, there was nothing wrong with wanting to appear better to those who loved me.\u201cBut why Evelina?\u201dI was also afraid of straying from the expectations of the few individuals who held them for me. However, Evelina disregarded the expectations of so many people, or rather, she turned her back on the expectations of an entire continent. Even when she witnessed the disappointment and anger that arose from conflicting expectations, she did not change her attitude. No, she became even more twisted.In a way, it seemed remarkably brave. If I were to imagine that the people gathered over there were all cursing and blaming me, it would send shivers down my spine.While I was lost in my thoughts, I heard the sound of two knocks on the door from outside. In response to the sound, Lathba, who was in the room with me, opened the door. The divine clergy waiting outside bowed their heads and spoke.\u201cThe final ceremony of the day is about to commence.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dAt last, the moment had arrived. The faces of the officials betrayed a palpable tension.\u201cUntil now, everything has been fine,\u201d one of them remarked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Among them, the protective barrier, which shielded oneself from external attacks, was the most fundamental manifestation of this power. If there were to be an assault, the saint, armed with her own power, would render weapons such as swords or bows futile in their attempts to harm her.\u201cBut that was a tale from when I truly was Evelina,\u201d she pondered aloud.Oddly enough, there were no memories in Evelina\u2019s recollection regarding the use of her power. Thus, besides the power that automatically manifested, she still remained unable to utilize any other force. If someone were to attack her now, she would be defenseless.\u201cFortunately, the people are oblivious, so there should be no attacks,\u201d she sighed with relief.Her decision to attend the final ceremony was predicated on that belief.\u201cI will proceed,\u201d Latvan declared.The officials received his words, and he returned to my side, extending his hand once again. Some of the officials couldn\u2019t conceal their astonishment at Latvan\u2019s actions. It was an expression that conveyed admiration for Latvan, who remained dedicated to fulfilling his duty even after enduring such humiliation.Sensing Latvan\u2019s warmth as his hand touched mine again, I instinctively took a half-step back.\u201cIt would be best to keep some distance,\u201d I suggested.Upon hearing my words, Latvan briefly glanced at me.\u201cShould I step back a little more?\u201d he queried.In that moment, as I considered taking a further step back, he took hold of my hand and pulled me towards him. Consequently, I found myself unable to increase the distance between us, and we walked side by side.***\u201cOh, holy maiden! Oh, holy maiden! Please bestow upon us your divine blessing!\u201d\u201cIt took me two whole months to come here! I\u2019ve been waiting for this Sunday in front of the temple, barely able to make my way forward. Please, offer a prayer of blessing for my child!\u201dAs we descended to the central square, the cries of the people resounded in my ears like thunder. Despite the knights and guards desperately trying to hold them back, it seemed futile to stop the overwhelming crowd that approached with an eerie intensity as soon as they caught sight of the holy maiden.In such a situation, Latvan ordered the knights surrounding me to reinforce the security. Promptly, the knights, who had seemed fatigued just moments ago, responded with vigor and successfully held off the approaching throng with unwavering tension. Thanks to them, a narrow path was created, allowing us to pass.As we began to walk along this path, the people reached out their hands through the gaps between the knights, once again shouting their prayers for blessings. As I hesitated upon seeing those hands, a priest who had been walking ahead approached and whispered quietly.\u201cIf you wish, we can prepare for you to walk through as we did last year. For them, merely catching a glimpse of the holy maiden is considered the greatest honor in life\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dIt was not that I didn\u2019t want to reach out. On the contrary, I was contemplating how I could reach as many people as possible.Among the people reaching out their hands toward me, many were afflicted with severe illnesses. The sacred power could heal wounds and toxins, but it could only temporarily improve the condition of an illness and never completely cure it. Especially those illnesses that come with old age. It was said that one could not resist what nature inevitably brought forth according to the divine order. Yet, despite knowing this fact, people still clung to hope.Memories of my sister, who had been in the hospital bed next to me, came to mind.\u201cMy illness cannot be cured.\u201dNonchalantly, my sister sent a mail to the radio show she always listened to. Perhaps she had been unlucky. She sent dozens of emails, yet her story never came through. But then, finally, her story was introduced. At that moment, my usually listless sister listened to the radio with sparkling eyes and a face flushed with excitement.\u201cYou\u2019re currently undergoing treatment. Someday, you\u2019ll be able to overcome it all and stand up.\u201dLooking back now, it wasn\u2019t particularly remarkable. However, my sister kept replaying the recorded voice of the DJ over and over again. Even until the moment she entered the intensive care unit, she wore a smile.That radio show couldn\u2019t cure her illness, but it gave her hope and a sense of peace.I lifted my head. I could see hands reaching out to me.\u201cIf I can bring them that kind of serenity, even if I\u2019m not a true holy maiden.\u201dThen I can grasp it, no matter what. Thinking that way, as I approached, the line suddenly collapsed, and someone fell to the ground, causing my hood to slip off. The people nearby let out short screams and stepped back as they saw the face of an elderly man, his face lined with countless unknown sores. The old man looked at me and prostrated himself.\u201cOh, holy maiden! Please offer a prayer of blessing for me!\u201dLooking at the old man, I turned to Latvan and spoke.\u201cCommander Latvan, could you bring that person to me?\u201dJudging from the situation, if I were to approach him directly, more people would crowd around, causing a disturbance. Latvan, realizing that there was no one else suitable to call, turned his body.And then\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It wasn\u2019t a tremendous pain that would make me immediately clutch my face, but rather a dull ache. A viscous liquid trickled down from my hair. Simultaneously, I caught a whiff of a repulsive odor.I didn\u2019t need to ponder for long to know what it was. A broken eggshell lay crushed beneath my feet. Judging by the foul smell, it seemed to be a rotten egg.Before I could fully comprehend what was happening, another cry reached my ears.\u201cI know all about how you spend your nights with men in the temple!\u201dOnce again, something flew amidst the crowd. This time, I had a hunch that it wouldn\u2019t be an egg. Without even realizing it, I momentarily closed my eyes, and a crimson blur covered my vision. Then, a warm sensation enveloped me. In the distance, I heard a thud, a muffled sound.\u201cCapture her.\u201dLatvan\u2019s voice resounded above me. His low voice sent shivers down my spine. In an instant, I understood the situation. Latvan had wrapped his cloak around me and pulled me close. With my arms restrained by his cloak, I couldn\u2019t see what was happening outside. But I could hear the knights\u2019 shouts and the brief screams of people. Subsequently, rough voices commanding them to let go followed suit.\u201cThey say she\u2019s bedded the temple priests in her sacred sanctuary every night!\u201dIt was the voice of the person who had thrown the egg. My body stiffened at his words. I couldn\u2019t refute them. It was true that Evelina had engaged in such activities, if not every night, at least occasionally.\u201cSilence!\u201dLatvan spoke again, and with a thud!, the voice of the man who was hurling insults ceased. Instead, the voices of the people around me echoed.\u201cSo, the rumors were true?\u201d\u201cI heard whispers of it as well. Apparently, there are many men selling the relics given by the saint.\u201d\u201cI heard it\u2019s not even a big secret within the temple. The priests themselves openly talk about it!\u201dA murmur turned into a loud uproar. In the blink of an eye, the atmosphere of the people shifted so swiftly that the cries and curses directed towards me, which had been filled with blessings just moments ago, seemed like lies.The man no longer needed to shout. Instead, the voices of the people began to rise.\u201cIt would be wise to go inside.\u201dLatvan lowered his head and spoke to me, concealed beneath his cloak. I couldn\u2019t muster a response.I was afraid. If I looked outside now, I would be greeted by the gazes of contempt and disgust that I would have to endure as long as I lived in Evelina.\u201cFilthy harlot! How long will you hide behind the knights of the temple? Knights! You need to know! My relative\u2026\u201dThis time, was it Latvan who moved? After he pulled me close, the body that held me trembled, and there was a thud. The voice of the man who had called me a harlot ceased.\u201cI apologize.\u201dLatvan seemed to have no intention of waiting for any further response. As he led me forward, I reached out and grabbed his arm.\u201cWait.\u201dAs I responded, he halted his movements. I removed the cloak that covered me. As I did, rotten eggs plopped down from my hair. Was I under the illusion that by revealing myself, I would be able to enter the temple as planned? The people who had been joyfully cheering moments ago suddenly fell silent upon seeing me.Now, no matter what I said, I knew I couldn\u2019t quell this rumor.\u201cRegardless of what I do, the story progresses like a novel.\u201dUnlike in the novel, even if Evelina had attended as planned, the prayer meeting would have become the catalyst for spreading vile rumors about the saint across the entire continent.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201dI turned away, leaving behind the disdainful gazes. In that place, forgotten for a moment by everyone, an old man had fallen. Amidst the gathered crowd, he was the only one still seated, refusing to move.\u201cAre you still seeking my blessing?\u201dI queried the old man, and he nodded in response. Approaching him, I raised my hand above his head. Though I could see the repulsive odor and grotesquely contorted skin, having witnessed even more dreadful sights during my time in the hospital, it did not greatly astonish me.\u201cIn the most challenging moments, in the happiest moments, may the Lord always be with you. He will be by your side whenever you desire.\u201dThere are numerous words of blessing. Even though I had memorized dozens of phrases for this ceremony, only this one would be used. I bowed my head and pressed my lips against the old man\u2019s head.Just as a trivial radio broadcast became someone\u2019s solace, I hoped that even this artificial nun\u2019s blessing would provide strength to the old man. It was then that the old man lifted his head and looked at me.\u201cThank you, Sister.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIn that instant, I could tell.\u201cHe\u2019s not an old man!\u201dThe azure eyes gazing at me were as clear as they were intimidating. Moreover, there was no sign of illness-induced weakness or fatigue anywhere. Instead, his eyes sparkled with amusement and curiosity, as if he had found something intriguing.As I tried to rise in surprise, he reached out his hand. Then, he grabbed my hair cascading down my shoulders. His grip, though not rough, exerted a strong force, leaving me unable to stand up, but compelled to continue gazing at him.He slowly brought the strand of hair he had captured to his mouth. After gently touching his lips to it, he looked at me and spoke.\u201cI will eagerly await the day when I see you again, Sister.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The officials sighed with darkened faces, as their fears had inevitably materialized. Even without making an effort to listen, their voices reached my ears clearly beneath the thicket of bushes.\u201cI knew this would explode in such a manner!\u201d\u201cNow those scandalous rumors will spread across the continent within a month.\u201d\u201cPeople will be cursing at the temple! What a disgrace!\u201dThe voices of the officials grew increasingly louder. Then someone spoke up.\u201cWhy on earth must we endure such troubles? It\u2019s all because of the saint, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cYes, indeed. We thought she would come to her senses after causing all sorts of problems and then collapsing\u2026 but we were completely mistaken.\u201dAfter ranting for quite a while, they seemed exhausted even from slandering Evelina, whispering with hushed voices.\u201cBeing called the temple\u2019s prostitute\u2026 Now, I don\u2019t even know anymore. I suppose I should go and finish preparing for the remaining prayer gathering tomorrow.\u201dWith that, the officials engaged in conversation and soon departed, leaving the sanctuary once again in silence.Confirming that there were no signs of anyone approaching, I rose from my position and lay down on a bench. Damp strands of hair fell beneath the bench. I reached out and held them close to my nose, where a rich floral scent wafted. Despite the fact that the smell of rotten eggs should no longer linger, there was something about the scent I caught during the final ritual that made my nose tingle.\u201cI\u2019m tired\u2026\u201dUnintentionally, I found myself murmuring those words. There had been too much happening within a single day. I couldn\u2019t sleep deeply since the previous night and had been active since dawn. In addition, the prayer gathering\u2019s ceremonies continued throughout the day. However, above all, what had exhausted me was undoubtedly the incident during the final ritual.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect Latvan to kneel again.\u201dUpon returning to my room, he immediately dropped to one knee before me, lowering his head.\u201cI failed in my duty. Please hold me accountable.\u201dHis words made me realize why he suddenly knelt. Latvan was the one responsible for my protection today. Yet, I ended up being hit by the eggs thrown by the people, despite his presence.\u201cIt\u2019s not your responsibility, Sir Latvan. It\u2019s my fault for giving you a different task.\u201dIf I hadn\u2019t asked Latvan to bring an old man to me, he would have easily deflected the eggs. As I thought about this, I stood up and spoke, but he did not move.\u201cFor whatever reason, it is my responsibility that you were harmed, Saint. No one will be able to make me change my mind about that, unless someone questions me.\u201dHis demeanor was resolute. It seemed he would not rise unless someone held him accountable.\u201cI understand. I will inquire about your responsibility for my injuries, Sir Latvan. However, not now. Please continue your duties without any changes until the prayer gathering concludes tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an order. Step back now.\u201dAs I mentioned the word \u201corder,\u201d he reluctantly stepped back.\u201cNow, what should I do\u2026\u201dI murmured while gazing at the night sky, but no particularly good ideas came to mind. I tried to find the mildest punishment possible within Evelina\u2019s memories, but all that came to mind were cruel ones, one after another.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dFor now, I realized that I needed to think more carefully about Latvan\u2019s punishment. That issue seemed to occupy my mind even more than, or perhaps beyond, any other lingering questions.\u201cWho is that man?\u201dThe man who pretended to be an old man and asked for my blessings.\u201cWhat on earth was his purpose?\u201dI grasped my hair once again, contemplating the spot where the man had kissed me, but no particular thoughts arose.\u201cI shall await the day we meet again\u2026\u201dHis voice carried a resolute strength. It was an instinctive understanding on my part. The man undoubtedly harbored intentions of reuniting with me.While curious about his true identity, I held no concerns. Through the gaze directed at me, the man appeared content, devoid of any hostility.\u201cIf danger lurks, those who stood by his side would be in greater peril.\u201dSuddenly, a pang of emotion welled up within me as I recollected their words.\u201cWhy is Evelina considered a harlot?\u201dIf she were indeed a harlot, she would have exchanged her body for money. However, wasn\u2019t Evelina the exact opposite? She embraced the men who sought her, returning their wealth and valuables. Of course, her actions were not commendable, but unjustness clung to the air.\u201cI must also prepare for tomorrow\u2019s prayer meeting\u2026\u201dHaving cleansed myself, I lay beneath the refreshing night breeze, and my eyelids naturally grew heavy. Although I needed to return to my room through the secret passage, my exhausted body refused to comply.\u201cJust a while longer, then let us depart.\u201dWith that thought, I swiftly succumbed to sleep.And when I opened my eyes once more, I found myself atop my bed in my own room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

How did I return?\u201dNow, as I gazed at the familiar ceiling painting, I blinked my eyes. No matter how many times I blinked, it remained unchanged, indicating that I was not seeing things in vain.\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything.\u201dClearly, my last memory was falling asleep on the bench, feeling the cool breeze. But when and how exactly did I return to my room? Slowly, I rose from the bed and examined my body. I was still wearing the same clothes, covered by the same blanket. As I ran my fingers over the blanket, I unintentionally murmured to myself.\u201cSomething feels different.\u201dIn that moment of drowsiness, I vaguely remembered holding onto something. It was soft and warm, and I didn\u2019t want to let go of it. I wondered if it was the blanket, but the rough texture felt entirely different from the sensation in my memories.\u201cWhat was it that I held onto?\u201dWhile pondering this, I heard a knocking sound at the door, accompanied by the voices of the palace guards announcing their presence.\u201cMay I come in?\u201d\u201cPlease come in.\u201dAs I replied, the door opened and they entered.\u201cI apologize for not knowing you had awakened.\u201dThey seemed surprised and bowed their heads in response to my groggy appearance.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. But more importantly, what time is it now?\u201d\u201cLady, the ceremony you are attending won\u2019t take place until much later. You can take your time getting ready.\u201dIn their words, a memory came back to me. Thankfully, the ceremony I had to attend was scheduled for the afternoon on the second day of the prayer meeting.\u201cYou look much better today than yesterday. It seems you slept well last night.\u201dOh, is that so?Upon hearing those words, I realized that I indeed felt somewhat better. When I lay on the bench, my body had been aching all over, but now, even when stretching, there was no particular pain.\u201cNo one would have used healing powers on me, saint.\u201dIn truth, it would be futile for other palace guards to use their healing powers on me, saint. Perhaps, if they exerted quite strong powers, there might be a slight improvement, but who would bother with such meaningless actions? Lost in such thoughts, I recollected how I had returned to bed, groping for memories.\u201cWho brought me back to my room last night?\u201d\u201cWhat? Last night?\u201d\u201cI distinctly remember falling asleep outside\u2026\u201d\u201cThat couldn\u2019t be. Lady, you haven\u2019t left since you fell asleep yesterday\u2026\u201dAs the palace guard spoke, their voices grew faint. Their expression seemed to ask whether I had gone out and met someone. In response to that look on their face, I quickly lifted my head.\u201cNo, I must have dreamed it. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAs I said that, the palace guard\u2019s face became slightly suspicious. However, other guards who followed them entered and urged them to focus on preparing for today\u2019s ceremony. They wiped away their expression and followed the others to the adjacent room.[Phew]Breathing a sigh of relief, I looked at the bed. It seemed that no one had brought me back. After all, the palace guards who stood guard outside the room all day would have known if someone had taken me out. If no one knew that I had left, then undoubtedly, I had returned through the secret passage inside.\u201cSomehow, I managed to come back on my own.\u201dI didn\u2019t think anyone else knew about the existence of the secret passage. Moreover, it seemed that only I could open the door leading to the passage.\u201cFor now, let\u2019s focus on today\u2019s tasks.\u201dWith that thought in mind, I lightly tapped my cheek. Still, the lingering sensation in my hand did not easily disappear.***The impending participation in the event did not allow for leisurely rest in the afternoon. After adorning myself in formal attire, I promptly headed to the office with the officials. It was a place I had visited two or three times since inhabiting this body. However, the moment I opened the door and took a step inside, I halted in my tracks, for it bore little resemblance to my memory.\u201cWhat on earth is this?\u201dI couldn\u2019t discern whether it was an office or a warehouse. When I last visited, it was a well-organized, spacious room, but now it was filled to the ceiling with piled-up objects. These objects, though referred to as \u201cbelongings,\u201d were not mere luggage. They were ornate boxes, adorned with splendid decorations, clearly indicating their value, stacked upon desks and the floor.As I stood motionless amidst the cluttered objects, the officials who had followed me inside began to explain.\u201cOfferings for the prayer ceremony have been sent from numerous countries, even more grandly than last year. After the ceremony, there will be a time for each country\u2019s diplomats to present their respects. Please have a look around.\u201dIt was only then that I understood the purpose of this place. It had been lightly touched upon in the novel as well\u2014the offerings for the prayer ceremony.It was an ancient tradition.Thanks to the presence of the Saintess, this continent could enjoy a certain level of safety from the forces of darkness. However, not every place was secure. The farther one moved away from the central temple, the more vulnerable the land became to the threat of the dark forces. To ensure people\u2019s safety from these malevolent beings, the central temple dispatched the Order of Temple Knights or high-ranking officials to those areas. Occasionally, even the Saintess herself would go.The countries that sent offerings to the central temple in gratitude for the assistance during the prayer ceremony\u2014a gesture of appreciation. Those were the offerings for the prayer ceremony.Over time, it had become a tradition throughout the continent that whenever the prayer ceremony took place, every country would send offerings to the central temple as a matter of course.These offerings were broadly divided into two categories.Firstly, there were offerings for the crowds gathered outside, akin to clouds. These offerings mainly consisted of provisions distributed to the people staying here for two days. They were not limited to food but included herbs and fruits as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Fake Saintess Awaits Her ExitCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe other offerings were dedicated to the central temple\u2019s proprietor, Saintess.\u201cMany have been sent indeed.\u201dAmong them were countries that sent an exceptional number of offerings. It seemed that the more remote the country, which had to rely on the central temple\u2019s assistance, the greater the amount of offerings it sent. It was a way of requesting the dispatch of the Order of Temple Knights or high-ranking officials to their respective countries.\u201cI heard that they didn\u2019t send this much\u2026\u201dThe novel mentioned that the quantity of offerings had multiplied several times after Evelina became the Saintess. The reason was her sending of the Order of Temple Knights and officials to the countries that sent more and more valuable offerings.Initially, I wondered if the Saintess would discriminate among the countries based on the quantity of offerings, but as time went by, it became clear that sending offerings had turned into a competitive endeavor.\u201cAnd this is the result.\u201dAfter exhaling a short sigh, I picked up a small wooden box nearby. Attached to the box was a paper with the word \u201cLaurus\u201d written on it. Upon recollecting my memory, I remembered that Laurus was a small country quite distant from the central temple. I wondered what they had sent here.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dConsidering it was a small box, I casually opened it. Inside, a brilliantly sparkling red gem, about the size of a child\u2019s fist, caught my eye. Despite my lack of knowledge in this field, I instinctively knew.\u201cIt must be extremely valuable!\u201dCarefully, I put it down with trembling hands and then laid my eyes upon a slightly larger box. Made of solid, fragrant black wood, it was exquisitely adorned with delicate carvings. Even before opening it, I could sense that what lay inside was even more extraordinary than the gem I had just seen.With that thought in mind, I opened the lid of the wooden box and was left speechless, blinking my eyes.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dNothing came out of my mouth but a simple exclamation of awe. Were those diamonds? Inside were necklaces and earrings, a set embedded with hundreds of transparent jewels. They reminded me of artifacts from a distant museum that I had seen in a book.After closing the box, I quickly moved on to the next ones. Inside every box were jewels and ornaments\u2014sometimes even gold ingots and coins.\u201cThis is not merely a jewellery store\u2026\u201dRather than offering treasures adorned with biblical inscriptions, or framing elaborate ill**trations depicting the exploits of past saints, these dedicatory offerings were all, without exception, meant for one purpose\u2026\u201cFor personal use,\u201d the clergyman standing nearby, his gaze transfixed upon the boxes I opened, murmured, bowing his head.\u201cThis year, it seems you have taken great care in fulfilling the words of the saint,\u201d he added.\u201cAs I instructed?\u201dHis words stirred a sudden recollection of Evelina.\u201cGoodness gracious.\u201dThe memories of last year\u2019s prayer meeting flooded back to me. In those memories, Evelina had flung offerings brimming with devout faith out the window. The object she cast into the depths was a tapestry crafted in the fashion of the region\u2019s inhabitants, adorned with biblical verses, a creation born of unwavering faith, crafted diligently amid the hardships of a place where daily sustenance was scarce and the threat of malevolent forces lurked.\u201cWho in the world would send such rubbish as an offering?\u201dUttering those words, Evelina cast the offering into the pond beyond the window. And to the land that sent it, no knight or clergyman extended their gratitude.That land was Laurus.The country from which I received the first opened box.No wonder my mouth felt as though I had chewed on sand. Laurus had suffered great losses in the past year, besieged by frequent attacks from malevolent forces. Hence, this year\u2026\u201cThese were sent as pleas for salvation.\u201dI closed the box with a bittersweet feeling, different from before, and pushed it aside. How should I handle these offerings? Once the prayer meeting concluded, it seemed I would need to meet the envoy sent by Laurus and promptly dispatch knights and clergymen.\u201cAnd return those offerings as well.\u201dLaurus was a far-from-prosperous country. How difficult must it have been for them to prepare such offerings? As I silently reproached Evelina in my heart, I moved forward.\u201cThis is\u2026\u201dThen, I noticed a towering pile of offerings, seemingly accumulated as children\u2019s playthings, sent by Laurus just moments ago.\u201cWhere could this be?\u201dSurveying my surroundings, it became apparent that this land had sent the most offerings. Recalling the names of the powerful nations on the continent, I picked up the box that lay closest and harbored a sense of suspicion.\u201cThis can\u2019t be true.\u201dIt had been clearly written in the book. All had sent offerings, except for the Empire of Appelius, which had refrained from sending an offering to the saint.Yet, affixed to the box I now held in my hands was a slip of paper bearing the words \u201cEmpire of Appelius.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instead, they sent offerings for the attendees of the prayer ceremony, surpassing any other nation in both quantity and quality. Consequently, people praised the Empire, or more precisely, the current ruler, Prince Leon, who effectively governed the Empire.\u201cOf course, Evelina was furious,\u201dTherefore, I remember that after the prayer ceremony, they did not meet the Empire\u2019s envoy. The Empire\u2019s delegation relayed the facts they had witnessed to Prince Leon, which only intensified his disgust toward Evelina.Even without that incident, the relationship between the Empire and the Temple was incredibly delicate.The Appelius Empire had rapidly grown in power several decades ago, shortly after the current emperor ascended the throne. Back then, it wasn\u2019t even known as an empire. The name was acquired through the emperor\u2019s victorious conquests in the preceding war.The expanding Empire had gradually absorbed numerous neighboring countries surrounding the Temple within a span of a dozen years or so. As a result, the once bordering nations around the Temple had all become part of the Empire\u2019s territory.To the Empire, the Temple was a thorn in its side. If it were up to them, they would have marched their army straight into the Temple and wiped it out. However, the Temple, being revered and worshipped by not only all the nations on the continent but also by the people, couldn\u2019t be invaded like any other country.Meanwhile, the current emperor weakened, and his son, Prince Leon, assumed practical control over the Empire. The emperor had repeatedly told Leon,\u201cNo matter what happens, you must bring the Temple to its knees beneath the Empire\u2019s feet.\u201dThe prince, who held his father in high esteem, vowed to fulfill his wish with utmost dedication. Therefore, he developed a deep interest in the Temple\u2019s affairs.\u201cThen, rumors about Iris spread, and he approached her with the intention of using her to bring Evelina down, only to fall in love.\u201d.In the book, when the prince suffered an ambush and got injured, it was through Iris\u2019 care that they first met. Unaware of his royal status, Iris treated him kindly, taking care of him until he recovered. Even after he healed, the prince never left Iris\u2019 side. It was truly a textbook romance.Regardless, it was around that time when Prince Leon began to take real action.\u201cIt will take a year for me to leave the Empire and take action,\u201d he revealed.He is not someone you can meet as easily as Latvan just because you want to.\u201cIt seems difficult to even become acquainted,\u201dRather than becoming acquainted, it would be fortunate if they could meet without drawing their swords in the current confrontational situation between the Temple and the Empire.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dI shifted my gaze back to the offerings. Not a single item sent by the Empire was unimpressive. Moreover, their variety was remarkable. There were items exclusively for the saint, as well as sculptures and paintings that could be placed in the Temple.\u201cThis wasn\u2019t part of the novel\u2019s plot,\u201d I wondered.Surely, the Empire didn\u2019t send anything to Evelina. That\u2019s how it should have been.As I surveyed the accumulated offerings, a heavy feeling weighed upon my chest. The prayer ceremony, as well as these offerings\u2026\u201cWhy is it different from the book?\u201dIf that\u2019s the case, the entire narrative would veer off course. Although the circumstances may differ, ultimately the novel would follow its original flow.Frowning at the Empire\u2019s offerings, the attendant spoke up.\u201cThe Empire\u2019s envoy is already causing a commotion, stating they must meet the saint once the prayer ceremony ends. Although in the past, you had refused any audience with the Empire\u2019s delegation, it seems this time they must be received\u2026\u201d\u201cUnderstood,\u201d I replied.\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cAs the first person to meet the Empire\u2019s envoy, please make the necessary preparations,\u201d she instructed.After saying that, I lowered my hand.\u201cAnd until I summon them, no one should enter this place.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter the officials had departed, they carefully inspected the offerings. All were splendid jewels and adornments intended solely for the holy maiden\u2019s personal delight. One might surmise that Evelina was consumed by greed, demanding such luxurious goods from every nation. However, I know better. In truth, Evelina had little interest in such trinkets.Her drawer was filled with countless jewels, treated as though they were trivial refuse. She never bothered to adorn herself with them, occasionally bestowing them upon the men she entertained at night, clutching them like toys as they were caught in her grasp.\u201cThey were never meant for such purposes, I dare say.\u201dIf anything, gold coins would have been more practical. But why Evelina desired these items remained an enigma, a memory veiled from my sight.\u201cWhatever her intentions may have been, they must be returned.\u201dAccepting these gifts from all the kingdoms would only amplify the animosity towards Evelina, a consequence not to be taken lightly. No, they were probably already showering her with harsh words.As I spent a considerable time sorting the items to be returned, I grew weary and took a seat.\u201cThere are also many letters.\u201dGlancing at the desk, I noticed an array of missives sent by various diplomatic envoys. After the prayer session, I would have to reply to each one in the audience hall.\u201cThe position of the holy maiden entails more tasks than I had imagined.\u201dWhen I first possessed this body, I thought merely offering prayers would suffice. Now, it feels as if I\u2019m incessantly burdened with work day and night.As I read through the letters one by one, I stumbled upon something peculiar at the very bottom.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dAmong the ornately decorated letters on the desk, there was a thin, white envelope with nothing written on it.\u201cPerhaps it was mistakenly included?\u201dNo nation would be so careless as to send a letter to the holy maiden with such a lack of attention to detail. Perhaps it belonged to some covert underground transaction rather than the temple. Intrigued, I decided to inspect its contents. Though it seemed thin at first glance, there was only one sheet of paper inside. Curiously, the outside of the envelope bore no indication of the sender or recipient.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There, only one sentence was written.\u201cThe deal has been struck. There is no turning back. I shall find you soon.\u201d\u201cA deal?\u201dIt must be another misplaced letter, but even so, it seemed unlikely for anyone within the temple to send or receive such correspondence. This letter seemed more suited for a clandestine underground transaction. As I examined the paper between my fingers, I felt a sharp sting.\u201cOuch.\u201dI had slightly cut my finger on the paper. Who would have thought that being cut by paper could be so painful? It was a regrettable mistake. I placed the letter back into the envelope and set it on the desk.\u201cWhy on earth would something like this be here?\u201dAnd then it happened.The letter I had just put down began to burn as if it were in flames. In an instant, the blazing letter diminished in size on the desk until\u2026\u201cIt vanished?\u201dI could hardly believe what I had witnessed. Not only had the letter caught fire inexplicably, but there was no trace of ashes or remnants left on the desk. It was as if the letter I had been looking at just moments ago had never existed.\u201cThis can\u2019t be possible\u2026\u201dIt was no illusion. It was undoubtedly there!As thoughts reached the point of questioning my sanity, a sharp pang of pain tingled at the tip of my finger.\u201cAh.\u201dThere was evidence. The wound on my finger, caused by the paper in the envelope that I had shaken and sliced. Clearly, that letter was not a figment of my imagination.\u201cWell then, how did this happen?\u201dThere is only one force in this world that makes such things possible. It is none other than magic.While the divine officials who wield celestial powers are revered and loved everywhere, the sorcerers who use magic are despised and hated across the continent. It was no small matter. The magic they employ is the very essence from which demons derive their power. Thus, despite its incredible strength and versatility, people feared sorcerers.\u201cUsing magic leads to becoming a demon.\u201dThere was not a soul on the continent who did not know these words. Therefore, how could any sorcerer be welcomed among the people? They were no different from demons pretending to be human.However, there were many who desired their formidable magic. That is why, despite officially being antagonistic forces, there were many who sought out sorcerers. Especially in countries at war, it was said that the presence of a few sorcerers could determine the outcome.Thus, the sorcerers existed in this world, but they pretended not to be seen.\u201cBut to use magic and put something like this inside the temple?\u201dAnd to saint Evelina?\u201cWho on earth could it be?\u201dHardly any sorcerer could approach the vicinity of the temple, let alone send a letter inside with such mastery of magic without appearing in person.\u201cCould it be?\u201dThe image of the third male protagonist from the book came to mind.The king of sorcerers, Aslan.He lived on an island of sorcerers, a month\u2019s journey by boat from the northern end of the continent. Due to the persecution he faced on the continent, unless he had a special purpose, sorcerers mostly gathered there to study and develop their powers. According to the descriptions in the book, it was said that even demons could hardly venture into that tumultuous land.In the book, his first departure from the island of sorcerers was due to Iris. When Iris appeared and Evelina\u2019s celestial power shifted in that direction, he became intrigued by the immense flow of power and left the island to meet Iris.\u201cAnd Aslan ended up helping Iris.\u201dHe didn\u2019t have many appearances until what I saw, but I remembered that he had spoken dangerous words every time. Though he was almost like a demon himself with his use of powerful magic, he seemed to become a gentle lamb in the face of Iris\u2019 overwhelming celestial power. His demeanor still seemed rough, though.\u201cBut it will be a long time before Aslan makes an appearance.\u201dThere is no reason for someone who will not leave the island of sorcerers until a year later to send a letter to me, no, to Evelina.\u201cMoreover\u2026\u201dThe letter stated that he would agree to a transaction. What could Evelina propose to him as part of the deal?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Only when the concerned officials knocked on my door and urged me to come out did I manage to gather my wits and step outside. The individuals who had been waiting for me quickly dressed me in a finely tailored attire.Even as I made these preparations, my mind was still preoccupied with the missing letter. The words that promised to return lingered in my thoughts.\u201cWhat kind of deal was it? And when will they come?\u201dThe contents of the letter kept plaguing my mind.\u201cMadam, are you alright?\u201dHad I been lost in thought for too long? A minister who had been explaining something to me called out.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, what did you say?\u201d\u201cI mentioned that it might be best to omit the final ceremony of today\u2019s prayer meeting.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dI nodded in agreement to the minister\u2019s words. The ceremony that had caused such an uproar yesterday, despite being the crucial part of the prayer meeting, the ritual of blessings. Although it didn\u2019t involve the use of holy powers, it attracted a large crowd.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing more we can do.\u201dIn my heart, I still desired to proceed today. However, I doubted anyone would still seek the Lady\u2019s blessing. I learned from eavesdropping on the ministers\u2019 conversation yesterday that rumors spread even faster after the event turned chaotic. Furthermore, it seemed that Evelina had been actively enticing men before the prayer meeting even began.\u201cIsn\u2019t it only right that we abstain from such activities before the prayer meeting?\u201dThe anger that had flared up at the mention of courtesans had now shifted to resentment towards Evelina. While I had tried to empathize with her given that I inhabited her body, the fact remained that a villain is a villain. Not even a shred of sympathy arose in me, especially when I recalled the offerings in the study.\u201cHa.\u201dWhy did I end up in Evelina\u2019s body and face such circumstances? As I pondered this, I covered my mouth with my hand.\u201cGoodness.\u201dNot long ago, I had been grateful for the fortunate opportunity to live in a healthy body.\u201cI have lost my mind.\u201dInstead of expressing gratitude for the given fortune, I was now searching for something better as if it had been mine from the start. While berating myself for such selfish thoughts, I stood there, and the door opened, revealing a familiar person.\u201cCommander of the Temple Knights, Latvan, greetings to the Lady.\u201d\u201cI entrust today to you as well, Latvan.\u201dBefore Latvan could say anything more, I intentionally exerted force and wished him well for the day. Otherwise, he would surely mention yesterday\u2019s events and request further punishment. My gaze, fixed upon Latvan, stopped at his cloak.\u201cIt seems your cloak has changed.\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dYesterday, he had been wearing a cloak with red lining. However, today, it was a similar shade of red but different from the previous cloak.\u201cIt must be the color for ordinary knights.\u201dUpon closer inspection, it also appeared slightly smaller. It was clear that this cloak was not his own. I recalled how he had covered me with the cloak after I endured the rotten egg baptism.\u201cIt was because of me.\u201d\u201cI apologize, Sir Latvan. It was my fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhether or not it was the right thing to say, Latvan turned his face without uttering a word, as an act of courtesy. Then, in a slightly subdued voice compared to his greeting earlier, he replied.\u201cYou needn\u2019t worry about it.\u201dAs if there were any chance not to worry. At first glance, it might not be noticeable, but upon closer inspection, it was evident that the cloak didn\u2019t suit him.\u201cRest assured. There won\u2019t be any ceremonies today where you have to meet people directly, as was the case yesterday. So, your cloak won\u2019t get dirty again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn an attempt to lighten the stiff atmosphere, I added a touch of laughter to my words. However, Latvan\u2019s face grew even sterner.\u201cI should refrain from such unnecessary remarks.\u201dAs I approached, I sensed that Latvan was avoiding me more and more. Why was that, I wondered, until I caught sight of the expressions on the faces of the attendants standing beside me. They wore expressions that seemed to convey their weariness towards me.\u201cIncredible.\u201dWhy had I forgotten about what had happened between him and Evelina?\u201cIt\u2019s nothing short of a miracle that he is here right now.\u201dYesterday, I had felt a sense of familiarity as if he were an old friend, all because of the favor he had bestowed upon me. It wasn\u2019t as if Latvan didn\u2019t feel the same way just because I had no connection with him.Upon realizing this, a wave of embarrassment washed over me. While trying to soothe my flushed face with a fan in my hand, one of the attendants I had seen yesterday inquired.\u201cShall I prepare something to drink?\u201dI quickly nodded in response to his words. I felt I had to pretend to be occupied with something else. Perhaps they had already made preparations. The attendant swiftly prepared and brought the tea. Though my face was heating up, hot tea didn\u2019t seem appealing, but I had to drink it for the sake of diverting attention.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. It seems the tea I personally selected suits your taste.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dUpon hearing those words, I briefly glanced at the teacup. I had thought it was the tea that the attendants had brought on their own, but Evelina had personally chosen it? The scent and taste were nothing special, so what had appealed to me?With those thoughts in mind, I slowly sipped the tea. Fortunately, as it became difficult to speak under the pretext of drinking tea, the attendants turned to Latvan and began discussing the event. He turned away from me as they did so.After a moment had passed and I had finished the teacup, a sudden sensation swept over me.\u201cOh?\u201dMy head felt a slight dizziness.\u201cLady Saint?\u201dThe attendant who brought the tea called out to me as if asking if something was wrong. As I tried to reassure him that I was fine, the dizziness returned. The moment I thought the ceiling was spinning, a loud crash echoed through the air, and darkness engulfed the world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now he had to go inside, but somehow his steps didn\u2019t come easily. As he hesitated at the door, he noticed the cloak draped over his shoulder.\u201cIf the captain wears it, it would be an honor!\u201dSidel said so, offering her own cloak to Latvan as if she would even strip off her undergarments if he wished.Latvan recalled where his cloak was. It would be neatly hanging on the barren coat rack in his bleak office.In truth, his cloak wasn\u2019t so dirty that he couldn\u2019t wear it. When he wrapped the maiden, a few rotten eggs from her hair had stained it, but that had been easily wiped away with a simple cleaning. The reason Latvan had hung up the cloak was different.He saw the cloak she had worn. Specifically, the lower right part. Sidel\u2019s cloak was immaculate, without a single wrinkle. However, the cloak hanging on the coat rack now would be filled with creases. They were all marks left by the maiden who had made it last night.After a hectic first day of the ceremony, as the deep night set in, Latvan headed to the sanctuary.There was nowhere else in the temple grounds that offered quietude during the ceremony. Occasionally, there were attending priests who sought the sanctuary, but as soon as they exchanged a few words that didn\u2019t seem particularly welcoming, they quickly left.Indeed, when he arrived, the sanctuary was enveloped in tranquil stillness.Latvan purposely walked slowly. The events of the day kept troubling his mind.\u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201dThe maiden is strange.His conflicting emotions of disliking the maiden and yet feeling compelled to fulfill his duty clashed sharply within him. At first, he couldn\u2019t bear the insult and refused to guard her, but in the end, he turned his heart around and went to fulfill his obligation on the morning of the ceremony.Since he had been responsible for guarding the maiden until last year, there was no major issue with rearranging the knight assignments. Rather, the superior knights of the order, who had been responsible for guarding the maiden, couldn\u2019t conceal their relief at Latvan\u2019s change of heart.Just as the knights disliked the maiden, the maiden also disliked them.Of course, it wasn\u2019t always that way. Evelina had been quite friendly with them when she was a young girl. Although they didn\u2019t meet often, whenever she had the chance, she would visit the order and play with the knights, a cute little girl curious about the knights. But at some point, her visits became infrequent, and eventually, they ceased entirely.\u201cWhen did it start?\u201dWhy did Evelina suddenly begin casting disdainful gazes toward them? The exact reason was unknown. In fact, the reason itself wasn\u2019t important. What was important was the fact that the maiden harbored hostility toward the temple knights.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs Latvan momentarily recalled past events, he sighed out of frustration. It wasn\u2019t the time to reminisce about old matters. The individuals who caused a disturbance during the ceremony and were captured were calmly sporting faces even when thrown into the underground prison. Among themselves, they laughed and chattered, saying things like \u201cWe\u2019ll be out soon.\u201d Why they were making such remarks, Latvan knew.They were the ones referred to as the \u201cpeople who dared to criticize the maiden courageously.\u201d And outside the temple, the voices calling for their release seemed to be growing louder.However, regardless of what others said, Latvan had no intention of releasing them easily. They were the ones who had harmed the maiden.\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dThey claimed it was in the name of justice to expose the maiden\u2019s falsehood, but their attitude was strange.\u201cI must conduct a more thorough investigation and deliver my words to the maiden!\u201dAs Latvan pondered what to say to the maiden, he came to a halt when he turned a corner in the sanctuary. On the bench in the corner, he saw a white figure lying lengthwise. There was no need to look closely. It was the maiden.\u201cWhy is she here again?\u201dAfter the conclusion of the prayer meeting, I presumed she would be quietly resting in her room.\u201cAre you planning to have another rendezvous with the men tonight?\u201d I reflexively thought.Upon realizing she was alone, Latvan blushed. It was embarrassing over his audacious speculation.Even though he purposely made a noise with his steps, the saint remained motionless. As he stood there silently, he could hear the rhythmic sound of her breathing. Apparently, she had fallen into a deep slumber.\u201cOh dear.\u201dNo matter how grand the sanctuary was, it was unexpected for someone to sleep so soundly in such a place. Latvan thought he should wake the saint and approached her.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, when Latvan got closer, contrary to his expectations, he found himself unable to utter a single word. The saint, who was asleep on the bench, had an incredibly serene expression on her face.\u201cPerhaps I should just go back.\u201dAs he entertained that thought and attempted to turn away, there was a hand gripping his cloak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Naturally, the owner of that hand was the maiden lying on the bench.\u201cWere you awake?\u201dIf that were the case, it would be impossible not to notice. He had seen the maiden. She still had her eyes closed, and her breathing remained quiet and regular.\u201cMmm\u2026\u201dIt seemed that when he approached, she unconsciously grabbed onto what she had touched. Latvan sighed and cautiously pulled the upper part of his cloak.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, contrary to his expectations, the cloak held tightly in the maiden\u2019s hand did not easily come loose. In fact, the more he tried to pull it away, the stronger her grip became. Did she find comfort in the sensation of holding it? The maiden tugged on his cloak, pulling it over her face like a blanket.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dShe then smiled slightly, as if satisfied, and pulled him into an embrace. Latvan was on the verge of bursting into a hollow laugh at her behavior.\u201cWhat could she be thinking?\u201dHe had witnessed her committing an unseemly act not long ago. Yet here she was, coming out again to sleep so deeply and defenselessly. Latvan couldn\u2019t comprehend her actions.A night breeze blew again, causing the maiden to huddle up even more, shivering in the chilly air.He could perhaps defend against magical attacks, but he couldn\u2019t use his powers to fend off the biting night wind that penetrated their bodies. Moreover, he couldn\u2019t use his healing abilities on himself. If they continued to sleep here, the maiden would not feel well tomorrow morning.\u201cShould I wake her?\u201dAs Latvan contemplated this, he was startled by his own thoughts.Was he genuinely concerned about the maiden?\u201c\u2026\u201dNot long ago, he couldn\u2019t even bear to utter the word \u201cmaiden.\u201d If it hadn\u2019t been for the oath he made before the gods when he entered, he would have immediately resigned from the Temple Knights. But he had made the vow, promising to serve and protect the maiden, the representative of the gods, until his last breath. Furthermore, the position of the commander of the Temple Knights was a lifelong commitment. If he wanted to leave that position, there was no other way but to go to the lair of the demons himself and die.As Latvan recalled his past thoughts, he felt a sense of urgency.He could sense movement near the entrance to the sanctuary. Although he didn\u2019t expect anyone to come, it appeared that there were officials engaged in discussions related to the prayer service.\u201cWhat should I do?\u201dIf they continued like this, people approaching from outside would see the maiden sleeping. If that were to happen\u2026\u201cUnfavorable rumors will spread once again.\u201dThe sanctuary was already filled with rumors about the maiden. What kind of rumors would arise when they saw the two of them together? Latvan could easily predict that. In a place where it was known that the maiden had relationships with men, if the two of them were seen together at night\u2026\u201c\u2026\u201dHis head began to ache. It was as clear as day that if it became known that the maiden had lured the commander of the Temple Knights into the sanctuary, it would not bode well.I have to wake her.And I must quickly send her back to her room for tomorrow\u2019s prayer service.Perhaps it was his sense of urgency that caused the problem. As he pondered what to do, Latvan took hold of the edge of his tightly clung cloak and gently held the maiden\u2019s hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dUpon touching her hand, Latvan found himself staring at the sensation in his own hand.It was the finger that had commanded him to crawl not long ago. At that time, he had felt an overwhelming desire to rush forward and break that finger. Why did it now seem so small and delicate?Furthermore, the sensation of the maiden\u2019s finger in his hand was completely different from his own cold and rough palm. It was warm and soft. It was a sensation he had never even considered, and Latvan froze in place. Meanwhile, the approaching footsteps grew closer.Latvan quickly regained his composure and spoke softly.\u201cFair maiden.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBut there was no response.\u201cFair maiden, please wake up.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHe called out in a louder voice, yet it seemed that his words still failed to reach her ears.Should he shake her awake, even against the saint\u2019s permission? But it was forbidden to touch her without the saint\u2019s consent. Contemplating this rule, Latvan glanced at his own hand. He saw his pale and trembling hand held out before him.He had long been disregarding the rule.After a while, the officials who had delved deep into the sanctuary for a quiet conversation found themselves seated on an empty bench. They could engage in a lengthy discussion for quite some time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one could enter the inner chamber of the saint when night fell, and he considered himself fortunate for that. After all, no one would witness him carrying the saint in his arms.\u201cSo, this is my first time using the secret passage.\u201dLatvan was aware of the hidden passageways that connected to the saint\u2019s chamber. The former commander had informed him about it when he was confirmed as the next leader of the knights.\u201cThis is a secret known only to the commander. The saint probably thinks she\u2019s the only one who knows about it. So, make sure you never let it slip that you\u2019re aware of the existence of the secret passage, unless it\u2019s a truly desperate situation.\u201dThe former commander spoke these words as he led Latvan towards a wall and revealed how to open it.\u201cHe also said not to use it or pretend to know about it unless it\u2019s an urgent situation.\u201dHowever, now he was using this secret passage to bring the sleeping saint back to her chamber. His eyes, accustomed to darkness, navigated the path without stumbling. After walking for a while, he reached a place where the wind ceased.With the saint in his arms, Latvan leaned against the wall. The blue light circled, causing the wall to vanish, revealing a small room on the other side.\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I used my power.\u201dLike the high priests in the temple, the knights of the temple also possessed a certain level of power. However, they rarely used it except in battles against demons.Latvan silently offered a prayer of atonement in his heart towards the departed former commander and continued on his way.Latvan looked at the still-sleeping saint in his arms. Her body was trembling to such an extent that one would think she had died if not for her rhythmic breaths. It seemed that she had fallen into a deep sleep due to exhaustion from the recent events during the final ceremony of the prayer gathering.As the corridor came to an end, the saint\u2019s bedroom came into view. Latvan carefully laid her down on the bed. Only then could he start to contemplate.\u201cWhat have I done?\u201dWhat possessed me to do such a thing?To carry the sleeping saint and bring her to her bedroom using the secret passage. Unable to believe what he had done, Latvan repeatedly wiped his face with his hands.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201dIt seemed that his mind was in a chaotic state. He needed to return quickly through the passage he had used earlier. Even if it was unlikely, the situation of being in her bedroom with the saint made him feel extremely awkward.But just as he took a step back, he had to turn around again.\u201cHa\u2026\u201dThe saint was still holding onto his cloak.Should I just forcefully remove her grip?Even if she held on tightly, there was no way she wouldn\u2019t let go if he did that.\u201c\u2026\u201dHowever, Latvan released the hand that held onto his cloak. Then, he quietly stood by the side of the bed. Though he could have forcefully removed her grip, he somehow disliked the idea.By the time Latvan exited the saint\u2019s room using the secret passage, dawn was breaking in the sky. One side of his cloak was filled with creases, evidence of what had transpired.***That was the events of the previous night.Latvan deliberately turned away from the maiden. Somehow, it was embarrassing to see her now. Even if he had no other thoughts, he had touched the maiden\u2019s body without permission, entered her bedroom, and stood by the side of the sleeping person for quite some time.\u201cWhat have I done?\u201dLatvan couldn\u2019t understand why he had done such a thing, even upon reflection. Above all, what bewildered him was the fact that the disgust he had felt towards the maiden until recently no longer remained.\u201cWhy on earth?\u201dAfter falling down once and getting back up, the maiden is working like a different person. However, that doesn\u2019t mean the things the maiden had done have disappeared. Latvan somehow felt that the current maiden was not the person he used to know.\u201cIt can\u2019t be true.\u201dHe shook his head. Just then, the officials approached him and spoke about the remaining schedule of the prayer meeting. In the meantime, the maiden had requested tea from the officials and received it. Latvan thought it was fortunate that there was no further need for conversation, so he engaged in a long discussion with the officials about work before turning away.While conversing with the officials, he regained some composure from the confusion in his mind.\u201cPull yourself together.\u201dShe is a maiden. If she suddenly does things she didn\u2019t do before, it is only right to be more cautious. Therefore, he must regain his composure and treat her at a distance, just as before.At that moment, he made up his mind.\u201cMaiden!\u201dAs he dropped the teacup, the maiden\u2019s body collapsed to the floor.***I awoke from my slumber, blinking my eyes open.\u201cHow dark it is,\u201d I murmured.The dense darkness enveloped me like black paper, devoid of any other hues. At first, I wondered if I was in a lightless room, but as I lifted my hand for confirmation, it appeared remarkably distinct. Gazing at my hand in the dimness, a sense of unease washed over me. This hand\u2026\u201cIt is my original body.\u201dIt was the body I had died in on the hospital bed. The emaciated wrist twisted grotesquely and the marks of injections covered my arm. Even the skin had become discolored in places due to the medication.Perhaps it was because I had grown accustomed to Evelina\u2019s body. I never expected to feel awkwardness in the body I had inhabited for decades. I raised my head.\u201cWhere am I?\u201dWhere could this entirely black space be? As I surveyed my surroundings, I noticed someone standing behind me. Without intending to, I turned my body to see who it was and exclaimed aloud.\u201cEvelina!\u201dThere she stood. Evelina. Perhaps it was due to seeing a familiar presence, but my heart swelled with joy as I approached her. For the past few weeks, whenever I looked in the mirror, it was her reflection that greeted me. Long, golden hair, fair and rosy skin. A slender neck and elongated limbs that accentuated the curves of a grown woman.At that moment, I truly appreciated Evelina\u2019s beauty.\u201cWell, in the novel, no one denies Evelina\u2019s loveliness.\u201dThen, our gazes met, her blue eyes locking onto mine.Evelina stared straight at me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was truly Evelina looking at me.\u201cHello?\u201dWithout realizing it, I greeted her in response to our eye contact. However, Evelina\u2019s expression changed. The initial curiosity that seemed to question what was happening vanished from her face, replaced by an icy glint that could make anyone shudder with its coldness.Then she spoke.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cPardon? Oh\u2026 I apologize.\u201dCaught off guard by her abrupt question, I took a moment to gather my thoughts and offered an apology. It was clear that she was angry with me; her expression conveyed that unmistakable fury. There was only one reason she would give me such a look.\u201cFor using your body as I please.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dIn that instant, unable to comprehend Evelina\u2019s words, I questioned her while she stared back at me, laughing scornfully.\u201cI pushed you into my body.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dEvelina had put me inside her. It was a thought that had never crossed my mind. I stood there in silence, unable to grasp the situation, as she took a step closer to me. She scrutinized my body and then looked back at hers, speaking in a voice tinged with confusion.\u201cHow about indulging in the pleasures of life once you\u2019ve died? I don\u2019t mean running wild or anything like that.\u201dWas I dreaming? Evelina\u2019s words reached my ears clearly, but my mind failed to comprehend them.If I ever met Evelina\u2019s soul, I had thought she would be furious with me. Or perhaps she would be afraid and weep at the incomprehensible situation. Yet the real Evelina, whom I had finally met, only irritated me.\u201cTo be honest, I had some expectations. I deliberately chose the most pitiful soul among those who are visible. I thought, \u2018Oh, if someone like this uses my body, it will undoubtedly deteriorate more than me. Since life is already lost once, I might as well recklessly enjoy this bonus life,\u2019 you know? But\u2026\u201dApproaching me, Evelina grabbed my chin. Her body was much taller than my original one, so I had to tilt my head to meet her gaze.\u201cYou\u2019ve been unnecessarily diligent, haven\u2019t you? Playing a prank?\u201dHer eyes now held a flicker of anger.\u201cI\u2019ve been watching what you\u2019ve been doing inside me. But\u2026\u201d\u201cWait.\u201dI raised my hand to stop Evelina, who was about to continue speaking. Her face was filled with irritation, as if she were asking how I dared interrupt her. Nonetheless, I managed to silence her.\u201cYou brought me here?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a coincidence\u2026 You chose me?\u201d\u201cYes. Aren\u2019t you grateful?\u201dUntil now, I had thought that all of this had happened by an unknown coincidence. That\u2019s why I always felt sorry for Evelina, who suddenly had her body taken away. But it turned out that everything she wanted had been this.\u201cWhy did you do that?\u201dI couldn\u2019t understand. I didn\u2019t want to know how this was possible, nor did I need to. I simply wanted to understand why Evelina had done this. Without answering my question, she merely smiled. The sight of her smiling infuriated me.In the realm of books, and to top it off, within the body of a doomed fate, I had initially felt despair. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do anything out of fear if it hadn\u2019t been for the ability to see Evelina\u2019s memories.\u201cHaving memories doesn\u2019t make it any easier.\u201dThe situation was dire, enveloped in the worst circumstances imaginable. Everyone despised the saint and those who approached were merely seeking to fulfill their own desires. Moreover, I almost fell victim to the advances of an unknown man. And yet, in the midst of such a predicament, I was expected to be grateful?\u201cWhen have you ever roamed around with such a splendid physique while still alive? Therefore\u2026\u201d\u201cMy physical appearance may have been pleasing, but\u2026\u201dUnable to contain my frustration, I interjected with a sharp voice.\u201cThe situation is far from favorable!\u201dMy discontent-filled words elicited a cackling laughter from Evelina, resonating loudly.\u201cI am the saint, after all.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhile everyone may harbor dissatisfaction, they can only ponder and dare not bring harm to the saint. No matter what one does, they can only complain. For that is the position of the saint, a being whose very existence safeguards the continent against malevolent forces.\u201dAt that moment, a wicked thought crossed my mind.I wanted to speak to Evelina right then and there, to inform her that her ostentatious charade was futile, that this place was merely a realm within a book, and that her cherished position as the saint would be usurped by Iris once she appeared.Yet, I remained silent.When I lost all my powers within the book and was no longer a saint, I recalled the image of Evelina. How she had died, proclaiming herself a saint as if consumed by madness. In the current situation, provoking Evelina would serve no purpose other than to invite trouble.However, remaining silent infuriated me. I yearned to retort to her words with any response.\u201cYet you threw eggs.\u201dUnable to conjure a suitable retort, I spoke those words, and Evelina\u2019s face contorted.\u201cCome to think of it, why didn\u2019t you punish Latvan? The Grand Knight couldn\u2019t even protect the saint. And it happened during a ceremony where the highest precautions should have been taken. In that case, he should pay for his sins with his life.\u201dWith each word spoken by Evelina, her voice oozed with disdain. Her suggestion to slit his throat was no jest. The regret of missing such a perfect opportunity gnawed at me, causing my body to tremble.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps something had occurred that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the book? However, based on Latvan\u2019s demeanor, he didn\u2019t seem like someone who would cause harm or bear grudges against others. If Evelina disliked him because her demands were not met, I could understand to some extent. But to exhibit such vehement fury?\u201cHe did nothing wrong.\u201d\u201cTh-this\u2026 release me\u2026\u201d\u201cHe truly did nothing wrong.\u201dAs Evelina muttered those words, she soon released her grip on my throat. Though she hadn\u2019t exerted excessive force, my fragile body was prone to breaking with even the slightest impact.[Cough!]As Evelina released her grip, my vision blurred. Unable to regain my composure easily, I swayed before her eyes. Her bored expression turned into one of annoyance as she spoke.\u201cI made a grave mistake in choosing you.\u201dShe then gazed into the distance.\u201cI thought it would be entertaining. That\u2019s why I deliberately chose someone like you. But I suppose it\u2019s better to give the chance to other pitiful souls. To those who live according to their desires, unabashedly.\u201dA chill crept into one side of my chest. I understood what Evelina meant by her words. She was now seeking another soul to inhabit her body.I had always pondered it.Having entered a body without reason, it could depart without reason someday.One must prepare oneself in advance to not feel unjust or saddened when departing from Evelina\u2019s body. That\u2019s why I had made daily preparations in my own way, but when Evelina mentioned choosing another soul, fear overwhelmed me.My body trembled. I never expected that the extra life I had luckily received would end like this.\u201cAm I really going to die now?\u201dWith that thought in mind, I lowered my head and sat down, and Evelina approached me, sitting in front of me and chuckling softly.\u201cIndeed, did this body please you? You seem so reluctant to let go.\u201dI couldn\u2019t respond to her teasing words. Every word Evelina spoke was the truth. I lifted my head and gazed at her. The healthy body I had enjoyed until just a while ago was shining before my eyes.I recalled the routines I had enjoyed over the past few weeks.When I wanted to go somewhere, I could go without any worries. The tiredness that followed a day of walking felt fascinating. The breeze brushing my face as I ran down empty corridors felt delightful. The ability to endure unfamiliar tasks in an unfamiliar world was all thanks to that joy.Now, I can no longer experience it.It was never truly mine to begin with. If the owner wants it back, I must return it. But why does it feel so unjust and regretful?Tears fell onto the back of my hand. I realized I was crying without even noticing. It was embarrassing and irritating to show such a side to Evelina. As I turned my head away, she laughed. Then, she grabbed my hair and forced me to look at her.\u201cDo you desire this body?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer. She had asked the question even though she already knew the answer.\u201cYou may have it.\u201dIn an instant, my heart leaped. Evelina\u2019s words expressed my deepest desires. I knew I had only two more years to live. Yet, I still desired Evelina\u2019s body.\u201cBut there is one condition.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201dI couldn\u2019t even hide my anxious heart. My dry wrist held onto Evelina. Unlike my rough, calloused skin, her skin was soft and fair, and in that moment, my greed grew stronger.I want this body again. Even if it has an end, I want Evelina\u2019s body, not someone else\u2019s.\u201cI don\u2019t know if you can do it\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do anything.\u201dAs I replied, a wicked smile formed on Evelina\u2019s face. She intended to mock and toy with me. She would surely demand something absurd. But it didn\u2019t matter what it was. As Evelina looked at me and simply laughed, my impatience forced me to ask first.\u201cDo I\u2026 have to kill someone?\u201dThe greatest sin and the most difficult thing I could think of was undoubtedly murder. However, Evelina shook her head at my words.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible. A saint cannot kill others. Suicide is also out of the question.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dEvelina\u2019s voice was firm, as if she had already attempted it.\u201cAnd it\u2019s not even enjoyable. It\u2019s better to have fun, right? So\u2026 yes, let\u2019s go with something that seems challenging for you.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by challenging me?\u201dEvelina spoke with a brighter smile than ever before.\u201cEngage in sexual intercourse with a man. Within a week.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A man and a wager? And within a week? Evelina\u2019s face lit up with a newfound delight, as if she had finally achieved the reaction she desired.\u201cIf you can\u2019t accomplish it within a week, I will immediately seize your body.\u201d\u201cWhy on earth would you do such a thing?\u201dThere was no extraordinary reason behind her proposition. She simply wanted to witness my distress. No, even if I were not the one, Evelina would have imposed the same conditions. Strangely enough, it seemed as if she yearned for someone to ruffle her being. I couldn\u2019t fathom the reason behind it, no matter how much I pondered.\u201cThat is none of your concern.\u201dEvelina uttered those words, and tenderly planted her lips on my forehead. It was as if she was bestowing her blessing upon the endeavor I was about to undertake.\u201cIt\u2019s an exceedingly easy task.\u201d With just a flutter of your garment, men will readily succumb. It may sound audacious coming from my mouth, but this body of mine certainly has a way of captivating their desires.\u201dAs Evelina spoke, her countenance momentarily contorted. It was a fleeting moment, imperceptible unless one observed closely.\u201cNow, go forth and return no more.\u201dWith those words, Evelina pushed me away. In that instant, I felt as if I were plummeting into a distant abyss, and consciousness slipped away from me. From a far-off distance, I heard Evelina\u2019s laughter echoing in the air.***When I opened my eyes, it was a familiar place. The ceiling of the saint\u2019s bedroom, where I had always fallen asleep, came into view.\u201cYour Grace!\u201dAs I opened my eyes and sat up, the attendants beside me called out to me like screams. They hurriedly brought water and summoned other attendants, appearing restless.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cDo you not remember? While preparing for the second day of prayer, you suddenly collapsed. You couldn\u2019t regain consciousness for three whole days, and we were all deeply concerned. But to see you rise like this unharmed, it seems that the divine powers are always watching over you, Your Grace.\u201dNo, the reason I woke up was because I thought Evelina would send me away. However, there was something else that bothered me.\u201cThree days?\u201d\u201cYes. Since your stomach must be quite weak at the moment, we shall prepare easily digestible soup for you.\u201dThe attendants spoke thus and busily moved around, causing a commotion. It was then that I heard a voice in my ear.Only four days remain. Stay strong.\u201cEvelina!\u201dI called her name absentmindedly. The attendants standing beside me looked at me with eyes that seemed to question what kind of sound I was making.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dYes, for now, I am Evelina. Ignoring the pouring gazes, I looked at my hands. Snowy and flawless, without a single blemish, the skin caught my eye.\u201cSo, it was a condition that included the time I was unconscious.\u201dIt must have been. I recalled Evelina\u2019s whispering voice from a moment ago. Four days. To grow with someone within four days?I looked at my hands again. If this was still my hand four days later, then I had to follow Evelina\u2019s absurd command.***Fortunately, there were no significant issues with my health. It was unbelievable how someone who had collapsed for three days could bounce back as if nothing had happened. It was simply impossible to act as if nothing had occurred.Once I regained consciousness, I inquired about what had transpired during my absence. It seemed like a complete frenzy right after I collapsed. The attendant who had promptly brought me tea when I fainted was imprisoned. She tearfully spoke,\u201cThis tea was personally given to me by the Lady! She instructed me to serve it from now on! I haven\u2019t done anything wrong!\u201dThe attendants scrutinized all the tea leaves that were brought from the kitchen in response to her words. They brewed and chewed them repeatedly, even investigating if the attendant had received a horoscope from someone else. Consequently, a name emerged naturally. It was Karus.A few days ago, Karus, in a fit of rage that could be heard from outside, had stormed into the Lady\u2019s chambers. Now, the attendants who had kept their lips sealed all this time confessed everything. As a result, Karus was immediately dragged down to the underground prison. The problem, however, arose from there.\u201cRelease him! Are you daring to put a senior attendant in the underground prison?\u201dKarus resisted harshly, defying the Temple Knights as he was being dragged underground. Then, the imprisoned individuals inside heard his voice and rushed to the iron bars, calling out to him.\u201cAh? Senior Attendant Karus!\u201d\u201cWhat, what is it? Why is Senior Attendant Karus here?\u201dAt that moment, Latvan did not miss their conversation.\u201cSo, they were acquainted.\u201dHis words silenced Karus and the men, but it was already too late.\u201cSo\u2026 it was Karus\u2019s horoscope that led to the egg-throwing and the commotion during the prayer gathering.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLatvan bowed his head. He had wondered what Karus would do, and it seemed he had chosen this path. It was a problem in the sense that he had gained nothing from it, but it appeared he intended to spread information about the other men as well, attempting to blackmail them.\u201cHow foolish. It seems that Evelina wouldn\u2019t bother about such things.\u201dHe recalled the conversations he had shared with her in his subconscious. It had been a short time, but he could discern what kind of person Evelina was. She might have even found it amusing and encouraged Karus to do more.Sighing, he reviewed the current situation.\u201cIn the end, I missed the second day of the prayer gathering.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Fake Saintess Awaits Her ExitCH 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHow could I have attended when I had fainted? However, it seemed that the story had spread a bit differently outside. They claimed that the Lady, sensing an impending attack, had fainted and thus couldn\u2019t attend. It felt unjust. I had memorized so many prayers. I diligently prepared for the prayer gathering, walking until my feet were sore. But in the end, all that effort went unnoticed.Suddenly, the contents of the novel came to mind.During the prayer gathering, Evelina had used the excuse of feeling unwell to avoid attending. Of course, no one believed her.\u201cHmm?\u201dIn the novel, it was not mentioned what Evelina did during the time she didn\u2019t attend the prayer gathering. It would have been interesting to see if she had done something during that time that would make readers despise her even more.Suddenly, that thought struck me. What if Evelina had truly been unwell? Just like me at this moment?\u201cLady?\u201d\u201cAh, I apologize.\u201dInterrupted from my reverie by Latvan\u2019s call, I slightly bowed my head to acknowledge him.\u201cThank you for the detailed report. You may return now.\u201dSince opening my eyes and sitting up, I could easily spot Latvan wherever I looked. It seemed that after his collapse, he had hardly slept, wandering around to investigate the cause.\u201cBut eventually, we still don\u2019t know the reason.\u201dAt this point, I began to suspect that the problem wasn\u2019t really the tea but rather the fact that Evelina wanted to summon me, perhaps when she pushed me in that dark space. I thought about it as I prepared to bid farewell to Latvan.\u201cI\u2019m afraid that won\u2019t be possible.\u201dI expected him to greet me as usual and leave, but he didn\u2019t.\u201cI heard you are scheduled to meet the imperial delegation tonight.\u201d\u201cThat is true, but\u2026\u201dThe prayer meeting, which had been suspended while she was unconscious, had ended, and most of the diplomatic delegations that were waiting for an audience had already left.One could argue that they couldn\u2019t even wait for three days. However, I was in a state where I didn\u2019t know when I would wake up, and most of the delegations seemed to doubt the fact that Evelina had collapsed. They probably thought it was just an excuse for the saint to avoid meeting them.\u201cMoreover, it wouldn\u2019t be wise to stay here when everyone else is avoiding us.\u201dDue to that, most of the delegations quickly gave up on the audience and left the temple. But not all of them had left. The Appelius Empire\u2019s delegation, which I had expected to be the first to depart, was still waiting for the saint.Initially, I had thought about asking them to leave, considering that meeting them would be difficult. However, I changed my mind about meeting them. More precisely, I decided to be faithful to what the saint should do.There was only one reason to do something I didn\u2019t have to do\u2014it was my resentment toward Evelina.I recalled her mocking me, using this body to taunt me like a starving beggar, shaking food in front of me as if playing a prank. That voice still echoed vividly in my ears. Even if I received such treatment, I couldn\u2019t rebel. It was because it was true that I desired this body. If I wanted to live on in this body, I had to do as she commanded.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want to obediently follow Evelina\u2019s commands.\u201dAnything would have sufficed. I wanted to defy Evelina. Then, something occurred to me. She was annoyed by my diligence.\u201cShe said I was working diligently for no reason.\u201dThe moment I remembered her words, I spoke to the officials. I wanted to meet the Appelius delegation. Right away.Under the influence of her words, I didn\u2019t tremble in fear and rush out to find a man. I certainly didn\u2019t want that to be the image Evelina desired.***As the appointed hour approached, I made my way to the banquet hall accompanied by several attendants. Latvan, along with several other temple knights, stood closely by, poised and vigilant. The door swung open, and as I stepped into the hall, the envoy from Appelius, who had arrived earlier, rose to their feet and bowed before me.The envoy consisted of three individuals. They had expressed a desire for a discreet audience, hence their minimal presence. Among the three, a man stood out as the representative, approaching me and gracefully sinking to one knee. In response to his gesture, I extended my hand, and he reverently brushed his lips against my palm.His touch stirred a sense of familiarity within me. The soft, golden strands of his hair seemed vaguely familiar.Of course, it couldn\u2019t be. How long has it been since I last encountered someone in this world? Meanwhile, the man placed a gentle kiss upon my hand.Typically, such greetings involved a brief exchange of lips followed by a respectful separation. However, this man lingered, his lips pressed against mine for an extended moment. His behavior left me slightly bewildered, and in that moment, a peculiar sensation coursed through my hand.\u201c\u2026!\u201dClearly, it was the sensation of a tongue grazing my palm\u2014a sensation I had never anticipated. Startled by this unexpected occurrence, I saw the man lift his head.Intense, azure eyes were fixed upon me. They were undoubtedly eyes etched into my memory. Where had I seen them before? Where\u2026?It was then that the man parted his lips and spoke.\u201cIt is a pleasure to meet you again, Lady, in this auspicious encounter.\u201d\u201cYou.\u201dThe elderly man who had blessed me during the prayer assembly stood before me, transformed entirely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, I had never imagined his true form would be like this.The man ceased his palm-licking gesture. Though the nearby onlookers seemed perplexed by the slightly elongated meeting of palms, their confusion stopped there. Only he and I knew the nature of his previous actions. Should I reprimand his impertinence or simply let it pass as if it were of no consequence? While pondering this dilemma, he rose to his feet.He was a rather tall man, appearing no less substantial even when standing next to Latvan. It was uncommon to find someone of such physique who did not seem small in comparison to the knight, Latvan. Of course, his impression differed considerably from that of the knight.A mane of bright golden hair of moderate length bestowed a vibrant aura upon him. Beneath straight, well-groomed eyebrows rested deep azure eyes, a refined nose, and well-shaped lips. Overall, he exuded a striking appearance that seemed exceedingly resplendent. Despite everything being impeccably neat, he carried an air of self-assurance as if he had possessed it since birth. Superficially, it could be mistaken for arrogance, but such an atmosphere suited him remarkably well.My senses were sharply attuned to this man\u2019s presence.He was definitely no ordinary person.\u201cWho are you?\u201dBefore I could finish my sentence, he smiled.\u201cMy name is Leon Habel Appelius.\u201dAppelius? As I contemplated stepping back from that name, he approached me and spoke.\u201cI am the Crown Prince of the Appelius Empire.\u201dHis words caused a chilling silence to descend upon the banquet hall.***A few weeks ago, Leon was summoned by the Emperor, his father.Despite his weariness, Leon humbly bowed his head in genuine reverence for the Emperor\u2019s enduring majesty. He had been the conquering Emperor who led the Empire before becoming his father. As a citizen of the Empire, it was only appropriate for Leon to hold profound respect for such a figure.The Emperor, now ruling the Empire through his son, issued a simple command.\u201cGo and inspect the temple for me.\u201dHad there been anyone else present, Leon would have maintained his usual light smile without a hint of concern. However, in this moment, there was only the Emperor and no one else, and Leon did not hide his displeasure.Though the Emperor was known for his rationality and firmness, he was also a father with finite patience towards his son. Thus, the Emperor merely pursed his lips in response to Leon\u2019s expression, refraining from scolding him.\u201cDo you find even that task distasteful?\u201d\u201cIt is simply tedious, Your Majesty.\u201dLeon\u2019s prompt response earned him a pursed lip from the Emperor. Undoubtedly, the command must have seemed mundane to Leon. He had been born and raised within the confines of the palace, giving the impression of a life untouched by hardship. His appearance exuded elegance and grace, seemingly devoid of any coarseness. However, the Emperor knew that beneath that visage, his son concealed a savage nature.\u201cBlood cannot be deceived.\u201dDespite his resemblance to the Empress, Leon possessed the hunger of a famished lion, despite his outward appearance resembling that of a peacock.\u201cSurely, you have other tasks to attend to. After all, you recently dismantled Astia.\u201dAstia, a relatively powerful nation located at the edge of the Empire. Leon had led the Imperial Army and exacted retribution for Astia\u2019s transgressions, even going so far as to charge them interest. Now, there was no country by the name of Astia to be found anywhere on the continent.As Leon, still driven by his boiling blood, sought his next prey, the Emperor could only express disappointment at the prospect of Leon inspecting the temple.\u201cI would rather take care of affairs within the palace. There are many matters to attend to.\u201d\u201cThe saint is acting peculiarly.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dLeon straightened his posture. His informants had not provided him with such information. The Emperor\u2019s network of information still held an advantage over Leon\u2019s.\u201cI heard she has been working diligently since her recent collapse.\u201dThose words brought a disappointed expression to Leon\u2019s face. It was the same information he had received from his own sources. However, the following words from the Emperor stiffened his body.\u201cAnd it seems the Night Escapades of the Commander of the Templars have become frequent.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dLeon inwardly cursed. The temple had been the only place his network of informants had been unable to penetrate. The Emperor had planted people even there.\u201cInvestigate it thoroughly and report back.\u201d\u201cI understand, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cWhile you\u2019re at it, offer some prayers for atonement for the slaughter.\u201d\u201cDo you mean to say I should become a priest?\u201dPrayers for atonement for slaughter\u2014something that neither of the nobles ever engaged in. The conversation came to an end there.Upon returning to his office, Leon gave his subordinates simple instructions. These subordinates, who were suddenly redirected from the battlefield to the temple, raised their eyebrows in curiosity and asked him.\u201cHas the saint finally captured your interest?\u201d\u201cAh, the saint.\u201dLeon replied as if he had just remembered.In truth, the Crown Prince\u2019s interest lay not with the saint but with the Commander of the Templars, Latvan. When asked to name the strongest knight on the continent, people would unanimously mention Latvan without hesitation. It was a sore point for the Imperial Knights. Leon had yet to meet Latvan in person, having only heard rumors of his exploits.Stories of his feats such as slaying demons with an unblessed sword in a single strike or single-handedly facing hordes of demons that engulfed entire villages.Upon hearing that Latvan had recently severed ties with the saint, Leon wondered how he could somehow bring Latvan into the ranks of the Imperial Knights.\u201cIf I go to the temple, I must meet this man called Latvan.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Leon\u2019s instincts shouted that these two things were intertwined.While Leon was contemplating Latvan, a subordinate who was organizing documents spoke up.\u201cWell, she must have played with the young men and princesses in the palace quite often. It seems like it\u2019s time to set our sights on the saint. From what I hear, she\u2019s considered second to the empire in terms of beauty alone.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not someone who judges based on appearances.\u201dThat was true. Leon didn\u2019t dislike beautiful women. However, he preferred interesting women. And if they were dangerous, even better.What kind of woman was the saint? Leon fell into deep thought. If he gathered all the information brought by his informants\u2026 a foolish and promiscuous saint would be very different from his taste.Disguised with a fake identity, Leon accompanied the diplomatic mission. Since he had moved separately and didn\u2019t reveal his face, very few people knew that he was joining the delegation heading to the temple.After arriving at the temple, Leon acted to carry out the emperor\u2019s orders. He gained a few things, but nothing particularly special. In the end, Leon thought that he had to take matters into his own hands.\u201cI must meet the commander of the Order of Templars.\u201dHowever, Leon couldn\u2019t openly move with the diplomatic mission. Among the diplomats from various countries, many knew Leon\u2019s face. And a significant number of them would want to draw their swords as soon as they saw him. But that wasn\u2019t the biggest problem.\u201cYou won\u2019t be providing security?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. The informants confirmed it. Someone else will be in charge of protecting the saint this year.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dLeon inwardly whistled. Somehow, he had to make Latvan come out of the Order of Templars. If he continued to provoke his pride a few more times\u2026\u201cIt seems his pride needs to be hurt a few more times.\u201dIt would be convenient to completely alienate him from the temple. With that in mind, Leon turned his gaze toward the saint. He couldn\u2019t wound the commander of the Order of Templars with ordinary people. Using the saint, whom he was the only one to obey, would be the quickest and most reliable method.\u201cThe saint, right? I heard she replaces men every night.\u201dOne of Leon\u2019s observant subordinates answered.\u201cIt seems she quite likes men with blond hair and blue eyes.\u201d\u201cFortunately. The saint should take a liking to me.\u201dEveryone raised their heads at Leon\u2019s playful remark. They hadn\u2019t expected to be tasked with pushing the crown prince onto the saint, they thought.\u201cBut before that, I\u2019d like to see the saint once.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, attending the prayer meeting seems to be the fastest way.\u201dAfter hearing the explanation about the prayer meeting from his subordinate, Leon decided to make things a little more interesting.Even Leon himself found his appearance repulsive. People distanced themselves from him due to the appearance that seemed to be covered in skin diseases and the stench emanating from the intentionally worn stable clothes. Despite being finely crafted, the flaw of the fake skin couldn\u2019t deceive even the eyes. However, as long as everyone kept their distance like this, no one would notice anything strange about him.\u201cI should put on a play today.\u201dIntentionally digging through the crowd, he positioned himself at the spot where the saint would pass by. It was time for the blessing prayer, and the saint would pass by him.\u201cI might not be able to touch her, but I might as well demand her presence.\u201dConsidering everything he had heard about the saint so far, the likelihood was overwhelming. Should he act as if he had been pushed aside by the crowd, pretending to be a poor old man at his last breath, clutching onto the hem of her clothing? While contemplating such thoughts, Leon looked toward the entrance upon hearing that the saint had appeared.\u201cHuh?\u201dA spontaneous gasp escaped my lips as a figure stood before me, instantly recognizable even without a word spoken. It was Sir Latvan, the valiant commander of the Holy Knights.\u201cSurely, I heard he does not provide protection,\u201d I muttered under my breath.However, there was no doubt that the man standing alongside the maiden was none other than Latvan himself. With an impassive countenance, he held the maiden\u2019s hand, offering her his escort. Leon averted his gaze, his attention drawn to the hands that held the maiden\u2019s. He observed Latvan\u2019s rough, calloused hand against the fair skin of the maiden, treasuring it with an unspoken tenderness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Such a widely known escort, isn\u2019t he?\u201cBut it should be impossible between those two.\u201dLatvan had experienced the humiliation of begging like a dog in front of the saint, pleading for mercy for his subordinates. And yet, he was working as an escort like that?\u201cHe clearly refused to be her bodyguard.\u201dBut now, all of a sudden, he was back to protecting the saint. There was only one answer to that. Something must have happened between them that could change their relationship.\u201cSurely the saint didn\u2019t seduce the commander into her bed.\u201dAccording to the information he heard, Latvan was not someone who could be easily persuaded by such things. If they had been physically involved, rumors would have spread long ago. Latvan and the saint had known each other for a very long time.\u201cWhat kind of miracle did the saint show?\u201dThere seemed to be no other way to change the heart of the knight commander, who was so devoted to his faith in the gods. Latvan couldn\u2019t think of anything else.In the midst of these thoughts, the saint was approaching. People started pushing forward, causing a commotion as the line collapsed. Leon didn\u2019t miss the opportunity. Pretending to stumble, he rolled into a position where he would be clearly visible to the saint. He didn\u2019t forget to remove his hood. As he did so, he shouted loudly.\u201cOh, Saint! Please bestow upon me the prayer of blessing!\u201dAll eyes were on him. Whether to push him away or to bring him closer. Either way, he wanted to get closer to the saint. Soon, the saint whispered something to Latvan and let go of his hand, then approached Leon. At that moment, a loud voice came from behind.\u201cYou filthy harlot!\u201dChaos erupted starting with those words. Eggs were thrown, people shouted angrily. Leon looked at the commotion with annoyance in his eyes. Just when he thought he would finally get a closer look at the saint, something like this ruined his chance. But soon, his eyes widened. It was because the saint, whom he thought would go back into the temple, was coming towards him.Finally, the saint stood in front of him and asked.\u201cDo you still seek my blessing?\u201dAs she spoke, the saint looked very composed. Ignoring the commotion around them, she approached him. Leon was delighted that she had come closer just for him.\u201cHow interesting.\u201dNodding his head, Leon felt the short prayer of blessing from the saint. And then, she kissed his forehead, which was covered with repulsive skin and a disgusting smell. Leon knew that she wasn\u2019t doing it to show off to someone else. Even the priests took a step back, but the saint, who had been inside the main temple all along, showed no hesitation.The saint, who had kissed his forehead, tried to move away.\u201cWhat a pity.\u201dIt was a shame to end it like this. He wanted to meet her a little longer. His instincts were telling him that this woman wouldn\u2019t be just an interesting woman. Leon reached out his hand and gently grabbed the long, golden hair that was swaying in front of him. The sensation of it wrapping around his hand delighted him.When he raised his head, their eyes met. In that moment, he saw the tremor in the saint\u2019s eyes. He recognized his disguise at a glance. Leon kissed the hair he held in his hand.\u201cI shall eagerly await the day I see you again, Your Holiness.\u201dNext time, he wanted to kiss her in a different place.A few days after that incident, Leon was so thrilled that he could barely contain himself. Especially today, ever since he received the letter from the saint saying she would meet with the imperial envoy, he couldn\u2019t help but sing with joy.\u201cFinally, we shall meet again.\u201dThe image of the saint he saw at the prayer meeting passed through his mind. Standing amidst the flowing rotten eggs, enduring the finger-pointing from the people.***I gazed ahead, feeling the cold, heavy air settle around me as if I were dining on ice. This encounter, which was supposed to be a gathering of four, including myself, felt more like a meal shared between the prince and me. It was only natural, considering the other two members of the diplomatic delegation hardly spoke, leaving all the conversation to Prince Leon.\u201cI would take pride in returning to the palace with the knowledge that I dined with the princess. Many would envy such an opportunity,\u201d he remarked.Amidst this heavy atmosphere, I seemed to shine alone. Someone who, upon first glance, might be thought lacking in subtlety and speed\u2014a person easily dismissed. Yet, adorned with exaggerated gestures, laughter, and a blend of light-hearted jokes.\u201cWhy has this person appeared so early?\u201d I wondered.Prince Leon, one of the male protagonists in the novel, possessed an impressively strong presence, even among the numerous individuals surrounding us. Strangely enough, the first time I laid eyes on him, I had a similar impression, reminiscent of when I first met Latban. He stood out so distinctly that one could recognize him amidst a crowd.The problem was that he would encounter Evelina much later. According to the book, he disliked formal occasions and disguised his identity when visiting the palace, returning to the empire promptly after gathering the necessary information. It was only after meeting Iris that he began visiting the palace as his true self.Yet here he was, enjoying his meal merrily in front of me. Such a sight sent chills down my spine.The book described him in detail, too. A person who appeared careless but possessed a mind more cunning than anyone else\u2019s, thoroughly enjoying warfare. The person who exchanged greetings with a smile, but if deemed a threat to the empire, would swiftly eliminate them.As I scrutinized him quietly, he seemed to notice my gaze and changed his expression slightly before speaking.\u201cOh, it seems I have been doing all the talking. I\u2019m concerned whether you have forced yourself to receive me, despite not feeling well,\u201d he said, his gaze shifting towards my nearly untouched plate.\u201cThank you for your concern. Rather than that, I worry if I have been neglectful in entertaining an unexpected guest like yourself,\u201d I replied.This was not merely a courteous remark. It was rather abrupt to have the empire\u2019s prince right beside me. The expressions on the faces of the courtiers standing next to me became rigid, as if they had turned into statues. If they had known that the prince was present in the diplomatic delegation, this encounter would likely not have taken place at all.\u201cOur relationship is not a good one,\u201d I thought.The prince, who strove to place the Divine Temple under the empire\u2019s feet, was standing before me. That was why there was an invisible power struggle between the Divine Temple and the empire across the continent. Whenever news of demons appearing spread, the Divine Temple knights set out, only for the empire\u2019s knights to arrive first and deal with the demons. Or when reports of an epidemic surfaced, the temple\u2019s clergy rushed to assist, only to find that the empire\u2019s doctors had already arrived to attend to the people. It was an ongoing hidden conflict between the two powers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, suddenly and unexpectedly, the prince, who could be considered the leader of the opposition, had appeared in enemy territory. The courtiers, who were still in a state of shock, seemed unable to turn away from the prince\u2019s gaze. Ignoring their gazes, he leisurely ordered more wine and continued to enjoy the meal.\u201cI sincerely apologize for not informing you in advance. Originally, I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to attend the prayer meeting due to empire matters, but things concluded sooner than expected, allowing me to join later,\u201d he smoothly lied without batting an eye.\u201cSuch nonsense. How could someone who came in such a hurry be prepared to disguise himself?\u201d I thought.As I glared at him, he still met my gaze with a smile, as if saying, \u201cSo what if it\u2019s a lie?\u201d He requested wine once again, but now it seemed he had lost interest in the meal. He lowered his fork, no longer focused on eating, and asked me a question.\u201cHowever, it is a great pity.\u201d\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201dTightly strung, I responded to his words. I could feel the crown prince\u2019s scrutinizing gaze. What is he trying to say?\u201cIt reminds me of the offerings made in the name of the Empire\u2019s princess. Knowing Your Highness\u2019s discerning eye, we carefully selected and brought the finest craftsmanship of the Empire, but\u2026 it seems our sincerity may still be lacking.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAn uncomfortable silence lingered. Among the attending courtiers, I noticed faces frozen in discomfort. The prince\u2019s words could be interpreted as, \u201cYou didn\u2019t do as I asked, even though I specifically mentioned things you like.\u201d He sarcastically commented that as a princess, I should offer sacrifices that resemble extravagant jewellery and trinkets, satisfying personal desires.\u201cTreating me like a woman engaged in an exchange of gifts with the princess.\u201dIt is not befitting for the princess to question why I did not use the items I gave.In response, I looked at the crown prince. Regardless of the reactions around him, he wore a smile as if he knew nothing. Yet, his gaze continued to scrutinize me, waiting to see how I would react.\u2018What should I do?\u2019I caught sight of the fork I had set down on the table. If it were Evelina, she might have picked it up and thrown it at the crown prince\u2019s forehead. I remember she became furious to the point of forbidding the mention of his name again when he mentioned Evelina, terrifyingly venting her anger.If she were treated this way by her counterpart, she would likely immediately issue an order to capture and detain the crown prince, without considering the aftermath, of course.\u201cHow should I proceed?\u201dThe crown prince seemed somehow like a child who had just received a new toy. He was filled with excitement, not knowing what to do, wanting to touch or try something more.For now, I wanted to end it here for today. Merely contemplating Evelina\u2019s conditions for me is exhausting enough. I\u2019ve done enough for this audience, and it\u2019s probably time to leave. With that in mind, I smiled at the crown prince.\u201cI apologize for not having had the opportunity to examine the offerings sent from the Empire. I am grateful for the wheat and wine sent for those gathered here. May the gods always be with you.\u201dFor the first time, Leon\u2019s expression stiffened at my words. Seeing his face brought some satisfaction. Well, after sending such a substantial amount without even looking at it, it must have wounded his pride to hear that. Just then, Latvan, who stood behind him, spoke up.\u201cYour Highness, it is time for you to prepare for the next engagement.\u201d\u201cYes, I suppose it\u2019s time to rise.\u201dI replied and looked at Latvan. His expression was as blank as usual.\u201cI thought the crown prince was the only one skilled at lying.\u201dI should reconsider Latvan as well. In truth, I have no further engagements after this audience. Yet, Latvan must have bid farewell with those parting words, hoping for the gods\u2019 presence during our farewell.\u201cThen, I shall take my leave now. I regret that I cannot join you for dessert, Crown Prince Leon. May peace accompany you on your journey to the Empire\u2026.\u201dIt was then that Crown Prince Leon interrupted my words.\u201cI plan to stay at the temple for a while.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cI have committed many unavoidable sins while working for the Empire. Since I happened to come to the temple, I intend to offer extended prayers until those sins are forgiven.\u201dThe crown prince looked at me with a rather sincere expression.\u201cSo, next time, I would like to enjoy what we couldn\u2019t do today, together, Your Highness.\u201dSomehow, his words sounded different.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It felt as if the uneaten meal had lodged itself in my throat. Thankfully, the refreshing air outside allowed me to catch my breath.\u201cWe\u2019re exhausted.\u201dAmidst the heavy atmosphere, we had to read each other\u2019s thoughts as if we were mad. We had to mind our manners and choose our words carefully. Summoning every bit of recollection and employing conversational techniques from the books I had read, I managed to respond, leaving me feeling utterly drained.\u201cI think I managed to answer fairly well, all things considered.\u201dI noticed a slight stiffening in Prince Leon\u2019s expression. If I hadn\u2019t been in the habit of observing people, I would never have caught on.\u201cStill, it\u2019s satisfying to have given them a taste of their own medicine.\u201dI thought so as I finally let go of the burden. After walking for a while, I spotted the door to my room. I turned around and nodded slightly to Latvan, who had been following closely behind me.\u201cThank you for your assistance today, Sir Latvan.\u201dIn response, he tilted his head slightly.\u201cI appreciate your help in the end.\u201dIn truth, I wanted to say more. Thanks to his quick thinking about preparing the next schedule, we were able to bid farewell to the imperial envoy, including Prince Leon, without much trouble. If I had announced that I had an engagement and had to leave, it would have been obvious that I was avoiding them. However, if someone else, especially Sir Latvan, had said it, it would have seemed like a genuine reason for me to leave.Of course, the subsequent schedule only involved resting in my room.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe did not respond to my second expression of gratitude. A moment of silence passed.\u201cIs it because I lied that I feel unsettled?\u201dI recalled that the Code of the Holy Knights had a provision requiring honesty. Of course, it couldn\u2019t be followed perfectly, but one should strive to uphold it as much as possible.\u201cAlthough it may not bring any good as a High Knight to spend too much time with the prince.\u201dThat seemed to be the reason Latvan had lied and helped me leave. I couldn\u2019t find any other reason why he would go so far as to lie to let me leave. While I pondered this, Latvan spoke.\u201cYou are not a pleasant person.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201d\u201cYou give an unpleasant impression. It would be better to keep your distance until we return.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWith his lengthened words, I finally realized that he was talking about Prince Leon.Frankly, it was bewildering. It surprised me that Latvan would mention something other than what I was asking about. And what\u2019s more, it was an assessment of someone else.\u201cMoreover\u2026\u201dThis was the first time he displayed such strong emotions about something. Because of that, he seemed more human to me than ever before. It was quite fascinating. As I stared at him intently, Latvan lowered his head.\u201cI apologize. I spoke off-topic.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s all right. Thank you for your concern. You may go now; I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need any further protection today.\u201dI replied like that, yet he didn\u2019t turn away. Instead, he seemed hesitant, as if he had something else to say. After a brief pause, he cautiously spoke.\u201cWhen will a decision be made about my punishment?\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dPunishment? What punishment? I quickly realized that he was asking about the responsibility for the failed security during the prayer meeting.\u201cI didn\u2019t intend to hold you accountable for any mistakes\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t want to ask about it at all. If I hadn\u2019t ordered him to bring the prince on the day of the prayer meeting, he would have casually refused. Ultimately, it was my doing that led to his failure, and I didn\u2019t want to hold him responsible for that.\u201cBesides, I could really use a break.\u201dWhen I first met Latvan, his chilling aura and contemptuous gaze made it difficult to even look at him. But now, we had reached a point where we could have conversations like this without difficulty. Moreover, whether it was him hiding it or my misconception, the disdainful gaze he had towards me seemed to have disappeared.I never thought our relationship could improve. Even now, we couldn\u2019t say that we had a good relationship. Yet, if it could be said that the vast distance that Evelina had spread between us had become slightly closer, I couldn\u2019t help but think it was a positive change.I recalled Evelina\u2019s voice from the morning.Four more days to go.\u201cIf Evelina fails to fulfill the conditions she imposed upon me within four days, I shall likely cease to exist within this mortal form. Thereafter, it remains uncertain whether Evelina shall return or whether she shall insert a new individual in her stead.\u201d\u201cI apologize, but I have no desire to narrow the distance that I have been endeavoring to bridge on my own accord. Therefore, I wished to defer the decision regarding the possessor of this body to the one who shall come after four days.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I felt I should express gratitude for her morning ritual that roused me like an alarm, even though it brought me displeasure. After sitting in a daze for a while, I finally managed to rise from my bed.I washed myself, dressed, and made preparations to commence the day\u2019s activities. Then, without delay, I proceeded straight to my study. There, I found today\u2019s agenda, which I had received before retiring for the night. As I scanned it from top to bottom, a bitter smile crept onto my face.\u201cAnother day filled with obligations.\u201dI did not voice a complaint. After all, each hour of this meticulously scheduled day was filled with tasks I myself had requested.Yesterday, after concluding my meeting with the prince, I had summoned the officials responsible for managing my schedule and made a request.\u201cI would appreciate it if you could further increase my workload for the foreseeable future.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dThe officials\u2019 faces became incredulous upon hearing my words.Over a year had passed since the Holy Maiden assumed her duties. During prayer meetings, I momentarily recalled the significance of her role and resumed my actions with renewed vigor. However, to think that I still yearned to work passionately even after the conclusion of these devotional gatherings?Such thoughts were clearly apparent.\u201cIs there nothing left for you to do?\u201d\u201cOh, no. That\u2019s not the case! Please wait a moment.\u201dHastily, they rushed out and returned with a new schedule. I accepted it and briefly perused its contents before inquiring further.\u201cThere are considerable gaps in the schedule. Why have they been left vacant?\u201d\u201cIt seemed that you might be in need of some rest\u2026\u201d\u201cThat won\u2019t be necessary. If there are any urgent matters, please schedule them during this time.\u201dLaughter appeared on the officials\u2019 faces upon my request to add more tasks to my agenda. However, as they continued to fill every available slot with new engagements, their expressions turned ashen. I sensed the reason behind this shift.\u201cDo you fear the prospect of arranging and subsequently cancelling these scheduled events\u2026 is that what you are thinking?\u201d\u201cPardon? Oh\u2026 no!\u201dWell, perhaps they were right. The officials desperately attempted to regain their composure, but it was already too late.The reason behind their hurriedly filling every moment of my schedule was a singular one: they wished to have me engage in activities Evelina despised. Strangely enough, she disliked me performing the duties of the Holy Maiden. It was as if she wished to prevent the erosion of her infamous reputation that had accumulated over time.While contemplating this, I muttered under my breath, gazing at the newly arranged agenda from yesterday.\u201cRebellion, indeed.\u201dThe displeasing chuckle I heard in the morning resurfaced in my thoughts. Alongside it, I recalled Evelina\u2019s face as I had seen it in my dreams. She had worn an expression of keen interest upon beholding me\u2014a countenance akin to that of a child who had obtained a fascinating toy. The only difference was that her face brimmed with an overwhelming desire to break that toy.Evelina despises me.To be precise, she detests my lack of initiative, just as I had conjectured.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even care.\u201dIf she dislikes me, it would be preferable for her to expel me from this body sooner, allowing me to do as I please.\u201cIs this endeavor truly amusing?\u201dIt was not difficult to imagine what Evelina expected of me. She must have wanted to witness my desperate quest for a man to spend the night with, fearing the loss of her hold over me. She would have relished observing my attempts to find a man, while uttering words of enticement and asking him to share the bed with her.\u201cI refuse to be swayed.\u201dThe thought of leaving this body terrified me. Yet, the more I pondered, the greater the anger towards Evelina grew, surpassing my fear.\u201cI have no desire to move according to her whims.\u201dThis body has always belonged to her. So even if she were to reclaim it, I would have no right to object. I tried my best to contain my emotions, urging myself not to feel aggrieved or afraid. In doing so, anger was all that remained within me\u2014a rage directed at the woman who was shaking me to my core.However, that did not make the tasks I could undertake any remarkable. I merely timidly engaged in actions Evelina disapproved of, showing her that unlike you, I am capable of such things. And in the end, I would express my gratitude for briefly experiencing a different life before vanishing. That\u2019s what I wanted.\u201cBut\u2026\u201dMy body trembled slightly.Perhaps, on the final day, I would come to regret my choices. No, I would undoubtedly regret them. Because of my foolish vanity, I would endure, even to the point of death, refusing to succumb to Evelina\u2019s demand to bring anyone to bed.Once again, I glanced at the itinerary. I did not wish to entertain any thoughts. With such a busy schedule, it was certain that I could avoid them.***\u201cI suppose you could take a little break,\u201d whispered the neighboring official cautiously, observing the long gaze into the papers.\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d came the reply, without lifting the head, and soon the voice echoed again.\u201cI must admit, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen you like this\u2026 Ah!\u201dThe official hurriedly covered their mouth with their hand. Their astonishment was evident, as if saying, \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve witnessed such behavior.\u2019\u201dUnable to hear anything, the official signed the documents handed to them, casting a quick glance and bowing in farewell before swiftly leaving the study.With a bitter smile, I turned my head to the side, where there were papers that needed urgent attention.\u201cIt must be about the Deputy Official candidate.\u201dThe current Deputy Official was in poor health, making mobility difficult. That must be why, even during prayer meetings, another senior official temporarily took over the Deputy Official\u2019s duties.\u201cIs this the list of candidates?\u201dAs I skimmed through the names written on the paper, one name caught my eye.Carl.In an instant, a sinking feeling enveloped my heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My vision turned white, and nothing came into focus. The only thing visible was the name Carl. My heart thumped heavily, and cold sweat trickled down my body. When I saw my trembling hands, I knew. It wasn\u2019t my own reaction; it was Evelina\u2019s response.Taking slow breaths, I moved my body. Fortunately, with some time, my vision gradually returned, and the pounding in my chest subsided. Calming myself, I looked at the paper once again.\u201cWho is this Carl, causing such a fuss?\u201dI searched Evelina\u2019s memories, but naturally, there were no recollections of that name. However, it felt different from when I had no memories of Karus. It seemed like a memory beyond a massive wall, something I could never approach.Once the trembling ceased, I looked through the list from the top again.\u201cShall I call for the official who brought this document?\u201dAs soon as I made the request, a mild-mannered senior official entered the study. He was one of the high-ranking officials I had met several times while preparing for the prayer meeting. With the usual formal greetings, he respectfully lowered his head. Then, with a concerned tone, he asked,\u201cI heard you called me regarding the candidate list?\u201d\u201cYes, it seems the list I received before the prayer meeting differs slightly.\u201dWhen I urgently received the list of deputy officials, there was clearly no name Carl on it.\u201cAh, at that time, as the prayer meeting was approaching, I only forwarded the list of officials present in the headquarters who met the requirements. This time, I included the names of qualified individuals from the regional temples as well.\u201dUnderstanding why more names had been added, I also realized why the senior official was looking at me with worried eyes.\u201cThere must be plenty of people Evelina dislikes.\u201dEvelina had sent all the senior officials who spoke respectfully to her to temples far away. Among them were many officials who received great respect and love, even if their ranks were not high. Perhaps all of those individuals had their names added to the list.\u201cIs there a particular official you favor?\u201d\u201cNot exactly\u2026\u201dAs I answered, I gazed at the name Carl once again. Then, the senior official, understanding where my gaze fell, smiled warmly.\u201cDo you hold a favorable opinion of Official Carl? Well, if it\u2019s him, he is more than capable of filling the position of a deputy. Although his youth might be an issue, I believe Carl will be able to handle it.\u201dThe senior official\u2019s voice carried an absolute trust in Carl.\u201cPerhaps it would be acceptable for Carl, as a deputy official, to return to the headquarters gradually during this opportunity. After all, he is the official whom the Holy Maiden has followed since childhood. Even if Carl himself chose to go to a temple in a remote land, it would be appropriate to invite him back now, don\u2019t you think? If it\u2019s an issue, I don\u2019t think they would refuse to release Carl from that temple.\u201dThe senior official spoke with laughter, exuding longing and trust for that person. Captivated by his expression, I looked at the list again.\u201cWho on earth is he?\u201dEven though he was someone Evelina had followed, could he really receive such high praise? I couldn\u2019t believe it. Thinking about the individuals Evelina had kept by her side, they were mostly mediocre people at best, like Karus. Yet, here was a different senior official showering praise on someone. I was curious about this person.\u201cFor now, I understand. You may go.\u201dUpon hearing that, the senior official bowed and withdrew from the study. In the quietness that returned, I stared at the name Carl countless times. Then, my gaze moved to my hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dI saw the hand gripping the document tightly. As I slowly opened my clenched fist, sweaty palm revealed itself.\u201cWhy is this happening?\u201dWho on earth is Carl that Evelina would react this way? It must be related to those three circular marks inside my thigh. I felt a pulsating sensation. Not on those marks, but in my chest. At that moment, instinctively, I knew that Carl, the official, had a connection with those marksPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 45": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Fake Saintess Awaits Her ExitCH 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTwo days left.Today, just like clockwork, I heard Evelina\u2019s voice. However, there was a difference compared to yesterday. Evelina\u2019s voice lacked its usual laughter. Moreover, there was a sense of restlessness in her tone. It seemed she couldn\u2019t understand why I was behaving so nonchalantly, and there was a tinge of annoyance in her voice.Thanks to that, my mood improved a bit. Perhaps tomorrow, I would have to use stronger words, so I needed to mentally prepare myself.\u201cBut\u2026 no mention of Carl.\u201dIn the dream, she had clearly said she could see everything inside me. So, I thought she would say something about Carl, the person who had shown a strong physical reaction when he saw the name written on the document. I thought she would either ask me to bring him or tell me to remove his name from the list immediately. I didn\u2019t know which one it was, but I expected some kind of reaction. However, Evelina didn\u2019t say a word about it.Doubt suddenly crept in.\u201cCould she really be seeing everything?\u201dIf that were the case, she wouldn\u2019t be so quiet about it.After pondering for a moment, I rose from my seat. As I prepared and went out, many officials were waiting for me, just like every day. While looking at them, I realized that due to the busy day I had yesterday, I hadn\u2019t even thought about the conditions Evelina mentioned until I fell asleep.\u201cIt could happen again today.\u201dWith so much work piled up, just handling it would consume another day. With that thought in mind, I looked at the numerous tasks on my desk. Among them, one caught my eye.It was an exquisitely elegant envelope. It wasn\u2019t merely its elegance that caught my attention. It had a large imperial seal stamped on it.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201dWithout realizing it, a muffled exclamation escaped my lips. When I turned the letter over, I saw the name I had been thinking about written on it.Leon.Just the name was written on the letter. In this world, it was written like this only when two people had an exceptionally close relationship. It could be family, an extremely close friend, or, even more so, a lover.Of course, my relationship with Prince Leon did not fall into any of those categories.As I examined the envelope, I found another strange thing. Compared to the other letter envelopes, it was noticeably thicker. I couldn\u2019t help but be curious about what could be inside. Eventually, unable to resist my curiosity, I broke the wax seal.\u201cWhat is all this?\u201dFirst and foremost, I saw a thick letter. It seemed like something was tucked between the sheets of the letter, so I took it out of the envelope. To my surprise, it poured out like a stream of red, round objects. As I examined what they were, I sighed.\u201cFlower petals?\u201dIf they were just flower petals, they would have had a faint scent of grass. But when I picked one up and held it to my nose, I could smell a rich fragrance. It seemed like these were specially treated flower petals for some particular purpose.\u201cThis is chaos.\u201dLooking at my desk that had suddenly turned into a flower garden, I unfolded the thick piece of paper.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAnd I was left speechless. The letter that began with \u201cDearest\u201d went on for more than ten pages. I quickly flipped through and reached the end. As expected, there it was. The form of address that referred to me had changed from \u201cSaint\u201d to Evelina. I went back to the beginning of the letter and started reading it again. I just wanted to see what the prince had written.After a while, I set down the last page of the letter.\u201cInteresting.\u201dIt was unexpected. With the intention of seeing what nonsense was being spoken, I began reading, and before I knew it, I was engrossed in the letter. What had started as a simple greeting now filled the pages with humorous anecdotes about his recent visit and the mundane occurrences of my surroundings.It felt as if I were reading an entertaining novel rather than a letter. So when I reached the final chapter, a sense of disappointment washed over me, as if it had already come to an end.Having compiled the letter, I reflected upon Prince Leon.\u201cThey say he possesses remarkable skills in dealing with people.\u201dThere was quite a bit written about him in the book as well. Among the male protagonists, he was the one with the most captivating charm towards women. I remember finding it quite amusing to read about his infatuation and pitiful state when it came to Iris.\u201cYet, it was the absence of a successor that terrified him more.\u201dDespite his numerous encounters and affairs with countless women, the prince had no legitimate or illegitimate child.\u201cHe must have been quite a meticulous individual.\u201dAlthough briefly mentioned and swiftly dismissed, it seemed he was the type to ensure there were no rumors or ill words following any romantic involvements.In that moment, a thought crossed my mind.\u201cWhat if I were to engage in a relationship with Prince Leon?\u201dIf by doing so, I could fulfill Evelina\u2019s conditions and continue to survive in this body, perhaps when Iris appeared and I eventually left the temple, he would be somewhat lenient. As long as I did not torment Iris and refrained from mentioning any previous liaisons with him, he wouldn\u2019t resort to burning me at the stake.Lost in such contemplation, I raised my head.\u201cLet us finish what we started.\u201dOnce again, I placed the paper into the envelope and gathered all the petals that adorned the desk, tucking them away in the same envelope. Today, Prince Leon would receive a letter not so different from the one he received yesterday.***Leon was agitated. He had already inquired of his subordinates over ten times today, repeating the same question again.\u201cHas a response not arrived?\u201d he asked once more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yesterday, around this time, he had received a reply from the Saint, but today, there had been no communication whatsoever. Could it be that he would receive a response different from yesterday? With that thought in mind, Leon spun around the room. The anticipation of an uncertain outcome brought him joy.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a while since I felt this way.\u201dLeon was experiencing the realization that he was indeed a prince. He was not free from his status within the palace.\u201cDid I reveal too much?\u201dInterrupting his murmurs, the officials promptly interjected.\u201cWe definitely tried to dissuade you.\u201dThey had indeed done their utmost to dissuade Leon. Once his status became known, concerns about security arose immediately. This was the Grand Temple, where only the knights sworn to the temple and devoted to the gods were allowed to shed blood and protect.However, that did not mean there were no conflicts. Numerous countries on the continent were still engaged in wars of various scales. Key figures from each country resided in the Grand Temple to seek treatment for the wounds they suffered in those wars. A significant portion of these individuals harbored deep animosity towards the Empire.But for a prince to suddenly appear in the Grand Temple, something had to be amiss. Indeed, from the moment news of Leon\u2019s presence among the Imperial envoys reached their ears, suspicious guests had increased during the nights.\u201cWell, he won\u2019t be an easy target\u2026\u201dKnowing this fact brought some comfort to the officials\u2019 restless hearts. The Emperor, who had rolled and tumbled on the battlefield, could not have raised his son to be weak. Even if he couldn\u2019t hear the sound of ultimate strength, Leon possessed the ability to stand against most knights. Thanks to this, the officials had the opportunity to witness the prince murmuring to himself, \u201cI don\u2019t think I brought a reply\u2026\u201d as he stabbed the nocturnal guests who arrived before they could make a move.\u201cI\u2019m going out.\u201d\u201cWhere are you going?\u201dEveryone was startled when the prince suddenly appeared at the door. They had expected him to wait for the uncertain response from the Saint. However, Leon replied with a sense of urgency.\u201cI can\u2019t just keep waiting.\u201dThe prince\u2019s face looked remarkably elated as he spoke. With no wars to occupy his time for a while, Leon had to spend quiet hours within the palace. The passionate love affair had consumed his attention for a while before suddenly coming to an end, as if it were a lie. It seemed that this time, he had chosen the Saint as his conquest.Ignoring the officials\u2019 protests, Leon\u2019s gaze narrowed as he strode down the corridor.\u201cI have tasks to fulfill as well.\u201dApart from his growing interest in the Saint, there were other matters he had to attend to. One of them was to learn more about Latvan, the commander of the Temple Knights.When he realized that the Grand Temple had become an obstacle to the Empire, the first method that crossed his mind was to subdue it through force.The Imperial army was specialized in conquering battles. Their numbers surpassed those of any other nation, and there was no doubt that they could overwhelm the Grand Temple, which was merely the size of a city.\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible.\u201dThe Empire couldn\u2019t subdue the Grand Temple, all because of the Saint. Possessing the strongest powers and protecting the continent from demonic forces, the Saint could create a protective barrier that repelled external attacks. If the Saint were to wield her powers within the self-sufficient fortress-like Grand Temple, the Imperial army would forever remain on the outside, merely spectators.\u201cAnd even if we were to engage, we would have to endure significant losses\u2026\u201dThe Temple possessed the Saint, the ultimate shield. However, that did not mean they were without a sword.The Temple Knights were the most formidable order, facing off against the continent\u2019s demonic forces. Their leader, Latvan, was someone whom all knights on the continent revered and aspired to face in battle at least once.A few years ago, a colossal demonic force known as Heberon appeared at the edge of the continent. It was one of the demons sealed away by the first Saint, a long time ago.Heberon wreaked havoc, devastating dozens of villages as it made its way into the continent. Faced with its aggression, all nations on the continent held their breath, wishing to kill it as quickly as possible. At that time, while the defenseless villages waited for death, Latvan was the first to charge toward Heberon.\u201cAnd he defeated it.\u201dThe valiant knight was a legend, but he had always been remembered as the one who rushed headlong toward Heberon.A solitary knight vanquished the legendary demon, and with that, the name of Latvan spread throughout the entire continent, earning the respect of all.But what would happen if Latvan\u2019s Order of Sacred Knights clashed with the Imperial Knights? Even if the numbers favored them, it was easy to anticipate that the main force of the Imperial Knights would suffer devastating losses.If they were to suffer such losses and submit to the Grand Temple, what would come next?Every other nation would seize the opportunity and rise simultaneously, claiming to have found a just cause. The Empire, having suffered substantial casualties, would be unable to emerge victorious against dozens of nations.\u201cIt\u2019s not like everyone\u2019s foolish enough to leave the Grand Temple untouched.\u201dLeon knew well that there had been countless attempts in the past to subjugate the Grand Temple, all of which had ended in failure.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, we\u2019ll have to bring it down from within\u2026\u201dThe power that upholds the Grand Temple is twofold.The first is the spiritual force embodied by the High Priestess herself. The second is the unwavering faith that all people on the continent hold towards the High Priestess and the Grand Temple. It has remained steadfast for thousands of years. However, this time is different.When the 49th High Priestess, Evelina, ascended to her position, she was hailed by all as a revered figure. Her beautiful appearance captivated everyone\u2019s gaze, and her unwavering belief in the gods earned her respect. And her constant efforts as the High Priestess. However, it didn\u2019t last long. Soon, all sorts of derogatory epithets were attached to Evelina\u2019s name.\u201cThis is an opportunity.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Among the numerous High Priestesses in the long history of the Grand Temple, Evelina was the first to be so unbecoming of her sacred position. Consequently, the Grand Temple was at a loss as to how to handle her whims and caprices.\u201cIt seems like our planted individuals are diligently doing their work as well.\u201dThe events that transpired during the prayer meeting would spread maliciously throughout the continent. The individuals planted by the Empire would amplify the events of that day, turning Evelina into an unparalleled villainess in the world.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for two suns in the sky.\u201dIf there are two, you just need to pull one down. Leon approached the window and gazed at the Grand Temple. This magnificent city and fortress, he wanted to leave it under the Empire\u2019s feet as long as he was alive, no matter what happened.\u201cIf only it were just another country, things wouldn\u2019t be so complicated.\u201dAs he gazed at the Grand Temple, he absentmindedly muttered those words. His mother came to his mind. She was the princess of the country that had resisted to the very end while his father continued his conquests. The unification of the two countries had been accomplished through a simple method called marriage.Though it was a bit different from the traditional marriage proposal, which involved a treasure-filled box, as it involved the throats of war captives.\u201cIf only we could absorb the Grand Temple in such a manner.\u201dLost in his thoughts, Leon stroked his chin.\u201cCan a High Priestess get married?\u201dNow that he thought about it, there were no conditions related to physical purity among the requirements for the High Priestess. So perhaps Evelina could continue to hold her position as the High Priestess while indulging in such activities with men.\u201cShould I give it a try?\u201dWhile there was a need to learn more about the regulations of the Grand Temple, he had never heard of any rules prohibiting the High Priestess from getting married. Leon\u2019s footsteps quickened as he walked down the corridor once again. And there, at the end of the corridor, he encountered the person he had been seeking. Latvan stood there.\u201cAh, what a coincidence. I was actually planning to go see you, Your Grace. It seems that the gods are looking after me.\u201dWith a smile on his face, Leon approached Latvan but halted his steps as he saw the hostile gaze in Latvan\u2019s eyes.***\u201cYou have returned!\u201dAs Latvan stepped into the knights\u2019 hall, the knights stationed at the entrance swiftly saluted him. Though his presence was always commanding, his current vigor made his voice resonate throughout the surroundings. After acknowledging their salute with a slight nod, Latvan promptly turned his body and vanished into the corridor.[Phew]The knights who had saluted him breathed a sigh of relief, lowering their hands.Entering his chamber, Latvan went straight to his desk and sat down. Then, he roughly ran his hand through his dishevelled hair. His previously neat and tidy locks became a mess in his hand.\u201cWhy did I do that?\u201dHe questioned himself. He couldn\u2019t fathom why he had revealed his animosity towards Prince Leon. There were certainly ample reasons for him to dislike the prince. Leon was someone who didn\u2019t hide his ambition for the throne. Given Latvan\u2019s duty to protect the royal palace, it was only natural for him to despise such a person.How could he face someone with a sword, ready to strike at the royal palace, with a smile if the opportunity arose? Nevertheless, Latvan was present at the palace as a guest, so he had to treat the prince with respect due to a visitor. Regardless of his feelings towards Prince Leon, he had to receive him as a guest of the palace.As Latvan pondered why he disliked Leon so much, a scene flashed through his mind. When the imperial envoy met the saint, the prince kissed the back of her hand. While others may not have noticed, Latvan could easily discern the prince\u2019s intentions. It was not a mere gesture of respect. It was evident that the prince\u2019s tongue had lasciviously grazed the back of the saint\u2019s hand. Such behavior reminded Latvan of the countless rumors surrounding the prince. Despite his indifference to gossip, he was well aware of the prince\u2019s inclinations towards women.\u201cHe hasn\u2019t even managed to correct that habit within the palace walls.\u201dSince then, Latvan had paid even closer attention to the saint\u2019s safety. Fortunately, she seemed to have heeded his advice and refrained from summoning the prince.\u201cFortunately?\u201dLatvan was startled by his own thoughts. Why did he consider it fortunate that the saint hadn\u2019t met with him?Strange. Recently, he had been plagued by incomprehensible thoughts. When did it all start?His eyes drifted towards a coat hanging in a corner of the room.There, still crumpled, hung a ceremonial cloak that hadn\u2019t been properly cared for.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had become rigid and cold. Consequently, her voice sounded somewhat like that of a worried person. It was astonishing. The one being threatened here was not Evelina, but rather myself. If anyone were to listen, they would think Evelina was being threatened by me.\u201cIt\u2019s the end,\u201d I said.With that thought in mind, it wasn\u2019t easy to rise. The morning sunlight pouring in through the window was dazzling, and the chirping of busy birds filled the air. Lost in the idea of it being the end, I closed my eyes and leisurely savored these sights and sounds. Today was just like yesterday. And there would be no tomorrow.I lay on the bed, closing my eyes for a long time, barely preparing myself to get up.After a while, dressed in simple attire, I entered the study. Familiar attendants, who had become quite recognizable, were waiting for me as if it were only natural, holding documents in their hands.It has been a few days since I began this work. When I revealed my presence, they lowered their heads and greeted me.\u201cGood morning,\u201d I said.As soon as I greeted them, all sorts of documents piled up on the desk. The attendants, standing beside me, raised their voices, saying it was their turn first, and then they promptly formed a line, waiting for their turn. First, I quickly inspected the first document.After a while, when the signing was done, I handed over the completed document, and the attendant who received it spoke with a bright face.\u201cThen, I will bring the remaining parts tomorrow. Please take care tomorrow as well!\u201dWith a smile, he bowed and soon left the study. As I watched the departing figure of the joyful attendant, I let out a bitter smile.\u201cTomorrow,\u201d I thought.Tomorrow, I might not be here. I strained to hold back the words I wanted to say. Suddenly, I became curious. Who will be sitting here tomorrow? The original Evelina? Or a newly inserted soul other than myself?Then I remembered the attendant who had turned back a while ago. He seemed so delighted, expecting that he would be able to complete the remaining work tomorrow.A feeling of pity washed over me.Perhaps he had developed affection for this place. I looked around the study. It was an immensely spacious area. Behind me were shelves akin to a library, and on the opposite side, another desk was piled with work-related documents. Now, on a chair placed against one of the walls, attendants sat, waiting for their turn, engaging in conversations about the tasks at hand.\u201cWhy did I work so diligently?\u201d I wondered.Evelina, whom I met in a dream, had said those words to me.\u201cI\u2019ve dreamt of this.\u201dLying in a hospital bed, browsing through people\u2019s everyday lives on a social media app, what I envied the most was not something extraordinary. It was chatting with friends, going to beautiful places, or going to eat delicious food. Among them, strangely enough, what I envied the most was seeing a post with a takeaway cup in hand, captioned, \u201cLet\u2019s keep going today!\u201dEach day may not be easy, but the recognition I received for doing my share of work. That was what I envied the most.\u201cSo, I worked diligently.\u201dMoreover, I had become excited about enjoying even those aspects in this newfound life. Although the desire to change the contents of the novel was a reason to live differently, the truth was, my greed for such things was even greater.***\u201cIs this the end?\u201d she asked, as my plan to live busily until the very last moment, without entertaining any other thoughts, turned into mere froth with those words. One of the many items on my filled schedule had been cancelled due to insufficient preparation.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s find something else to do. It wouldn\u2019t hurt to get a head start on tomorrow\u2019s tasks,\u201d I suggested.\u201cNo, it would be best for you to rest now,\u201d the officials quickly intervened, extending their hands to stop me. Without uttering a word among themselves, they swiftly collected the documents from my desk and hastily exited. The other officials, observing their actions, nodded and spoke.\u201cIt would be troublesome if you exhaust yourself by overworking all at once.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since it has been a short time since you last fainted and the exact cause is still unclear, it would be wise to take some more rest.\u201dTheir words left me bewildered.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no need for this.\u201dBut when I regained my senses, I found myself back in my room. Dinner, which had been prepared earlier than usual, displayed on the table with a dazzling array of dishes. I sat down and, with the thought that this might be my final supper, my hand moved slowly. Like a condemned prisoner savoring their last meal, I tasted every dish without leaving a single one untouched. Even though I intentionally ate the food slowly, by the time I returned to my room, the sun had finally set.\u201cWe shall take our leave now. Rest well,\u201d they said as the door closed, and the room fell into silence. Alone, I climbed onto the bed, cradling my knees and burying my face.How much time is left until the end of today?\u201cIs Evelina beckoning from the other side of consciousness again? Would people perceive it as if I had lost my mind?\u201d I pondered.The thoughts continued to flow.\u201cGiven Evelina\u2019s personality, it seems like she would speak to me right now. Asking if I haven\u2019t changed my mind yet. Saying that I could just grab anyone passing by and beg for a night\u2019s shelter. Contrary to my expectation of being teased like that, Evelina hasn\u2019t spoken to me except when she woke up in the morning.\u201d\u201cCome to think of it, she claims to be a saint, yet she has never properly utilized her powers.\u201dApart from the automatic activation of her powers when opening the secret passage, I couldn\u2019t recall a time when she had consciously used her powers. No, there was one more occasion.Quietly, I lifted my nightgown, revealing three circular marks on my thigh.\u201cI wonder what this is.\u201dSomeone had deliberately left those marks. It was neither an appropriate place to show them nor did Evelina have any memories related to them, preventing me from guessing their origin. When I first discovered and touched them, the powers briefly glowed.\u201cIt felt as though this needed healing.\u201dThe powers seemed to radiate as if urging me to heal and erase them. But even if I had tried, I couldn\u2019t heal my own body, so it would have been futile. There were many other things that intrigued me as well. Questions such as who the official named Karl was, and why I had no memories of following him. Those were the things that kept me wondering for a long time until I buried my face again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I began to feel unjust.\u201cWhy does Evelina live like this?\u201dIn the past few weeks, I reminisced about the changes that occurred after I entered Evelina\u2019s body. Despite my numerous abhorrent actions, simply because I had been diligent and kind lately, the officials at the Grand Temple showed me an extraordinarily friendly attitude. While I felt a sense of pride witnessing their behavior, I also harbored a simultaneous resentment towards Evelina.This world is kind to Evelina. It is a world filled with people who would gladly return the favor and go above and beyond when Evelina, the saint, extends her hand. But why does Evelina trample upon all of that herself?\u201cBecause it\u2019s too obvious?\u201dShe was a young girl who had become a saint. Was it because she had grown accustomed to the world being kind to her? Such thoughts only intensified Evelina\u2019s dislike.With her beautiful appearance and saintly qualities, she ascended to the position of a saint and received the love of everyone. Yet she easily cast aside what I possessed.\u201cBut surely you thought everyone liked you.\u201dA sense of unease rose within me once again. If only Evelina were here, I wanted to whisper to her. Soon, you will lose everything you have. You will die. Yet you still don\u2019t appreciate what you possess.Rising from my seat, I contemplated all of this.\u201cThis is why I wished to be busy\u2026\u201dWhen I am alone, I am plagued by such dark and wicked thoughts. It is like when I was in the hospital, seeking out those who were more unfortunate than myself while reading books. It reveals the depths of my base and pitiful nature.\u201cI detest it.\u201dI did not want my final moments to be consumed by such thoughts. I immediately opened the door to the room. In the corridor, I saw the attendants who had been guarding the door all day.\u201cYour Highness? Is something bothering you?\u201dIgnoring their words, I walked away.\u201cYour Highness? Your attire\u2026\u201dAs I strolled down the corridor in my nightgown, they hurriedly followed.\u201cDo not follow me.\u201d\u201cWhat? But\u2026\u201d\u201cI said, do not follow me!\u201dShouting harshly, I startled them into frozen stillness. Leaving them behind, I ran down the corridor.***[Heh\u2026 heh\u2026]Breath escaped me, rising up to my throat. I leaned against the cold wall, carefully regulating my breathing. The exhaled breath carried a hint of odor, a reminder of the madness I had just sprinted through. Yet, even that was welcome. Every moment experienced with a healthy body was precious.The final moments of life flashed before my eyes. The deafening darkness that enveloped me, accompanied by the mechanical sound of a beep. A perfect void where nothing could be heard.\u201cI hate it. It\u2019s terrifying.\u201dJust the thought alone made my body tremble. The fear I had desperately avoided surged back. That\u2019s when I heard the sound of a bell from a distant temple tower. Counting the chimes, I held my breath.\u201cOne hour left.\u201dNow, I only had one hour left today. Once midnight struck, the life I had gained as a bonus would come to an end.\u201cEvalina.\u201dUnconsciously, I found her.\u201cI want to live a little longer.\u201dI want to keep living like this. I want to remain in this body a bit longer. If only Evalina would give it to me, without any hesitation or indifference towards my life. Then I could cherish it more than anyone else, even if Evalina didn\u2019t desire it.There is a way, you know.It wasn\u2019t Evalina\u2019s voice, but my own voice echoing in my mind.Yes, there was a way. The condition she had set for me. The condition that allowed me to spend a night with any man, no matter who. Why did I say that it wouldn\u2019t be something extraordinary?I turned around. It could be anyone. Just anyone, the first man I saw.\u201cYour Grace?\u201dThen, a voice called me from behind. When I turned, Prince Leon was looking at me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The corridor where we now stood was rarely used, with no artificial light except for the moonlight streaming in through the windows. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to question why he was here in a place like this at the moment.\u201cSurely, you didn\u2019t come all the way here to inspect the servants of the gods,\u201d she said, playfully.He came closer and his expression hardened after a brief silence. It was understandable. A princess dressed in a single nightgown and barefoot, weeping in a secluded place with rare visitors.After a moment of contemplation, he spoke again. \u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, how about we indulge in the dessert we couldn\u2019t share last time? My private chambers are wonderfully quiet and suitable for conversation, I believe.\u201dAs he spoke, he politely extended his arm. It was a gesture indicating that he would escort me if I agreed. I gazed at him, reminiscing about the letters he had sent over the past few days.\u201cWith this person\u2026\u201dEven if he proposed spending the night together at this very moment, I would never refuse. I took his outstretched arm. Now, I need this man.\u201cThen, allow me to escort you to my chambers\u2026\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cPardon?\u201dI held onto his arm tightly and quickly walked down the corridor. Soon, the corridor turned, and there were several doors along the way. When I opened the nearest one, it revealed an empty room with only minimal furnishings. This building was originally meant to accommodate guests who came to substitute for the absent prince. As the prayer ceremony had just ended and most of the envoys had returned, there were many empty spaces.I pulled him into the room and closed the door. The prince looked at me with surprise in his eyes. Without turning back, I tightly closed my eyes, and then I fervently spoke.\u201cSleep with me.\u201d\u201cPardon? What are you\u2026\u201d\u201cI said sleep with me. Do you object?\u201dIn an instant, his face turned red as if he were spewing fire. I had never imagined uttering such words to a man who had barely engaged in a few conversations with me. Moreover, it was as if I were pressuring him.But now, I couldn\u2019t afford to feel ashamed of such things.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to, say so. Then\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat will you do?\u201dHe suddenly approached, grabbing my wrist, and pulled me towards him. Taken aback, my body lost balance and swayed, falling into his embrace. Through his clothes, I could sense his solid physique, accompanied by a deep fragrance.\u201cIf I were to refuse, would you go outside again and search for someone else?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe did not respond. There was no need to respond. Then, the prince spoke again.\u201cI have heard rumors, but I never expected you to be so audacious. In fact\u2026\u201d\u201cYou talk too much.\u201dI interrupted his words. I had no time for leisurely conversation right now. I pushed him away and turned my body towards the door. What I needed now was not a conversation.[Thud!]With a rough sound, my body spun around. When I regained her senses, I found myself once again in the prince\u2019s embrace.\u201cI apologize for not understanding your urgency. If that\u2019s what you desire.\u201dSaying so, the prince bowed his head and immediately his lips covered hers. Between colliding lips, his tongue swiftly intruded.[Umph!]The sound of a probing tongue roughening echoed. Like a famished beast, his tongue explored every nook and cranny of her tender flesh. It pressed firmly, as if to confirm. Then, it pierced her throat.[Huh! Ugh!]I struggled in his embrace, pushing him away, unable to catch my breath. Yet, the Crown Prince remained motionless, as if finding amusement in my whimpering. He wrapped his hand around the back of my head, pulling me closer, and pressed his lips fervently against mine. I quickly grew breathless, surrendering to his every desire without even closing my violated mouth.My strength waned rapidly. The books had depicted the act of kissing as something beautiful and tender, an exchange of emotions between two souls. But the reality was far from that. It was an onslaught, a forceful intrusion, devoid of any emotions. All I felt from him now was desire.\u201cAh!\u201dWhile I clung to him, gasping for air, a sharp pain shot through my chest. Unbeknownst to me, the Crown Prince\u2019s hand had ascended, covering my entire chest in a tight grip.\u201cStop\u2026\u201dAt my plea, his hand retreated. I felt a faint ache in my released chest, accompanied by a tingling sensation in my lower abdomen. Soon, his hand returned, but this time, it caressed me slowly and gently, unlike the previous aggression.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

My legs grew weaker, struggling to hold me up. Finally, when his tongue penetrated deep into my mouth, I succumbed, collapsing under the overwhelming assault.\u201cOh dear.\u201dWith a laughter-tinged voice, he grasped my waist as I fell. His palm glided gently across my flattened belly, as if claiming ownership of this territory. The sensation sent shivers down my spine, as if foretelling what awaited me in this place.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you have quite an experience\u2026\u201dHis unexpected words made my body tremble. Had he misinterpreted my movements? He hastily spoke again.\u201cApologies for my presumption. I was merely surprised by your sensitivity.\u201d\u201cFine. Just hurry\u2026\u201dAll I could think about was the need to proceed quickly.\u201cEven with such trembling, you urge me on. Truly.\u201dAfter saying that, he lifted my waist with both hands and placed me gently on the nearby bed. He climbed on top of me, enclosing me in his arms, bringing his body close. His lips parted, and without hesitation, he seized my breast forcefully.\u201cHa!\u201dA moist and hot sensation seeped through the thin fabric. As he licked my nipple repeatedly, it rose above the wet cloth. He seemed to be waiting for that moment, as he playfully tugged on it.\u201cUh, ugh! Stop, please!\u201dEvery time he did so, a rough breath escaped my mouth.Good heavens. It felt as if my mind were melting away. Everything gradually faded away as I experienced a sensation I had never known before.After tormenting my breasts for a while, he lifted his face. The composed expression he had worn before entering this room was now absent from his features. Overflowing with excitement, he mounted me like a beast ready to devour its prey.\u201cI thought it would be delicious.\u201dWith those words, he pressed his finger firmly against my nipple.\u201cIt tastes even better than I expected.\u201d\u201cAh, black!\u201dIt felt as if a lightning bolt struck my forehead. My body quivered under his, just like a fish on dry land. With a sense of delight, he extended his hand toward my chest.His long fingers fearlessly removed my thin nightgown. In the moonlight streaming through the window, my white breasts were revealed. He gently grasped both mounds, treating them with reverence. Then, the tip of his finger began to explore the peaks.\u201cAh, aah! Stop touching my\u2026 my breasts!\u201dMy plea was cruelly ignored. Instead, he firmly grasped both peaks with his two fingers and quickly stimulated them. At that moment, a sensation of something flowing between my legs became apparent. A dizzying mixture of pleasure and pain pounded through my body. His lips descended, tracing my throat, while the hand that had caressed my breasts began to descend slowly.\u201cWell, it seems the Holy Maiden is more eager for this than for her breasts.\u201dHis hand slid over my belly button and slipped beneath my undergarments as smoothly as an eel. The hand, which had been wandering through the forest above, confidently covered the territory below. His palm, in its entirety, caressed my mound slowly. In an instant, my mind turned white with a rush of embarrassment and shame.The hand, though leisurely, exerted pressure from below, only to halt its movement with a mere breath.\u201cAh!\u201dHis finger pierced into me.\u201cOh, ah!\u201dMy lips involuntarily parted as I experienced a sensation deep within me for the first time. All my senses erupted from below. Unbeknownst to me, my toes curled involuntarily. Good heavens. Fear washed over me in torrents. What am I doing? What has entered my body?His finger moved swiftly, sweeping against my inner walls. With each stroke, my hips jolted and my waist arched reflexively. I wanted to beg him to stop immediately, but all that escaped my lips were stifled moans, and I found myself incapable of uttering any other words.\u201cDid you request a quick completion?\u201d\u201cUh, yes!\u201dAs his finger retreated from within me, I heard the sound of him removing his clothes. Simultaneously, coarse breaths mingled with the sound of fabric being torn, accompanied by brief profanities. Just those sounds alone conveyed how consumed by lust the prince was at this moment.\u201cAllow me to satisfy you from below, first.\u201dAs soon as he uttered those words, a moan of satisfaction escaped my lips, and something trickled down from beneath my thigh. Raising my head, I looked at him. His eyes gleamed with the desire he had suppressed. His intense gaze swept over my body.Merely his gaze made me feel as though I had already succumbed to him. His body found its place between my legs. Then, he firmly grasped my waist with both hands, pulling me towards him. And then, something large and blunt made contact beneath the part that had opened up.\u201cAhh-hh!\u201dI gasped for air at the sudden overwhelming mass. The sensitive area pressed against it trembled uncontrollably. And in response, his member that rested below made a squelching sound as it pushed against me and glided upwards.Finally, reality hit me. I am now in the act of intertwining my body with a man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Her eyes, fixed upon his groin, seemed to express disbelief at the sight of his member resting against her nether regions, causing Leon to feel an even deeper ache within.\u201cDamn it,\u201d he muttered, suppressing the profanity that threatened to escape his lips. His throbbing desire was pressing insistently against the entrance, as if it were about to burst forth at any moment. Though only the tip grazed against her, the sanctum of the saint enveloped his endowment tenderly. As his flesh made contact with her moist, velvety folds, Leon couldn\u2019t help but feel a dizzying sensation he hadn\u2019t experienced in ages.His member, swollen with longing, released droplets of fluid in a steady rhythm, its engorged state resembling a restless creature, leaking saliva-like secretions.Just this touch alone was overwhelming. One could hardly fathom how incredible it would be to penetrate within. Leon yearned to thrust into her roughly, relentlessly, without any restraint, and to ravish her without hesitation. After all, wasn\u2019t it the saint who implored him to enter her eagerly?As Leon attempted to push himself inside, desperately restraining his urges, he looked once again at her. Something seemed amiss.\u201cAre you truly the infamous saint they speak of?\u201d he wondered aloud.From the moment their lips met, he sensed something peculiar. She was a woman who engaged in relations with dozens of men every night, so he naturally believed her to be skilled. However, instead of displaying proficiency, her eyes widened in surprise, as if taken aback when their tongues intertwined. And since then, she had been reduced to a motionless statue, incapable of responding to his kisses.Leon was familiar with such reactions. The saint, behaving like a woman who had never experienced such encounters, seemed more like someone desperately seeking to embrace a man. No, it wasn\u2019t merely desire; there was a sense of urgency emanating from her.He wondered if she had grown weary from excessive indulgence before and after her prayer meetings. To accommodate her requests, he had decided not to attach much significance to their intimate acts. However, when his hand firmly grasped her supple breasts, Leon couldn\u2019t help but entertain the thought of enjoying himself.Thus, despite her urging, he deliberately initiated their caresses slowly. As he mouthed her breasts, tormenting the nipples he could feel with the tip of his tongue, her quivering body pressed closer against him. He had no intention of holding back the thrust she yearned for. Widening his mouth, he filled it with her ivory bosom, voraciously devouring it. Applying force, he sucked it in greedily, causing her exquisite form to writhe beneath him.Her flawlessly smooth, white skin resembled powdered sugar, hinting at a sweet taste. He felt he could spend an entire day lapping at it, savoring its delectable essence. Another thought crossed his mind: how much more delicious would the fluid flowing from within taste?As he entertained that notion, his member throbbed with a pulsating ache. Leon lowered his hand to his groin, feeling the sensation of engorgement. It was already damp, as if soaked in a humid valley. He relaxed slightly upon this heightened stimulation, thinking how easily it became wet from such gentle provocation.\u201cI almost lost control,\u201d he murmured, stifling a laugh at his own clumsiness. Yet, unlike his acting skills, her body responded eagerly. At this rate, it seemed there would be little resistance to inserting himself.His hands, fumbling clumsily while attempting to remove their garments, slipped numerous times. Leon couldn\u2019t help but chuckle at his own clumsy actions. How amusing it was to witness a boy on the cusp of his first experience, unable to contain his excitement.\u201cMay I proceed now?\u201d he asked, drawing her trembling head close to him. The saint, still panting heavily, nodded weakly.\u201cYes, p-please\u2026 quickly\u2026\u201dWith approval, Leon no longer hesitated .His fully engorged member, throbbing with prominent veins, hovered just above her navel. Grasping himself with one hand, he positioned his manhood against her entrance. And with a forceful push, the moist sound of penetration filled the air, driving him to the brink of desperation. The saint\u2019s inner sanctum seemed to swallow him whole.\u201cAh, gods!\u201dI opened my eyes wide, arching my back in pain.\u201cIt\u2026 it hurts\u2026\u201dMy words caused Leon to pause momentarily. Could this be part of the act as well? However, the grip of his hand on the sheet beneath them turned white from the force exerted. How should he proceed? He whispered, attempting to calm her.\u201cThe entirety hasn\u2019t entered yet. Please, release a bit of tension.\u201dIn response, the saint stuttered as she spoke.\u201cH-how\u2026 how can I\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWhat on earth must I say to explain? Leon hesitated, keeping his body close without pulling away, and bowed his upper body. Then, he covered the trembling lips of the maiden. Unlike before, his tongue entered her mouth slowly. He playfully nibbled on her lower lip, careful not to cause any pain, and lightly tapped the inside of her mouth with his tongue.In response, the maiden\u2019s tongue cautiously wrapped around his. Leon raised his hand and held onto her shoulders. His hand, which had been gently caressing her heavily tensed shoulders, gradually moved down. Then, he firmly grasped the maiden\u2019s breasts, which had been soft and trembling beneath his touch.Once again, it was a leisurely movement. He grasped her tightly as if about to crush her, then gently released his grip. Next, he pressed his entire palm against her breasts, kneading them in a circular motion. As Leon repeated these actions, the tension in the maiden\u2019s body slowly dissipated. Then, as if completely accustomed to it, her body relaxed entirely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Instantly, the impact caused her mouth to open wide and her eyes to widen. Leon laughed and covered her lips. He didn\u2019t hesitate any longer and began moving his body.Squelching sounds reverberated from beneath them, accompanied by splashing water. The wooden bed, as if on the verge of breaking, made a threatening sound. They couldn\u2019t stop. His rationality had already disappeared the moment he delved into her depths.It was unbearably tight. And hot. Leon felt as if he was being devoured inside her, consumed by her. But it didn\u2019t matter. As long as he could continue experiencing this sensation, he would gladly be consumed.\u201cAh! Ugh! Hnnn!\u201dThe screams beneath their violent collision gradually turned into moans. As he penetrated deeper, the moans grew louder. Leon concentrated on that spot and continued thrusting. The intensifying voice pleased him greatly. He could listen to it for a lifetime if given the chance.Perhaps she was exhausted. Her weak hand that had risen without strength tried to push his shoulder away. Leon smiled and held onto her hand. Then, he tickled her palm with the tip of his tongue. Once again, her body beneath him writhed.\u201cHah, ugh! Uunh!\u201dHer cries only fueled his movements further. Their bodies, which had been moving madly for some time, suddenly jerked backward. Just as the glans was about to slip out, Leon forcefully pushed the maiden\u2019s body up.\u201cUngh!\u201dWith the sensation of penetrating her deepest depths, the maiden\u2019s body trembled. Leon held her tightly. Their bodies stuck together so closely that not even a piece of paper could fit between them. Leon\u2019s body shivered intensely. After a while, he slowly withdrew himself from her.How thoroughly had he exhausted himself? Milky semen plopped onto the sheets with a splattering sound. The maiden\u2019s mangled lower region leaked the untouched semen that she hadn\u2019t managed to swallow.Leon felt his eyes roll back, experiencing the meaning of that phrase.Dishevelled golden locks were scattered across the crumpled sheets. Tear-drenched blue eyes, still resonating with the aftermath of their lovemaking, were unfocused. Her ample breasts trembled gently, adorned with the marks he had taunted. The weak female form, spread open with exhaustion from accepting him. And the traces of his essence flowing out from within her.\u201cInsane\u2026\u201dLeon realized what he had done and uttered a rough sound.He had been intimate with countless women before. However, he had never released his seed inside a woman. No matter how entwined their bodies were, he had always adhered to his own rules.It wasn\u2019t that he couldn\u2019t bear it. It was what he had desired.He wanted to go deeper. He wanted to devour everything, including their breaths. He wanted to pour himself into this woman I was holding, without reservation. He hoped she would be drenched in his scent alone.***\u201cI feel as if I\u2019m about to perish.Only that thought occupied my mind. Just a moment ago, I had even contemplated whether I had already died. It was precisely from the moment the prince infiltrated my being. In an instant, everything turned pitch black, only to swiftly transform into a blinding whiteness. I felt as if my entire body was being torn apart. It was a terrifying pain, comparable to the sensation of a pillar engulfed in flames piercing through one\u2019s core.Sensing the violent tremors coursing through my body, I pursed my lips and uttered,\u201cWhy on earth is this happening?\u201dIn Evelina\u2019s memories that I had witnessed, she engaged in intimate relationships with men on a daily basis. I couldn\u2019t fathom why she willingly subjected herself to such agony day after day. Lost in those thoughts, Leon\u2019s touch pierced deep within me.\u201cMmm!\u201dAt that moment, I experienced an unfamiliar sensation. It felt as though an electric current surged through my entire body, causing a tingling sensation, and unknowingly, my toes curled in response.\u201cNo, this cannot be.\u201dInstinct screamed within me. I tried to push him away, but as if anticipating my resistance, the prince held onto me firmly. His body pressed tightly against mine, trembling noticeably. And moments later, he slowly withdrew his body. As what had previously filled me to the brim departed, an involuntary moan escaped my lips. The lukewarm substance trickled down my thigh.\u201cIs it over?\u201dIs this what it was supposed to be? Does this mean I can possess this body a little longer?Tears threatened to pour forth. They were tears of relief. Slowly, I lifted my body upright. Yet, the prince reached out his hand and embraced my waist.\u201c\u2026?\u201dBefore I could question his actions, his manhood swelled once again between my legs. Startled, I gazed at him, and he responded by pressing his lips against my cheek, as if it were only natural, and spoke,\u201cSurely, you didn\u2019t expect it to end with just one round.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Before I could retort, his lips met mine once again, but this time it was different. I reminisced about our initial kiss as he boldly delved inside me, exploring with a languid touch.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dInitially, it felt like the rough movement of a forceful tongue, but now it resembled a slow caress. He skillfully twisted his tongue, teasing the tender flesh within. The sensation tickled and caused my body to twist, prompting a brief chuckle to escape his lips, as if he found it amusing.After the long, passionate kiss concluded, his hand moved downwards. The hand that had caressed my neck delicately grazed the soft skin beneath my chest. A tantalizing sensation spread from below, encompassing my entire body. As it intensified, my body tensed, expecting him to once again delve into me.However, he didn\u2019t immediately penetrate me.Instead, with closed eyes, he pressed his lips against my neck, trailing them along the nape. His hand slowly descended along the center of my back. Then, with a slight force, he pressed against my pelvis. My limp body, which had been weakly sprawled on the bed, suddenly jolted, emitting a soft thud as it flipped over.The crisp and cool bed sheet brushed against my face. For a brief moment, I regained my senses amidst its chilly touch.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI had to get up. However, my body lacked the strength to do so. In the meantime, his hand gripped my waist, pulling me up. His leg approached from behind and slightly spread apart my legs, which had been supported by weakly bent knees.[Thud!]Then, the sound of water dripping onto the sheets resonated. As my body opened up, everything that had accumulated within me flowed out.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve spilled it all.\u201dRegretfully, he wiped the inner part of my thigh where the liquid had trickled down with his palm. Then, he pressed his body against mine from behind.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I can fill you up again.\u201dJust as his desire was about to surge into me once more\u2026[Dong!]The sound of the bell tower\u2019s chimes resonated from afar. After the twelfth chime ended, I looked at my hands. They remained the same. Nothing had changed. I didn\u2019t lose consciousness or hear Evelina\u2019s voice. Everything remained as it was.\u201cThey didn\u2019t take my body away!\u201dThe thought crossed my mind, and I abruptly rose to my feet. I pushed away his body, which was about to enter me. He hadn\u2019t expected me to move so suddenly, and he stumbled backward.\u201cYour Highness?\u201dIgnoring his bewildered voice calling out to me, I removed my nightgown. Though a few buttons were missing, it thankfully covered enough of my body. With trembling hands, I hastily dressed myself, then gazed at the prince, who still remained on the bed. He looked at me with a perplexed expression, as if unable to comprehend the situation.As I caught a glimpse of his menacing figure standing menacingly beneath dishevelled clothing, I quickly averted my gaze. The vivid crimson hue of his enraged veins made it resemble nothing but a deadly weapon. That had been what pierced me just a while ago. Multiple times, repeatedly.That was what I, no, what Evelina had desired.\u201cThank you.\u201dWithout realizing it, those words slipped out. They were sincere.\u201cPardon?\u201dThe prince wore a face of confusion. Lowering my head again, I spoke once more.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI had used him. I didn\u2019t think he was particularly exceptional, nor did I do it out of genuine affection. It was just that someone I had been interested in had asked me to do it, so I approached it lightly. I was fortunate to have chosen him. Thanks to that, I was able to fulfill Evelina\u2019s condition in due time, and he had slept with the woman he desired, allowing him to return to the empire contentedly.I approached the door, my weary legs moving with effort.\u201cGood Lord, what is this\u2026! Please wait!\u201dI heard him hastily undoing his clothes from behind. Swiftly, I unlocked the door, eager to escape from this place. More precisely, I wanted to distance myself from the evidence that proved my acceptance of Evelina\u2019s terms.With a creak, the door swung open. The cool air from outside revived my senses. Simultaneously, a sharp pang rose from beneath my abdomen, as if reminding me of what I had been doing just moments ago.I welcomed that pain.It confirmed that I still existed. That I could feel pain, within my own body.\u201cEvelina!\u201dWas I dressed? I heard the Crown Prince calling my name, following closely behind. Unintentionally, I paused at the sound of him addressing me as Evelina. Yes, Evelina. That\u2019s my name now.The frigid sensation of the cold, hard pavement touched the soles of my bare feet. I had to leave this place immediately.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dBut the moment I took a step forward, a wave of pain surged through my leg, as if something still lingered inside. Unbeknownst to me, my body swayed involuntarily. I might fall. That thought crossed my mind.[Thunk!]Something grabbed hold of me. Startled, I looked up to see the person who had caught me. At that moment, I had to question my own eyes. Standing before me was Rattva, wearing a terrifying expression I had never witnessed before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He couldn\u2019t fathom what was happening or how things had taken such a turn. The maiden had proposed to him first, of course, and he had eagerly accepted her offer. He had imagined being led to an empty room, unable to contain his anticipation until the moment they reached their destination, and the dawn would break as they tossed and turned.It was a fleeting thought, like a parched wanderer in the desert, barely moistening his lips with water. From now on, he had intended to plunge himself into a deeper well. He believed that by searching and thirsting until morning, this thirst of his would be quenched to some extent.But it was not meant to be. As the distant toll of midnight bells echoed in his ears, the maiden suddenly rose from her place. She made incomprehensible sounds, expressing gratitude and apologies, as she attempted to leave.He had been with countless women before, but this was the first time he had encountered such a situation. If she were simply afraid, he could understand, but the expression on the maiden\u2019s face did not convey such emotions.It almost seemed as though spending the night with him was one of her daily tasks, judging by the relief apparent on her face. And yet, he couldn\u2019t comprehend why she was crying. For now, he needed to calm her down and have a conversation.In a hurry to catch the maiden as she walked out the door, he hastily searched for his discarded pants. He had no time to consider whether they were facing forward or backward, or if his legs would fit properly.\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Leon wanted to grab the maiden immediately and confront her. He felt as though he had been momentarily used for her amusement. Was this what people meant when they said \u201cuse and discard\u201d? Leon followed the maiden, stepping into the corridor.He saw her stumbling, on the verge of collapse. However, there was a hand holding her back. When Leon saw the face of the man gripping her, a sound escaped his lips, akin to a whimper.\u201cSir Latvan\u2026\u201dThe person who caught the falling maiden was Latvan. The moment Leon\u2019s gaze met his, Leon involuntarily wavered. It was a gaze that seemed ready to tear him apart on the spot. Only then did Leon consider how this situation would appear in the eyes of others.The dishevelled maiden, clad in a nightgown, ran away in tears, and behind her, there was me, attempting to restrain her, with my clothes dishevelled and not properly worn.That\u2019s when Latvan opened his mouth, addressing the maiden.\u201cDo you desire the author\u2019s disposal?\u201dUpon hearing those words, Leon hurriedly searched for his sword. However, the sword he had brought as a precautionary measure was most likely rolling beneath the bed in that room, where he had recently intertwined with the maiden.\u201cDamn it.\u201dThe thought crossed his mind, wondering if this had all been planned. Even if Latvan were to draw his sword at this very moment and threaten him, Leon had no words to say. The maiden seduced him so suddenly, and now she was crying and running away? Who would believe such a story?\u201cN-no!\u201dAt that moment, the maiden shook her head hurriedly to Latvan. Then, she pushed away Latvan\u2019s arm that was holding her and attempted to walk down the corridor again. However, she soon sank down, defeated. When Latvan lifted her up once more, a white liquid trickled down the black stone corridor.A brief silence fell among the three individuals.Oddly enough, Leon discovered within himself a renewed desire as he watched the maiden, who was walking with her robe flowing graciously. If only he could hold her body once again, comforting her and filling her with his possession.\u201cWe should go\u2026 We must leave from here, for now\u2026\u201dAs the maiden murmured, bowing her head deeply, Latvan, who had been glaring at her as if to devour her, removed the upper garment of his own attire and placed it over her.\u201cAllow me.\u201dWith those words, the maiden walked with even greater difficulty, bowing her head even more. Was it because she felt stifled? Latvan hesitated briefly, then held the maiden with both arms and swiftly proceeded down the corridor. Just before turning the corner, he spoke to Leon.\u201cWe shall discuss the details in the morning.\u201dIn Latvan\u2019s voice, steeped in unyielding anger, Leon found himself unable to utter a single word. He could only gaze at the maiden, wrapped in Latvan\u2019s garments, her face hidden from view.Soon, Latvan and the maiden disappeared, leaving Leon alone in the corridor.\u201cWhat in the world\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t grasp what had just happened. However, one thing was certain: she had not set any traps. Leon circled the corridor several times, where the bed sheets were in disarray, confirming that the recent events were not a figment of his imagination.Having found his sword, Leon finished dressing and was about to leave the room when something caught his eye on the floor.\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dIt was a button, attached to the maiden\u2019s nightgown. It had likely fallen off when he hastily undressed her. Leon briefly observed it before placing it in his pocket.\u201cI need to find out.\u201dA thought that had occurred to him earlier resurfaced in his mind. Could the maiden have been able to marry?The first woman to have received my seed.Leon wiped his lips with the back of his hand. The thirst within him would not subside completely until he had the maiden completely within his grasp.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I stared blankly at my wet hair, and then turned my head to survey my surroundings. The ceiling and walls were lavish, but the interior felt desolate, like a newly constructed mansion. All that existed was the bathtub I was immersed in and a simple storage cabinet\u2014nothing more. There was not a single decorative item in sight, a space purely focused on practicality.\u201cIt suits me,\u201d I murmured.Just like a house reflects its owner, Latvan\u2019s residence emanated a similar impression.This place was Latvan\u2019s house, or more precisely, the residence of the Commander of the Knights within the Temple. The Grand Temple, with a size equivalent to that of a city, accommodated the personal abodes of most knights belonging to the Temple\u2019s order. While the recently joined knights had to share dormitories within the Temple\u2019s building, those of higher rank were granted private estates.As the Commander of the Knights, Latvan had received one of these residences\u2014a large house situated deeper than any of the others. Its size and opulence were befitting of a man of his stature. He had brought me here.\u201cWell, where else could I go in such a state?\u201dWhen I entered the bathroom, the sight that greeted me was nothing short of a mess. My hair was dishevelled as if I were a lunatic, my eyes swollen from crying, and my nose a fiery shade of red. Moreover, the tattered nightgown failed to serve any purpose beyond concealing certain intimate areas.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAs I immersed my body in the warm water, I could feel the tension gradually leaving my stiff muscles.\u201cI suppose it\u2019s what Latvan normally uses.\u201dUpon seeing the oversized bathtub, large enough for at least one more person, I couldn\u2019t help but think that it must be Latvan\u2019s preference. When I glanced beside me, there was only a rudimentary bar of soap. I recalled how he had apologized for its scarcity and hastily left the bathroom. Compared to the countless luxurious toiletries and perfumes found in the sanctuary of the High Priestess, this bathroom with a mere bar of soap must have seemed lacking to him.As I picked up the soap, a refreshing fragrance wafted through the air.\u201cThat scent from earlier.\u201dWhen I was nestled in Latvan\u2019s embrace as he brought me here, it was the same scent that lingered on his body. Suddenly, my face flushed.Regaining my composure, I thoroughly washed every nook and cranny of my body. However, when my hand grazed over my chest, a sharp pain shot through me. I lowered my head and sighed involuntarily.My breasts, pressed against his chest and fondled with urgency, were now swollen and tender. Especially my nipples, which were so sensitive that even a slight touch caused moans to escape.\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t left there at that time\u2026\u201dThoughts of the Crown Prince, who was eagerly seeking to possess me, came to mind. I had heard that one could grow tired after engaging in sexual intercourse, but there was no trace of exhaustion anywhere. If I had stayed in that room, I was certain we would have continued intertwining our bodies until morning.\u201cMy body wouldn\u2019t have been able to take it.\u201dIt was not only my breasts that tingles with pain but also the innermost part of my tongue, which had brazenly welcomed him. Recalling the sensation of him thrusting into me without hesitation sent a shiver down my spine. It wasn\u2019t horrifying or anything of the sort. It was just that this was the first time I had so deeply embraced someone, and the unfamiliarity and awkwardness made me feel uneasy.As I gazed at the marks left on my chest, I took a deep breath and let my hand fall. Lingering pain still remained between my legs, where the Prince\u2019s member had ventured.\u201cI wonder if it would have been different if it were Evalina\u2019s body.\u201dI remembered his lower body under the moonlight. Embarrassing as it was, I recalled the men with whom Evalina had intertwined her body. After a long while, I let out a sigh.\u201cIt was enormous\u2026.\u201dThus, her weary body, familiar in its own way, seemed to be struggling. I wiped away the dried semen on the inside of my thigh. In truth, I still can\u2019t believe that I have mixed my body with Prince Leon. Deep down, I couldn\u2019t understand why I had been so afraid of this and why I had persisted in refusing it.\u201cI don\u2019t really know, but\u2026\u201dThe vague disgust and discomfort that I had harbored did not seem to exist. Although Prince Leon pushed urgently, he soon, almost as if teaching me, treated me gently. It was as if he noticed it was my first time.\u201cIt\u2019s over. After all, it\u2019s not the first time for this body, either.\u201dMoreover, I didn\u2019t want to attach much significance to such things.\u201cBy the way, what will Prince Leon do now?\u201dWhen I left that place, I kept thinking about his bewildered gaze. He grabbed someone passing by out of necessity, used them, and then ran away recklessly.\u201cHe must have felt uncomfortable.\u201dThat alone was absurd and infuriating. He had grabbed me as if to claim me and then disappeared on his own. I wondered if he might leave the palace before morning. He is a prince. He is not the kind of person who would silently endure such treatment.\u201cBut he wouldn\u2019t declare a duel on behalf of the palace just because of this.\u201dNevertheless, there was no need to confidently speak about it anywhere.\u201cI hope he returns soon.\u201dAs I was thinking that, I heard a knocking sound on the door.\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cI left clothes for you to change outside.\u201dI heard Latvan\u2019s voice, low and sinking. And soon, with the sound of his retreating footsteps, I heard the closing of the door from outside.I quickly washed my body. This is not my room. I can\u2019t keep getting lost in these thoughts forever.\u201cI wonder how I should apologize.\u201dTo make matters worse, I am even borrowing the bathroom in someone else\u2019s house. I discreetly opened the door while covering my body with a towel and saw a neatly folded set of clothes that seemed to belong to the palace. I quickly dried myself and put them on. Thankfully, they were spacious enough to wear comfortably.The tattered nightgown and the underwear stained with me and Prince Leon\u2019s fluids inside the bathroom, I hesitated for a moment before tucking them into the towel. It was embarrassing, but I had no choice.\u201cI can\u2019t leave them here.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I left them here, it would be a grave offense to Latvan. I worried that if the Saint saw evidence of a tryst with a man and then left, she might burn everything after I left.I wore the clothes and carried the towel as I walked out. He was sitting on the rough sofa in the living room, frozen in posture. I bowed my head towards him.\u201cThank you, Lord Latvan. To use someone else\u2019s bathroom so late at night\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it.\u201dHe looked at me and asked.\u201cYou don\u2019t have suitable clothes?\u201d\u201cNo. Just the fact that you brought me clothes at this late hour is more than enough. Who is the noble who lent me these clothes? I must express my gratitude to them later.\u201dThen, his face suddenly turned red. Latvan\u2019s eyes trembled.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cLord Latvan?\u201dAs I examined the garments, I surmised that they belonged to someone slightly larger in stature than myself. In that case, he couldn\u2019t be a knight. Could it be that he asked about a personal acquaintance of mine, a female attendant? Otherwise, there would be no reason for his clothes to be here in his house.\u201cWho is it?\u201d I inquired.Though I was well aware that it couldn\u2019t be possible, a thought crossed my mind\u2014perhaps he had a personal friendship with a lady attendant. Otherwise, there would be no way his clothes could have remained in his house.In the midst of these thoughts, his face grew even redder. Simultaneously, he appeared unsure of what to do. Observing him in that state, I couldn\u2019t help but feel as if I had done something terribly wrong.\u201cSir Latvan? If it\u2019s uncomfortable for you to speak\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mine. Therefore, there\u2019s no need for you to worry about any formalities.\u201dUpon hearing those words, I glanced once more at the clothing. Could this truly be Latvan\u2019s attire?\u201cBut it\u2019s so small\u2026\u201d\u201cI received it during my early training days when I first entered the Holy Knights\u2019 Order.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dSilence once again enveloped the space between us. I glanced discreetly at the inside of the collar. Indeed, the name \u2018Latvan\u2019 was sloppily embroidered there.When knights enter the Holy Knights\u2019 Order, they spend several months studying the scriptures and familiarizing themselves with the teachings of the Great Temple alongside the secular priests. Perhaps this was the clothing he wore during that time. With that thought in mind, my face seemed to flush as well.\u201cThis is Latvan\u2019s attire, indeed\u2026\u201dIt was hard to believe that a man with such a towering figure had once been so diminutive as to wear clothing that closely resembled mine. Intrigued, I continued examining the garments, and as I turned my head, our gazes met. At that moment, Latvan spoke.\u201cWell, shall I escort you to the room\u2026\u201d\u201cLatvan.\u201dI promptly interrupted his words.\u201cIf it\u2019s not too much trouble, may I have a cup of tea?\u201dMy sudden request caused him to freeze for a moment before bowing his head.\u201cI apologize. I will prepare for it shortly.\u201dIt seemed he interpreted my words as a rebuke for the lack of hospitality, as if saying, \u201cA guest has arrived, yet there isn\u2019t even a cup of tea.\u201d He promptly stood up and disappeared into the hallway leading from the living room.A sigh escaped me as his figure vanished. I felt somewhat relieved.\u201cI don\u2019t feel like leaving just yet.\u201dThe thought of the attendants who would have followed me had I fled on my own came to mind. If I were to return to the Great Temple now, they would undoubtedly pester me, asking what had happened and if I was alright. Regardless of when I returned, they would inquire about my well-being, but I didn\u2019t want to be bothered with such matters at the moment.\u201cIt\u2019s more comfortable here.\u201dThere was an inexplicable sense of ease within Latvan\u2019s abode. With no one else present and him not inquiring about my involvement with the crown prince, it put my mind at ease. Given his disposition, he would likely never ask. No, he wouldn\u2019t want to ask.I placed the towel I had brought from the bathroom next to the sofa and lay down, burying my head. It was still the late hours of the night outside. Under normal circumstances, I would have already been in bed. On top of that, the emotional and physical exhaustion from my encounter with Prince Leon had taken a toll on me. After soaking my weary body in warm water and changing into fresh clothes, my eyelids grew heavy of their own accord.\u201cWhen Latvan returns, I\u2019ll wake up.\u201dBrewing tea shouldn\u2019t take too long, and perhaps I could steal a brief moment to rest my eyes. With that thought in mind, I succumbed to sleep, if only for a fleeting moment, momentarily forgetting about Iberina.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was not one to eat anything beyond the prescribed amount at the designated time. Therefore, even though it was called a kitchen, there was hardly anything laid out in it. Since he spent most of his days in the Knights\u2019 building, it was more likely that the Tangbi Hall there had more things placed within it than this place.\u201cWhere did I put it?\u201dHe filled the water quickly and searched around. In doing so, he found an envelope containing tea leaves tucked away in a corner. It was something a fellow knight had sent from his hometown and, unable to refuse his kind gesture, Latvan reluctantly accepted it. He had put it away in a suitable place and forgotten about it, never imagining that he would need it like this.This house was one where no one would venture except for the internal caretaker who came once a week for maintenance. Most guests were received at the Knights\u2019 building.While he had a sensitive disposition, Latvan was not particularly fond of anyone entering his domain. But now\u2026As he watched the water slowly come to a boil, he let out a sigh.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHe couldn\u2019t understand why he had brought the maiden here so impulsively.\u201cHow did it come to this?\u201dHe recollected the events before he brought the maiden along.***Due to the recent issues concerning the Crown Prince\u2019s whereabouts, security had been significantly reinforced in the vicinity today. Although it would have been sufficient to entrust the task to the knights, he personally took charge of the security today.\u201cIt\u2019s bothersome.\u201dSince their encounter, Latvan had been continuously monitoring the Crown Prince. He had a bad feeling about it. He had a distinct sense that something untoward was going to happen. The Empire, with its cunning machinations, had its sights set on the Grand Temple. It would be more suspicious if nothing happened here.He should have checked the Crown Prince\u2019s security status and returned to the knights. That\u2019s what he should have done.\u201cI heard that all the afternoon appointments were cancelled, and he is currently resting in his chamber.\u201dHe recalled the words that one of the officials had relayed to him. Shortly after, Latvan noticed that he was heading towards the Saint\u2019s chamber.\u201cWhy?\u201dLatvan was surprised at himself. Why on earth was he heading towards the Saint\u2019s chamber as if it were a matter of course? Why was he going there? He pondered the reasons for quite some time.\u201cTo carry out a task.\u201dHe hadn\u2019t received any orders regarding the consequences of the incident that had occurred during the prayer meeting. Therefore, he had to inquire about the consequences of that incident. Finally, he let out a bitter laugh.\u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse.\u201dHe knew it best. Inquiring about the consequences was merely an excuse for his journey to the Saint\u2019s chamber. He halted his steps. No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn\u2019t find a reason why he should go there right now.\u201cShould I turn back?\u201dAs he stood there for a while, he slowly turned his body. There was no particular reason to go. Therefore, it was right not to go. If he returned to the knights now, important matters would be awaiting him. It was clear that it was right to attend to those matters.Unlike when he was heading towards the Saint\u2019s chamber, his steps were slower as he turned back. That\u2019s when it happened.[Thunk!]He heard the sound of hurried footsteps from across the hallway. Someone was running towards him urgently. Why would there be a reason for officials to rush here? When Latvan turned towards the source of the sound, he saw an official running towards him. It was a familiar official. One of the officials who guarded the entrance to the Saint\u2019s chamber.Her face had turned pale. Then, she saw Latvan and immediately rushed towards him.\u201cCommander Latvan! The Saint!\u201d\u201cWhat happened to the Saint!\u201dUnconsciously, my voice grew louder.\u201cShe suddenly came out and told us not to follow her\u2026 and she went somewhere! She left while still wearing her nightgown!\u201dAs the official spoke, a surge of anger welled up inside Latvan. No matter how much he told her not to follow, she did. The duty of the officials was to protect the Saint. Despite his desperate efforts to control his rising voice, he asked.\u201cWhere did she go?\u201dIn response to his question, the official quickly guided him. While on the way, the official\u2019s expression, which seemed ominous, made him fearful, and she continued speaking.\u201cAh, you know. When the Saint speaks fiercely like in the past, if anyone disobeys her\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t find her state of mind incomprehensible. In the past, the Saint had mercilessly punished officials who disobeyed her words. The punishment was even more severe for low-ranking officials with little power. There were even instances where someone knocked on her door in the morning and ended up in prison. So, it wasn\u2019t unreasonable for the officials to fear the Saint\u2019s words.After a while of the official explaining the Saint\u2019s condition and making excuses for himself, she spoke to him in the corridor near the Saint\u2019s chamber.\u201cShe went that way! And by the time she turned the corner, she had already vanished\u2026\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dHe ran towards the place the official indicated. He was so familiar with the layout of the Grand Temple that he could find his way even with his eyes closed. He followed the faint traces left on the carpet.\u201cShe didn\u2019t even put on shoes.\u201dWhy would the Saint suddenly rush out, wearing only her nightgown and even barefoot? Soon, the carpet-lined corridor came to an end. From here on, he could no longer trace the Saint\u2019s footsteps. At the end of the carpet, there was a staircase. Latvan leaned forward and looked beneath the staircase.It was no different from the main building of the Grand Temple. The door was open all day long, and many officials frequented the area. Even if there weren\u2019t many people passing by at this late hour, he could sense someone moving around.\u201cShe wouldn\u2019t have gone downstairs.\u201dIf the saint appeared in such a state, someone from below would have already come and informed me. Moreover, according to the words of the attendants, the saint had told everyone not to follow her. Thus, it was unlikely that she had slipped in among the people.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A quiet darkness met his eyes.\u201cAbove this\u2026,\u201d he muttered.In fact, it was a different building from the saint\u2019s abode. It was a space designated for visitors to the temple. Now, after the prayer gathering had concluded, many had left, leaving the place momentarily empty. Latvan closed his eyes for a moment. The image of the saint leaping up these stairs formed in his mind. Opening his eyes, he ascended the stairs without hesitation.The vacant building, devoid of the envoy group, was filled only with silence. If the saint was hiding somewhere within, it would take quite some time to find her. However, that wasn\u2019t his immediate concern.\u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201dThe saint had been preoccupied with work to an unusual degree in the past few days. Initially, the attendants who had questioned how long this would go on or what mischief she was up to had fallen silent after a few days. The saint meticulously and efficiently handled the tasks they brought to her. Thanks to her, long-ignored matters were swiftly resolved.Of course, the reason those matters had been postponed was due to the saint, who had kept herself secluded in her chambers with men for a while. But the attendants did not bring up that fact unnecessarily.In the saint\u2019s study, which had been accumulating dust, attendants once again gathered and buzzed around. As Latvan passed by, he overheard one attendant whispering.\u201cDon\u2019t they say when a person suddenly changes, it\u2019s a sign of their impending death?\u201dIt was said as a joke, but Latvan\u2019s face hardened and froze. Strangely, those words kept bothering him. He recalled the image of the saint that she had shown in the past few days. More precisely, her attitude.She claimed to have filled even her free time with appointments. Such behavior appeared urgent and restless, as if being chased by something.Of course, he did not think that the saint would die soon. The saint was the person closest to God. Until now, every saint had passed away in the temple as they reached old age. It was one of the privileges that saints possessed to be able to live out their designated lifespan and return to the side of God. Surely, Evelina would also follow that path. But\u2026\u201cIf she were to return to her previous self\u2026\u201dA suffocating sensation suddenly gripped him. The image of her ordering him to crawl under her feet with disdain-filled eyes came to mind. He also felt disgust towards that image. But how about now? Latvan saw an empty corridor before him. He was bewildered by the fact that he had ascended here in a matter of seconds upon hearing the attendant\u2019s words. He had come because he genuinely worried about the saint\u2019s well-being.\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that it never happened.\u201dHe had crawled like a dog before her in front of everyone. And he had begged for her favor. Evelina had laughed and sneered at him. After that, all that filled his mind was the thought of leaving the Order of the Temple Knights.Latvan couldn\u2019t understand his own transformation. Despite receiving such treatment, he found himself harboring affection for the saint.Latvan lowered his head. Now was not the time to be lost in such thoughts. He had to find the saint quickly and bring her back to her abode. With that in mind, as he took a step forward\u2026\u201cUgh!\u201dA faint sound came from the end of the corridor. He held his breath. What is this sound? As he strained his ears, the sound came again.\u201cAh! Ugh! Ugh!\u201dThe sound was a cry for help. And it was the saint\u2019s voice.In an instant, Latvan\u2019s mind turned blank. He immediately headed toward the source of the sound. Perhaps he misheard it. However, as he approached the origin of the sound, he heard louder cries mixing with the squeaking of a bed. And there was a man\u2019s rough voice.The cries of the saint mingled with those of the prince, Leon.As soon as he confirmed it, Latvan\u2019s hand instinctively reached for the hilt of his sword at his waist.Son of a b*tch. Unspoken profanity turned into fire in his mouth. Swallowing it with a dry mouth, that fire engulfed his insides in an instant. Flames surged from his throat to his chest. Experiencing such a sensation for the first time, Latvan couldn\u2019t even feel his trembling hand.\u201cAh! Ugh! Stop, please!\u201dAmidst the murmurs and voices that filled the air, it was all too easy to imagine what was unfolding within those walls. In this very chamber, the princess and Prince Leon were engaging in an illicit liaison. The mere thought of it set Latvan\u2019s foot in motion. He felt the urge to kick down the door and expose that scoundrel.Yet, just before his foot made contact with the door, he regained his senses.\u201cBy what right?\u201d he pondered.What right did he have to intervene in the affair between the saint and Prince Leon? There was only one possible justification. If the princess did not desire this encounter and the prince was forcing himself upon her. Just then, a voice emerged from within.\u201cIt seems you\u2019ve spilled it all.\u201d the voice spoke tenderly. And in response, there came a soft moan of acquiescence from the saint.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I shall fill you up again,\u201d the voice reassured.A harsh sound escaped Latvan\u2019s lips in retort.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he reached for the kettle, he glanced at his own hand. How tightly had he clenched it? Deep imprints of the sharpened nails were visible on the palm of his hand. The stinging sensation suggested that it was not just a mere scratch but rather an injury.[Sigh]Prince Leon\u2019s voice, full of determination, echoed in his ears.\u201cYou bastard. Not content with mocking that promiscuous lower body of yours in the palace, now you dare to mock it even in the temple.\u201dIntense anger surged towards the prince. His emotions were now directed at someone else.\u201cWhy on earth?\u201dHe knew that he no longer entertained men after his collapse and recovery. That was why he thought the saint would refrain from meeting men for a while.At that moment, Latvan wiped his face with his hand. He realized that the feeling he had towards the saint was one of betrayal. However, he couldn\u2019t pinpoint what exactly it was a betrayal of. Was it a betrayal of his belief that she would regain her composure and live her life properly? Was it really because of that?Once again, Latvan wiped his face. Lately, he kept having strange thoughts.\u201cI wish some calamity would befall me.\u201dIf that were to happen, perhaps he could rid himself of such complicated thoughts.***The tea cup placed on the saucer emitted a delicate clinking sound. It was the same tea cup that had been there since he first received this mansion. Usually, there would be two cups, one for himself and one for the host. However, he held only one cup in his hand.Since no one else had ever come here before, there was never any inconvenience.\u201cShould I set out another cup?\u201dAs he pondered, he lowered his head. There was no need. The saint would never come to this house again. He walked into the living room and realized that the saint was nowhere to be seen.Where could she have gone?\u201cSurely not.\u201dHad she returned to her dwelling alone while he was in the kitchen? But soon, he heard a sound of breathing from beneath the sofa. Peering over the backrest, he saw the saint lying asleep on the sofa. He quietly observed her.\u201cIt was the first suit I received and kept.\u201dIt was the outfit he had received as a child when he entered the temple. Now it has become too small to wear. He couldn\u2019t simply discard it, and he felt hesitant to give it to a newcomer who was about to join the temple. He wasn\u2019t particularly attached to objects, but it was one of the few possessions he owned personally.\u201cI never imagined I would end up using it like this.\u201dTo think he would be using it like this to find suitable clothing for the saint at this hour. Even the smallest knight\u2019s attire would be like a blanket to the saint. Moreover, if he went to find such a thing, the other knights would undoubtedly be curious about what was going on. That\u2019s why he ultimately brought out that outfit.Fortunately, his childhood clothes were a suitable size for the saint. He had taken good care of them, so there was no musty smell. Latvan gazed at the saint, who was wearing his clothes in her own home.The moment he realized it, a burning sensation surged beneath his throat. Latvan opened his mouth as if trying to expel that energy.\u201cLady Saint.\u201dHis words, filled with the heat within him, burst out.He called out with his voice, but the saint didn\u2019t respond.\u201cI felt this before.\u201dHe recalled the saint, who had fallen asleep on the donation bench. Back then, he called her multiple times and even lifted her up, but she didn\u2019t wake up. It must be the same now.[Clink]Latvan gently placed the tea cup on the table. Then, he approached the front of the sofa.Should he take her back to her dwelling?He cradled the saint in his arms, still she did not stir. He felt a sense of unease at the sight of her limp arms. She looked truly dead at times like this. Latvan gazed at the saint within his possession. He heard a faint breath. Slowly, he saw the gentle rise and fall of her chest. And he felt warmth.Latvan\u2019s footsteps approached his room. He thought to himself how fortunate it was that he had tidied the bed this morning.***I opened my eyes.Perhaps because I had seen it before, the darkness that now appeared felt familiar. Slowly, I turned my head.\u201cEvelina\u2026\u201dThe person I expected was standing there, looking at me. Unlike the last voice I had heard, she was smiling brightly. It was a beautiful but twisted smile.It was not difficult to guess why she was waiting for me with that smile.\u201cI didn\u2019t think you would go all the way.\u201dOf course. Her voice, filled with contempt, reached my ears. Now her voice felt awkward. Until just a while ago, it was my voice. The voice of the Evelina who had taken over me. Even though she was the original owner, it felt as if she had stolen my voice.\u201cSeems like it was worth doing after all. You don\u2019t seem as miserable as I thought.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it wasn\u2019t as terrible as I had anticipated.\u201d\u201c\u2026.!\u201dAt my response, Evelina\u2019s body twitched for a moment. At the same time, her laughter quickly faded away. It was only natural. Unlike before, I no longer referred to her with reverence.\u201cOh, you\u2019re quite angry. Still, it\u2019s not that bad. You should be grateful for the experience I\u2019ve given you, shouldn\u2019t you?\u201dSuch audacity doesn\u2019t make me angry anymore. I stared at her for a long time and then asked.\u201cWhy did you appear? You said you would uphold your end of the bargain.\u201d\u201cYeah, I thought you wouldn\u2019t be able to do it, but you did.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to say? Get to the point.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The uneasiness I felt in her voice intensified when I saw her face. Now it was not just uneasiness, but also a sense of discomfort. I remembered the actions I took to lure the prince into the room. I followed Evelina\u2019s conditions and succeeded. Therefore, that body should be mine now.\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing. I expected you to go crazy and cause a scene.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s all you have to say, then send me back already.\u201dEvelina approached me with those words.\u201cWas the Saint\u2019s play really that enjoyable? Spreading your legs for a man you\u2019ve never even seen, moaning and writhing beneath him?\u201dIn an instant, I felt something strange about Evelina\u2019s words. The person I slept with was Prince Leon. But now she said I was a man she had never seen before. That couldn\u2019t be true.\u201cEvelina can see everything inside of me,\u201d she had said.If that were true, she wouldn\u2019t use such an expression. I became doubtful for a moment. Could Evelina really see everything? I swallowed my saliva. Another thought crossed my mind.\u201cYeah, it was enjoyable. Unlike you, who can\u2019t do the role of a proper saint, people treated me well when I did.\u201d\u201cSo, by the way, there\u2019s someone I want to ask about while I\u2019m doing it properly. He doesn\u2019t appear in your memories. It\u2019s as if you\u2019re deliberately hiding him.\u201dEvelina\u2019s face contorted at my words. In an instant, my heart began to pound. If she took this as a betrayal and took my body away, what would I do? But I wanted to make sure. Until now, I had thought that Evelina saw everything I did. But if that wasn\u2019t the case\u2026 Could it be that Evelina couldn\u2019t control this body completely?\u201cI won\u2019t let myself be manipulated by Evelina any longer.\u201dWhen I thought about it, there were many strange things. I recalled Evelina\u2019s voice that kindly informed me of the remaining days every morning. With her personality, it wouldn\u2019t have ended with just that. She would have continued to talk and mock me about every little thing. Especially when I grabbed the prince\u2019s arm, she would have done it even more.The name that had caused her body to react roughly not too long ago came to mind. Somehow, I felt that it could be a weapon against her. I looked at Evelina and spoke.\u201cCarl.\u201dAs expected. Evelina froze as if my uttered name had turned her to ice. I spoke again.\u201cCarl, who is that person? Why does he remain invisible, no matter how hard I try to recall? You said he was someone you had adored since childhood?\u201d\u201cWhy do you know that name!\u201dIn an instant, her face contorted in such a terrifying manner. It was a facial expression I had never witnessed before. It resembled the countenance of someone confronting the most dreadful thing in the world. Loathing, contempt, and fear. All the negative emotions that exist were swirling on Evelina\u2019s face.In the midst of her expression, my suspicion turned into certainty. The person named Carl was undoubtedly a threat to Evelina. And I confirmed that Evelina wasn\u2019t oblivious to everything.If it were just a slip of the tongue concerning the prince, one could have dismissed it as a mistake. But not with Carl. I had received a list with his name on it and even discussed him with the officials. I couldn\u2019t ask how she knew about such a person.\u201cWhy? Who on earth is that person?\u201dWas it the pleasure of seeing Evelina\u2019s face contorted for the first time that caused my laughter to escape before I could conceal it? That was when Evelina reached out and grabbed my throat.[Gasp!]Evelina began choking my neck with both hands. I didn\u2019t even consider resisting. With this body of mine, it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway.At that moment, a thought occurred to me. Since entering this space, have I ever seen my own hands? Then Evelina shook me and shouted harshly.\u201cShut up. Do you think I won\u2019t be able to take possession of your body right away?\u201d\u201cIf you can, go ahead! Why? Are you planning to impose yet another condition?\u201dAn unknown courage arose within me. If I were to prostrate myself before Evelina again here and now, I knew she would torment me with more absurd conditions. I couldn\u2019t retreat any further.Evelina lowered her head at my words.\u201cThere\u2019s no need for conditions. You received a letter, didn\u2019t you?\u201dIt was a sudden question, but I could discern what she meant by the letter. The letter that employed magic and vanished into ashes upon reading, leaving no trace behind.Judging by Evelina\u2019s reaction to my expression, she knew that I had received it. Without further inquiry, she released her grip on my throat and, as if imparting a great secret in a tender manner, she gently whispered.\u201cNow, you must birth the offspring of a beast. With that body of yours.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is this sudden utterance? Moreover, how does it relate to Evelina\u2019s earlier remarks and the letter?\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cGet out.\u201dEvelina coldly pushed me away and stared at me menacingly.\u201cI look forward to seeing if you\u2019ll be able to smile next time.\u201dWith those words, Evelina turned around. In that instant, as if the ground had vanished beneath me, my body swiftly plummeted downward. I closed my eyes, feeling the unsettling sensation of freefall. The mention of \u201cnext time\u201d made it clear that Evelina would summon me again from this darkness someday.How far will I fall? Pondering this, I cautiously opened my eyes and caught sight of my trembling hand, struggling towards Evelina.At that moment, I opened my eyes once more.Where am I? It\u2019s not the familiar ceiling. The air feels unfamiliar too. This is not the room of the saint, always filled with the fragrance of flowers. Instead, a faint scent of soap mixes with the low, lingering smell of aged wood. Slowly, I moved my hand and felt my surroundings. Indeed, this is not the bed where I usually fall asleep.Instead of soft sheets, my hand touched rough and rigid fabric. The chilly sensation told me that I was in an unfamiliar space that reminded me of someone.\u201cLatvan?\u201dAs I mumbled those words, the memories from right before I fell asleep quickly flooded back. Yes, I slept with Prince Leon, met Latvan, and came to his mansion to bathe\u2026\u201cI fell asleep just like that.\u201dGoodness gracious. It seems I fell into a deep sleep while momentarily closing my eyes while he went to fetch the carriage. Remembering this, I hastily sat up.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dA dull pain surged between my legs, along with the soreness in my chest that I had forgotten about. I glanced at my clothes, lifting them slightly. There were more pronounced traces of redness than when I washed myself.Perhaps I cried. Blinking with swollen eyes, I looked around. The place where I lay was a large, spacious bed. Observing the headboard, I could tell it had been made a long time ago. Scratches and peeled-off paint here and there revealed the typical aging of furniture that had been used for many years.\u201cThis is definitely\u2026\u201dUnintentionally, I pulled the thin blanket over my face. Then I gently sniffed. As expected. I could detect the well-washed fabric\u2019s scent mixed with the fragrance of soap from the bathroom and a slightly heavier scent of cologne.[Sigh]A sigh escaped my lips. Though no one had told me, I somehow knew. This is Latvan\u2019s bed.\u201cI\u2019ve gone mad.\u201dI truly crossed the line. Crying, clinging, and barging into his home wasn\u2019t enough; now I\u2019ve unabashedly used someone else\u2019s bed. Embarrassment flushed my face. I approached the window, dampening the curtains. The sky still held the dawn\u2019s pale blue hue.\u201cI should go back.\u201dI can\u2019t stay here any longer.Carefully, I opened the door and stepped out, making sure to avoid making any noise in the living room.\u201cAre you awake?\u201dLatvan\u2019s voice resonated as if he had been waiting.\u201cIt seems sneaking out was a mistake.\u201dFeeling embarrassed and apologetic, I tried to leave this house without him noticing, but upon reflection, the mere act of sneaking out from the commander\u2019s house itself was utterly absurd.After uttering those words, Latvan rose from his seat. Although he had taken off his outer garments, he remained dressed exactly as he had been the previous night. Could it be that he had stayed awake all night?\u201cSurely, Latvan, it\u2019s not because of me.\u201dLooking at the items inside this house gave me a clue. It was a sparsely furnished dwelling, containing only the bare essentials. There would likely be no other bedroom in this mansion apart from the one where I had fallen asleep. Then, where could he have been?As I observed him standing up, I couldn\u2019t help but notice that his face appeared slightly gaunter than a few hours ago.\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. Rather\u2026\u201dHe glanced at me momentarily, then wiped his face with his palm before speaking.\u201cIt would be best for you to leave as quickly as possible if you wish to return.\u201dHis voice, now lowered, was becoming strained.Fortunately, before the day fully dawned, I was able to return unharmed to the Saint\u2019s chamber. Only the guards who had been guarding the door knew that I had ventured out at night. Latvan had assured me that he would take care of their surveillance and then urged me to rest inside the room.Thanks to that, I managed to get a little more sleep before the scheduled events began.\u201cWhat should I do with this\u2026\u201dBefore the officials entered, I changed my clothes and neatly folded the plain court dress I had received from him, placing it inside a drawer.\u201cI should have it cleaned and returned.\u201dIt was the ceremonial attire he had received when he was very young. The fact that he had kept it so carefully preserved, to the point where someone could still wear it, undoubtedly meant it held great value to him.\u201cBut I can\u2019t entrust it to the officials.\u201dAs I looked inside the garment, Latvan\u2019s name was prominently embroidered. If his clothes were to be seen coming out of my room, it was obvious what kind of rumors would spread.\u201cAt this point, my reputation can\u2019t possibly decline any further\u2026.\u201dBut Latvan\u2019s could. I remembered the image of the officials who, not long after I arrived, had suggested they would appoint a new commander and urged me to consider a name they were familiar with. If any rumors associated with me were to surface, they would undoubtedly be the most embarrassing kind for him.[Sigh]Sometime in the future, I would have to find a way to launder it myself, even if I had to do it alone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
