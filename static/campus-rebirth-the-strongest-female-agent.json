The victims killed under her name could line up an entire street.The girls in front looked about the same age as her but one glance at them and she could tell that they were most probably spoiled brats who would be terrified if they just saw a corpse.A smile suddenly tugged at Yun Jian\u2019s lips; it was faint yet eerie.The two girls who were closing in on her were stunned, halting their steps as a result.\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Go! Stop dilly-dallying! Are you waiting for dishes to be served?\u201d Lin Mengyu shouted at the girls upon seeing them pause.\u201cDo you know\u2026\u201d Yun Jian spoke suddenly, replying to Lin Mengyu.Lin Mengyu was taken aback. \u201cWhat? What do I know?\u201d \u2018Has this bitch turned stupid? Acting like she just lost her memory and here she is now leaving people hanging.\u2019Even if that was the case, Lin Mengyu would never let such a wretch off easy. There was no doubt about it!\u201cTo those who wish to harm me, I\u2019ll usually\u2026\u201d Yun Jian moved abruptly as she spoke.In the blink of an eye, she was already behind Lin Mengyu. Yun Jian stretched her hand, fingers arched like an eagle\u2019s claws, and clenched it on Lin Mengyu\u2019s neck the next second.She heaved a breath of air onto Lin Mengyu\u2019s back and continued what she was saying. \u201cTwist their neck off, like this!\u201dHer hand tightened simultaneously.It was only then that Lin Mengyu and her two minions managed to react. Truthfully, it had only been a blink of an eye when Yun Jian who was still one to two meters away just now flashed behind to Lin Mengyu\u2019s back.Lin Mengyu shuddered involuntarily.Had Yun Jian gone insane?How could someone as weak and cowardly as a wimp seem to have transformed into another person just a short moment after being beaten and knocked unconscious?\u201cAh\u2026 ah\u2026\u201dInevitably Lin Mengyu was infuriated by Yun Jian\u2019s threat. She was an ill-tempered girl after all, but would soon realize that she could not speak just at the moment she wanted to snap back. Her neck, gripped by Yun Jian, felt like it was blocked. She could not utter even a word.A hint of panic finally slipped into Lin Mengyu.In spite of it, she did not know that her neck would actually break had Yun Jian added more force to her grasp.Killing someone was as simple as eating or sleeping in Yun Jian\u2019s previous world. It was only because she had no idea where she was now that she hesitated to act brutally. She did not know if this was a siege.Otherwise, Lin Mengyu would have long been a cold corpse.Just as Lin Mengyu\u2019s breathing quickened and was near the brink of suffocation, Yun Jian suddenly loosened her choke and savagely kicked her down to the floor. The former took a breath of relief.Lin Mengyu shrieked, causing her two minions to scramble and help her up.Looking at the pathetic trio, Yun Jian spoke softly, \u201cI\u2019ve never been a mild-tempered person. You girls wanted to shove my head into that sh*t-filled toilet bowl just now, so I\u2019m giving you two choices. One, you jump into the cesspit, or I will kill all of you right now.\u201d\u2018Kill all of you\u2019 sounded as casual as \u2018Have you eaten today\u2019 leaving Yun Jian\u2019s lips. However, her words made the hearts of Lin Mengyu\u2019s trio leap to their throat.You can also listen onLiked it?

Her RevivalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy Translation\u201cCough - cough, cough!\u201d Lin Mengyu who was freed heaved before coughing.Then, she stared at Yun Jian, conveniently ignoring her threat, and feigned a brave front despite her fear.\u201cYun Jian, how dare you threaten me! How dare you hit me! Do you know who my father is? My father is our school\u2019s principal! I want you to apologize right this instant! Or else you can forget about coming back to this school. I\u2019ll have my father to expel you immediately!\u201dThe reason Lin Mengyu dared to assault Yun Jian in school because her father was the principal of Xinjiang Town Junior High School.In fact, Lin Mengyu would not let Yun Jian go easily even if the latter submissively apologized to her.The current Yun Jian, however, was no longer a cowardly wimp.Apologizing for nothing was never a chapter in Yun Jian\u2019s book of morals.She wore an odd smile as she went closer to the trio.\u201cWhat - what do you want?\u201d The girls asked trembling as they stepped back in unison, frightened when they recalled Yun Jian\u2019s swift movement earlier.Yun Jian standing before three of them kept a hinted smile before spitting three words that baffled the girls. -\u201dTo kill you.\u201dSince these three girls were so stubborn, there was no need for them to keep living in this world!Moreover, Lin Mengyu had just ordered the two other girls to harm her. Yun Jian had given them a chance earlier yet they were the ones who did not take it.A murderous intent promptly exuded from Yun Jian.Forced into a corner by Yun Jian\u2019s murderous aura, Lin Mengyu and girls could only shake uncontrollably without daring to say a word.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s here! They\u2019ve pulled my friend, Yun Jian, into the washroom!\u201d An anxious yet firm voice of a girl came from the outside just as Yun Jian was about to kill the trio.Frowning, Yun Jian turned around to have a look.A young girl around fifteen to sixteen years old came into the washroom followed by two female teachers. The teenage girl was petite and adorable but worry flooded over her delicate features.Out of the blue, Yun Jian\u2019s mind went blank when she saw her face, regaining her composure after she staggered two steps back.A fragment of memory that distinctly did not belong to her thrust into her brain.What was going on?\u201cXiao Jian! Are you okay!\u201d The adorable girl with a petite frame ran over to help when she saw her stumble back as if she was going to fall.Yun Jian closed her eyes, opening them three seconds later; countless scenes flashing across her mind.She was revived. It seemed that her hypothesis was correct. She had indeed entered another girl\u2019s body.For some reason, a chunk of memory had suddenly appeared in her head; all the memory of this original girl had been recovered. The original owner of the body she has transferred to was also named Yun Jian.The original owner, Yun Jian, was an average ninth grade schoolgirl in Xinjiang Town Junior High School.She came from an average background. Everything about her was ordinary but she had a delicate and pretty face; it was not alluring, her features were clean and pleasant, giving off an exquisite tinge to her beauty.Everything that was a plight stemmed from her beautiful face.Xinjiang Town Junior High\u2019s popular guy, Yuan Yingjun, was a couple with Lin Mengyu. Their relationship was known throughout the school and was even showered with praises, thought to be a match made in heaven.Who would have known that Yuan Yingjun was a playboy, flinging his love and flirting with the original owner also named Yun Jian; he had even begun to cling onto and pester her.In spite of it, the girl had always avoided him.Lin Mengyu, Yuan Yingjun\u2019s official girlfriend, was of course indignant. She was dead set on assuming that it was Yun Jian who had seduced Yuan Yingjun in the first place.Thus, explains why Yun Jian was dragged to the washroom in between a lesson today and Lin Mengyu had summoned her minions to teach the girl a lesson.Having had enough humiliation and what life had thrown at her after the round of violence, the original owner of Yun Jian\u2019s body actually relinquished her will to live, taking her last breath, and passed on.Nobody knew how, but she the Slaying God, the ace of secret agents, the legend of mercenaries, had revived as the ninth grader Yun Jian, taking her body.This was how the previous episode had happened.You can also listen onLiked it?

Yun Jian was the one who replaced her now.As a secret agent in her previous life, Yun Jian had long become tired of her job. She had wished to leave the organization and retire the world of assassins and secret agents to live normally with her younger brother.She did not expect that her young brother would be murdered and she would encounter a rebirth that was so bizarre.Nonetheless, arriving at this body meant that she was finally free from that organization.Yun Jian accepted the outcome easily but the death of her younger brother remained unresolved!She had planned for early retirement but those people in her previous life were crazed, holding her younger brother hostage and killing him.Although she had executed Wolf.Kill, Yun Jian knew there must be someone else in the shadows who was manipulating Wolf.Kill.There was no way Yun Jian would give up her revenge!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!\u201d shouted the younger of the two teachers whom Lu Feiyan had called to rescue Yun Jian.This was Miss Wang, a new teacher who had just graduated from university and was assigned to Xinjiang Town Junior High School.She, too, knew that Lin Mengyu was the daughter of the school principal, someone she could not afford to offend.Usually, these teachers turned a blind eye whenever Lin Mengyu caused trouble in school.Miss Wang was young but she was perceptive. She did not shout at Lin Mengyu for fear of offending her and indirectly offending the school principal.As a teacher who was just newly assigned, Miss Wang dared not upset the principal!On the other hand, Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan were ordinary villagers in her eyes. They had no powerful family nor authority, their parents were either workers or farmers.The comparison instantly showed stark favoritism.\u201cMiss, it\u2019s Lin Mengyu and the rest who pulled my friend into the washroom. And they said that they\u2019ll teach her a lesson!\u201d Lu Feiyan explained to Miss Wang before Yun Jian said anything.Miss Wang was not a teacher Lu Feiyan or Yun Jian. It was because Lu Feiyan was afraid that Yun Jian would be bullied if she came too late, so she called the teacher for help without explaining anything in time.Lu Feiyan\u2019s request was for Miss Wang to help Yun Jian. Yet the teacher had only scanned Yun Jian, knowing that she was only a poor girl from the village upon analyzing her frayed clothes. Looking at her haughtily, and replied to Lu Feiyan, \u201cA junior high school student should look like one! If your friend didn\u2019t cause trouble first, would Lin Mengyu bully her for nothing?\u201dIt was obvious that Miss Wang was on Lin Mengyu\u2019s side. - It was blatant bias.Lu Feiyan was stunned before her heart dropped.\u201cBut Miss, it was Lin Mengyu who bullied my friend first! Shouldn\u2019t she be punished according to the disciplinary rules!\u201d Lu Feiyan questioned back in indignation.\u201cAlright, alright! Look at your friend, she\u2019s not missing an arm or a leg, is she? Case dismissed! Go back to class!\u201d The teacher standing beside Miss Wang who was more experienced quickly told Lu Feiyan.Lin Mengyu who found support now lifted her head in superiority and sneaked a mocking glance at Lu Feiyan and Yun Jian.\u2018Little bitches, hmph! This is not the end yet!\u2019\u2018Let\u2019s see what you peasants will do now that the teachers aren\u2019t on your side as well!\u2019Lu Feiyan was furious.Were the teachers blind? It was illogical yet they defended Lin Mengyu regardless!\u2018Not missing an arm or a leg?\u2019 Yun Jian had been listening from the side but she scoffed when she heard the line.True enough, this body was not missing any limbs but the original owner was indeed beaten to unconsciousness and passed away in anguish.\u201cSo one doesn\u2019t need to be punished by the school as long as no arm or leg is missing?\u201d Yun Jian asked out of the blue as she stood there listening to the chatter.The group was shocked.What did she mean?Yun Jian suddenly chuckled. She curled her finger and pointed at Lin Mengyu. \u201cShe didn\u2019t take an arm or leg off me, so I won\u2019t press the matter further.\u201dMiss Wang looked like she was relieved when she looked at Yun Jian, thinking that the girl finally comprehended the situation.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you can understand.\u201d The teacher praised Yun Jian hypocritically as she thought how could an impoverished kid compare themselves to the precious daughter of a school principal.She soon realized that she had misunderstood Yun Jian in the next second.Yun Jian took two steps toward Lin Mengyu before dashing abruptly to her side at a speed that could not visibly be caught by the others. Lifting her leg and bending it, Yun Jian kneed Lin Mengyu\u2019s stomach hard.Crack! It was the sound of a rib bone breaking! Then, Lin Mengyu\u2019s piercing cry rang.\u201cAhh!\u201dShe was currently moaning and rolling her curled up body on the floor from the pain.In spite of her injury, the rest was dumbfounded by Yun Jian\u2019s bizarre agility and speed.Lu Feiyan and the other two girls beside Lin Mengyu dropped their jaws with widened eyes staring at Yun Jian.Was - was this still the weak and submissive Yun Jian?You can also listen onLiked it?

What sort of strength was that?Could an ordinary person possess such force?Moreover, a broken rib bone in the abdomen was not something to joke about! It poses a critical health risk!The abdomen protects one\u2019s internal organs. If the broken rib bone punctured an internal organ and caused internal bleeding, the person would be in life-threatening danger!Miss Wang and another older teacher shared such common knowledge, thus both of them paled when they saw this sight.If something were to happen to Lin Mengyu here, both of them could forget about living in peace!\u201cYun Jian is it! How dare you attack and injure another student! You\u2019ll receive the most severe penalty from the school because of this!\u201d Miss Wang spat harshly in a slew of panic and fear, in addition to loathing Yun Jian.Moments after the incident had already happened, the other teacher ran out immediately to call for help to send Lin Mengyu to the hospital; she older and thereby more experienced after all. The girl was already crying in pain on the floor, unable to speak.If they were to wait any longer, she could die! It was best to send her to the hospital at once.\u201cShe didn\u2019t have to be punished because I still have my arms and legs. She also still has her limbs, so I shouldn\u2019t be punished as well.\u201d Yun Jian crossed her arms calmly and told Miss Wang looking at her in the eyes; she had struck Lin Mengyu\u2019s stomach, the latter\u2019s limbs were completely fine.Yun Jian had controlled her strength to be very light-handed. Lin Mengyu would only suffer for a while before she recovered. There was nothing life-threatening about this.\u201cYou! Just you wait for the disciplinary action from the school!\u201d Miss Wang choked from what Yun Jian said before she barked.After a moment, the older teacher who ran off came back with a few male teachers who were stronger than themselves and carried Lin Mengyu up carefully to send her to a nearby hospital.The teachers and Lin Mengyu\u2019s minions followed. All of them looked anxious, fearful that Ling Mengyu would be in great harm.Shortly, there was only Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan left in the washroom.\u201cXiao Jian, you\u2019ve injured Lin Mengyu just now and she\u2019s the daughter of our principal. If anything happens to her, the principal will surely be after you. What should we do if he expels you?\u201d Lu Feiyan was also afraid; she was only an average student and of course still frighten from witnessing the earlier episode.If a farming villager\u2019s child could not continue their studies, they could only go back to farming. In the farm villagers\u2019 words, that would be severing the only way out of such poverty-stricken life. One could give up hope to leave the village to a large city for the rest of their life.Simply put, one would be good for nothing!Yun Jian shrugged. She had controlled her strength just now. Lin Mengyu would heal in no time after some pain.Actually, if it were not for Miss Wang\u2019s grating words, she did not mind keeping Lin Mengyu\u2019s bone back in place.It seemed that there was no need for it now.\u201cShe\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Yun Jian smirked.Lin Mengyu basically killed the original owner of the body. It was already her good luck that she was not killed moments age. After all, the original owner had lost her life.A girl who was in the best time of her youth was killed just like that by Lin Mengyu\u2026Ring\u2026The bell for class rang in time just as Lu Feiyan wanted to say more.\u201cLet\u2019s go to class,\u201d said Yun Jian.She had just broken Lin Mengyu\u2019s bone. If it had been an ordinary girl who had just hurt her schoolmate, she would probably be scared out of her mind now; Yun Jian, however, spoke to Lu Feiyan calmly and exited the washroom toward the classroom.Lu Feiyan was stunned. Why did it seem that she was more worried about the consequences of Lin Mengyu\u2019s injury than Xiao Jian? She ran toward the classroom as well.Yun Jian walked in front wearing an anticipating smile.What would a place such as a school be like?She was kidnapped by the organization when she was still a young child in her previous life. After enduring through the gruesome training, her life for the past decade had been either killing people or keeping her guard up to not be killed. She had never gone to school nor had a taste of the life of a normal person.Therefore, she had high anticipations.You can also listen onLiked it?

    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Elder Brother Yun Yi and Mother\u2019s BirthdayPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationYun Jian and Lu Feiyan had just arrived at the classroom when Yun Jian caught a glimpse of the plate hanging on the wall above the doorframe. The red bold script read \u201cGrade 9 Class 6\u201d.Yun Jian was suddenly aware of her current identity, an ordinary student who had just entered ninth grade.Pressing her lips together with a raised brow, she smiled with a nod, walking into the classroom.She was seated at the third desk of the third row. The body she was in though not very tall, was not that short either; she was of average height in the class, so her assigned seat was in the middle as well.Coincidentally, it was the best seat in the classroom.Lu Feiyan was seated a little farther from her. Since the class had started, she bolted to her desk first without notifying Yun Jian.Yun Jian sat down as well. As both of them took their place, a plump female teacher came in.This was Madam Jin. Madam Jin was in her thirties but she looked a few years younger than her actual age.Madam Jin was usually friendly, being the homeroom teacher to Grade 9 Class 6, and taught them Chinese. She was engaging in her lessons and would tell the students stories, making her class a favorite among the students.Madam Jin placed her book on the lectern and took out the Chinese textbook after she entered to commence the class.As classes carried on through the afternoon, Yun Jian was not bored despite having already learned the content. She must be well versed in every subject back when she was in the organization; it included mastering all the school lessons. Otherwise, she would be eliminated in that world.In spite of it, Yun Jian had still paid attention to the class. She enjoyed the process of learning.School was dismissed punctually at 4:50pm.It was a Friday. Without the evening self-study session, dismissal was early. Self-study sessions were from Monday to Thursday, thus school dismissal time to usually be around 8pm.Before Madam Jin could announce class was dismissed, a few mischievous boys in the class had quietly snuck out with their bags from the backdoor once the bell rang. The playful bunch was a headache to the homeroom teacher but she was helpless about them.Once their teacher left, the students picked up their schoolbags and skipped home.Friday dismissal was the happiest moment of the week.\u201cXiao Jian, wait up! Let\u2019s go together!\u201d Lu Feiyan packed her things speedily and shouted at Yun Jian.Although Yun Jian made no reply, she waited for the girl.Lu Feiyan was a close friend of her current body\u2019s owner. She was a decent friend too, who tried to help when the original owner of the body was bullied and did not distance herself from Yun Jian even though it may oppose Lin Mengyu.Lu Feiyan was done packing her bag in a minute and ran over, telling Yun Jian rather excitedly, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u201cMm,\u201d Yun Jian replied softly with a nod and walked toward the school gate with Lu Feiyan.Xinjiang Town Junior High School was in the center of Xinjiang Town while Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan\u2019s houses were in the same direction. Both of them were on the same path home.Just as they stepped out of the school gate, Yun Jian heard a male voice calling out from the side, \u201cXiao Jian!\u201dSlightly surprised, she turned to see a tall teenager who was about seventeen or eighteen years old, wearing a set of tracksuit, standing on the step of the school gate looking at her.When Yun Jian saw the handsome boy, she was first lost before the memory belonging to the original owner of her body spilled into her mind.The teenager was none other than the girl\u2019s biological elder brother, Yun Yi.Now that she took over the body of the original owner, did that mean that Yun Yi was her older brother?In her previous life, Yun Jian was separated from her family at a young age. When she found them, only her younger brother remained. She had only seen her younger brother once, the latter killed before she could cherish the family bond between them.Never experiencing family love, Yun Jian looked at Yun Yi in shock before carefully uttered one word, \u201cBrother?\u201dYun Yi hopped off the step strikingly and walked over to Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan. He casually draped his arm on his younger sister\u2019s shoulder and grinned, the tug of his lips enough to make girls around them scream.\u201cMm, Xiao Jiao, your brother, me, had an early dismissal today too. So I\u2019m here to pick you up after school. Don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s mom\u2019s birthday today! She\u2019s worked hard for us all her life, we must treat her well today.\u201d Yun Yi hummed in reply before deciding to say more, afraid that Yun Jian would forget what day it was.Yun Jian had not known what was going on until she found the answer in the original owner\u2019s memory.The girl\u2019s family relationships were slightly complex. She had a biological elder brother whose excellent result in last year\u2019s high school entrance exam earned him a place in a prominent high school in the city.It was Friday and their mother\u2019s birthday. Yun Yi had told the girl earlier on that he would rush back from the city today to celebrate their mother\u2019s birthday. It was supposed to be a surprise.You can also listen onLiked it?

It\u2019s mom\u2019s birthday today.\u201d Yun Jian lied looking at Yun Yi who was bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.\u201cYup, yup. Don\u2019t I know you better? Let\u2019s go! We\u2019ll drop by the gift shop later and pick a present for mom!\u201d Yun Yi announced with a pat at Yun Jian\u2019s shoulder.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian nodded.The three of them went on their merry way to the town\u2019s gift shop.Lu Feiyan bidding them goodbye before they reached the shop as she had to go home early.Her family was stricter as her parents were both retired teachers and conceived her in their autumn years. They were very loving and had even set a house rule for Lu Feiyan to head home immediately after school; she must return home to inform them and receive their permission even if she wanted to play outside.When she heard that Yun Jian and Yun Yi were going to pick out their mother\u2019s present, she could only apologetically leave first.Yun Jian did not hold on to Lu Feiyan, resuming their way toward the gift shop with Yun Yi after the girl left.\u201cBrother, is there a telephone in town?\u201d Yun Jian asked Yun Yi not too long after it remained just the two of them.She had just been reborn to this body and was immensely content with her current life but she could not let out and just ignore everything in her previous life.Yun Jian was the ace secret agent ranked top in the list of the international charts and the boss of the Gu Sha Mercenaries.She could give up on the identity of a secret agent. After all, it was an identity that shackled her freedom. However, she could not leave Gu Sha Mercenaries stranded.The Gu Sha Mercenaries was an internationally renowned assassin organization. Its assassins could be contracted for tasks, as long as the commissioner could offer a favorable price, regardless of their nation. Since the Gu Sha Mercenaries was established, there was yet to be a mission that it could not complete as long as the commissioner could afford it.Such a mercenary organization was what Yun Jian reigned. She was the boss, the leader of it!The Gu Sha Mercenaries was a significant influence that she had gained after killing its previous boss.To revenge her younger brother\u2019s death, Yun Jian must not dispose such a powerful entity.\u201cA small shop nearby has one. Why? Do you want to make a call?\u201d Yun Yi asked after taking a suspicious glance at Yun Jian.He had taken care of his younger sister since her birth. It was until he went to high school and could only go home once every few months that he slightly lacked behind.Nonetheless, it had only been days since the semester started. Who was his younger sister going to call? Why did he, her big brother, know nothing about it?\u201cMm. I want to make a phone call. Can I, brother?\u201d asked Yun Jian.Yun Yi had always coddled his younger sister. There was no way he would reject her. \u201cOkay.\u201dHe had some allowance saved from his meals. Although telephone calls were expensive, he was willing to spend for his baby sister.Mobile phones had yet to trend in 1998\u2019s Country Z. Other than the rich, entrepreneurs, or big bosses who had communication devices like chunky cellular phones or pagers, ordinary families like the original owner of Yun Jian\u2019s body who were not very well off, could not afford to even install a telephone.Yun Jian and Yun Ji came to a small shop. The shopkeeper was a middle-aged man who was in his forties. He held a fan, fanning himself seated on a chair, as he watched the siblings enter his shop.\u201cWhat can I help you with?\u201d The shopkeeper asked casually.\u201cMister, we would like to make a phone call,\u201d Yun Yi replied.The shopkeeper adjusted the timer on the telephone and passed the receiver to Yun Yi. The latter passed it to Yun Jian, allowing her to dial.Yun Jian pressed a few digits on the receiver and waited for the call to connect.Yun Yi watched his baby sister all this while, wondering who she was calling.Tut, tut, tut\u2026Three rings later, the call connected.A smooth male voice came from the other end of the call speaking fluent English, \u201cHello?\u201dThis person was Yun Jian\u2019s underling with the moniker: Tiger.Leopard. He was one of Gu Sha Mercenaries\u2019 commanders, ranked eighth on the chart of international assassins. He was like his moniker suggests, having the savagery of a tiger and the speed of a leopard.Yun Jian stole a peek at Yun Yi before she spoke to Tiger.Leopard in eloquent English without hesitation, \u201cI\u2019m Slaying. I won\u2019t be going back for the meantime. The organization matters will be handed over to you.\u201dSlaying, known short for the Slaying God.Yun Jian did not even wait for a reply when she hung up.She had never waited for replies in her phone calls - because the other party would show absolute obedience to her of orders.When Yun Yi heard Yun Jian\u2019s articulate English, his eyes went wide staring at her.His English scored well alongside his excellent results, earning him a place in the best high school of the city, but his baby sister\u2019s result had always been lacking, especially in English.Yet Yun Jian\u2019s coherent English just now could probably triumph their English teacher who was a university graduate!Since when did his baby sister become so outstanding?Who was the person on the line, by the way? Why did Xiao Jian hang up after she spoke? It looked as if she was talking to a subordinate.The shopkeeper was still fanning himself paused when he saw what Yun Jian did.To be honest, he had been a shopkeeper for years but this was his first time seeing a crisp and young girl speaking a foreign language effortlessly in a phone call and hanging up directly without a reply.What sort of a phone call was this?Thus, the shopkeeper was dumbstruck as well.You can also listen onLiked it?

Why did you hang up right after the call connected?\u201d Unable to hold himself back, Yun Yi asked after paying the telephone fee to the shopkeeper and walked out of the shop with Yun Jian.During this trip home, he realized that his younger sister had changed a lot.Last time, Yun Jian would tell him of the things that bothered her no matter how petty. Now, Yun Jian felt like a total stranger. It was as if everything that happens now is just a part of reality.\u201cI\u2019ll tell you in the future. Don\u2019t ask now, brother,\u201d Yun Jian answered without further elaboration.She knew that she would not be able to hide the truth forever. Things would be found out sooner or later but she did not know how to convey it to Yun Yi. Could she just tell him \u201cYour biological baby sis is dead and her body is being occupied by a secret agent called Slaying God\u201d?For reasons unknown, she could not speak those words from her mouth.\u201cOkay.\u201d Yun Yi did not question her further since she did not wish to explain, but he was vigilant to keep an eye out.They left the shop and went to the gift shop to pick a present before they headed home.Yun Yi did not say more throughout the journey, so Yun Jian kept quiet as well.Twenty minutes later, both of them got home.The original owner\u2019s house did not take up much land. It was a single-story house, the second level unable to be constructed in time. There was still a piece of vacant land in front of the door. However, other than that there was nothing else.It was apparent that the family was struggling, in addition to being not doing too well.This was the truth. That was the reason the second story of this house was not built; there was simply no additional budget to complete the construction.Yun Yi went ahead and opened the door, calling out brightly, \u201cMom, we\u2019re home!\u201dYun Jian entered the house after him.She was in the top 1 percent of the world in her previous life; although daily living with either life or death, she had still lived in grandiose.In comparison to the home of her body\u2019s owner, her home was simple and plain but it was warm.\u201cXiao Yi, Xiao Jian, you guys are back huh! Dinner\u2019s ready, wash your hands and get ready!\u201d A woman in her forties urged as she walked around to place a dish on the dining table of the basic kitchen.This was the mother of Yun Jian\u2019s current body, Qin Yirou.Qin Yirou was forty-something, she was not very old yet looked well defined by age due to over exhaustion.Yun Jian stared at Qin Yirou without making a move.Mother and mother\u2019s love were concepts she had fathomed upon but had never experienced in her previous life.\u201cWhat are you doing still standing there? Wash your hands and get ready for dinner!\u201d Qin Yirou pushed when she saw Yun Jian staying rooted while looking at her.Yun Jian ran to wash her hands with a sudden rush of joy.A momentary realization flooded her mind. She had a family now. From now on, she would protect them!\u201cMom, where\u2019s dad?\u201d Yun Yi asked walking out of the kitchen after washing his hands.Yun Jian tailed him with hands still dripping wet.Qin Yirou who was setting up the cutlery halted right after Yun Yi\u2019s question.\u201cHe\u2019s not back yet,\u201d sighed Qi Yirou, \u201cHe probably went to Wang\u2019s gambling den again!\u201dYun Jian squinted.This was the reason the family of the original owner of her body was rather complicated.The original Yun Jian\u2019s mother was a worker in a textile factory. Her meager salary supported her two children to school. Her father, on the other hand, was an idle man who contributed nothing to the family. He had no job yet he loved gambling.Once he goes gambling, he would not return for nights on end. When he did come home, it was to steal the money Qin Yirou had saved for the children\u2019s schooling so he could continue gambling.This vicious cycle continued without regard to his family\u2019s situation.Consequentially, Qin Yirou was the sole breadwinner of the family.The long term toiling took a toll on Qin Yirou, causing her to look like she was in her fifties when she was only a few years past forty.\u201cDong, dong, dong!\u201dThe rapping on the door signaled that there was someone outside.It took Qin Yirou a moment before she wiped her hands and opened the door.A group of unfamiliar faces stood outside. They seemed to have ganged up as they gathered around with wooden staffs and bars in their hands, appearing the least bit friendly.\u201cWho are you looking for?\u201d Qin Yirou asked cautiously looking at the group outside.Yun Jian soundlessly walked to Qin Yirou\u2019s side and peered at the crowd outside of her house as well.The man who stood right in front of the group had a long scar running across his face; he raised the wooden stick and looked grouchily at Qin Yirou. \u201cIs this Yun Gang\u2019s house?\u201dYun Gang, the father of the original owner of Yun Jian\u2019s body, is now also her father. Yun Jian squinted.Qin Yirou had a sense of foreboding but she replied still, \u201cYes, and you guys are\u2026\u201d\u201cHeck, Yun Gang borrowed money from your father and hasn\u2019t returned any. He\u2019s nowhere to be found now!\u201d The man suddenly waved the wooden bar down toward the floor demonstrating intimidation and glared at Qin Yirou. \u201cYou\u2019re Yun Gang\u2019s wife huh!\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

She spoke uncertainly, even her voice quivered.\u201cHe\u201d was none other than Yun Gang.\u201cWho else! Yun Gang borrowed five thousand from me three months ago and promised that he\u2019ll return it today. M*therf*cker, can\u2019t even find him now!\u201d The man with a scar looked at Qin Yirou in disdain and said.It was obvious that the group of people, who accompanied the man with the scar, were hooligans.Yun Gang took a loan, did not settle it, and went into hiding. One should pay his debt; when one could not be found, however, the creditor would go to their house.If the debt was not cleared within the agreed duration, loan sharks charged an exuberant rate of interest that would snowball. Furthermore, these loan sharks would do anything to dun the debt!Yun Gang had borrowed money from them without telling her! Moreover, he had borrowed five thousand Chinese yuan! Five thousand Chinese yuan in 1998 was not a small sum!It was beyond doubt that their family condition was poor. Forget five thousand, they would not be able to settle even five hundred Chinese yuan!Now that Yun Gang had run away from his deed and left the monstrous debt, it was forcing the family to a dead end.Qin Yirou\u2019s hand flew to her chest as she shook, barely keeping balance from anger.Yun Jian held her in time. \u201cMom, are you okay?\u201dLooking at Qin Yirou, Yun Jian did not spare the men a glance.It was not that she did not care. She knew that their physical capabilities were not to be feared, although they appeared menacing with the weapons they held.Yun Yi gripped his fists. He could only suppress his rage looking at the group of men and told the man with a scar, \u201cOur family will repay the debt. Can you spare us a few more days?\u201dWhat Yun Yi was dying to do right now was to find his father and beat him up. Yet he could not do anything.His father was good-for-nothing and Yun Yi was now the only man of the house. He must consider for his mother and baby sister, he had to shoulder the responsibility for his family.He could only lower his pride to these people. What else could he do? They had such a useless father!The man with a scar on his face snorted and dug his nose, pulling out a booger. He stared at Yun Yi with a deriding gaze. \u201cHeh, a few more days? Sure!\u201dBefore Yun Yi could breathe in relief, however, the man continued. \u201cIf you let your baby sister be our company and let us have fun! Oh, lick the booger on my finger clean! Maybe I\u2019ll agree if I\u2019m happy! Hmm? Haha!\u201dTaunting him, the man wagged the booger on his finger as he spoke.The gang around him gloated laughing and looked salaciously at Yun Jian.The young girl was pretty with large eyes and a small mouth. She was incredibly youthful.Yun Yi clenched his fists but he could not lash out in fury. For his younger sister and mother, he had to endure it. He would never let his baby sister suffer even for a tiny bit!He chose the latter option.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do it!\u201d The words were squeezed through his tightened jaws, evidence of Yun Yi\u2019s current anger and indignation.The crooks in front of him broke out in laughter as they waited for the show.Yun Yi moved his long legs, planning to obey the man with a scar supposedly to satisfy them and calm down the situation, but he felt a cool sensation on his wrist before he managed to walk over.Turning around, it was Yun Jian who grabbed his hand. Her eyes were trained in front of the hooligans. Her lips curled up into a cunning yet eerie smirk.\u201cDo you guys want to try dying once?\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

She wanted to protect this body\u2019s elder brother and mother because she was Yun Jian now.This was a family connection that did not come easily.The man with a scar on his face whistled and scanned Yun Jian from head to toe, jeering, \u201cGirl\u2019s feisty. Hohoho! But I like it!\u201dThe men around him hooted as well.Yun Jian\u2019s intimidation was nothing but a joke to the group of gangsters.How dare a young girl like her speak with such tone? What else if she were not just cracking a joke?Realizing how the men were checking Yun Jian out, Yun Yi tugged his sister to his back.\u201cThis has nothing to do with my sister or my mom! Ask the money from me, I\u2019ll think of a way to return it!\u201d Yun Yi declared without any confidence.\u201cReturn it? With what?\u201d The man withdrew his smile abruptly. His gaze at Yun Yi was cruel. \u201cI want the debt paid today! Otherwise, an arm of yours for a day late!\u201dWhat? If Yun Yi were to lose his arms, how could he survive in the future? What future could he have?Qin Yirou could no longer withstand it. She charged out hopelessly to stand guard in front of both her children, shouting rather hysterically while kneeling down, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt my children! Chop my arm off if you must! It\u2019s all my fault! Please, I beg you, don\u2019t hurt my kids\u2026\u201dThe man with a scar scoffed harder.This family was interesting.Yun Jian caught Qin Yirou in time, disallowing her to actually kneel down before the gang. She passed the woman to Yun Yi and rolled up her sleeves without a word.Everyone was surprised upon seeing her prepared her fist. - What did she want to do?Lo and behold, Yun Jian walked toward the gang while she continued rolling her sleeves.\u201cHey, Bro Fan, is this little beauty volunteering as tribute now? Huh? Hahaha\u2026\u201d A man who stood beside the man with the scar looked mildly like a jibing monkey.The man with the scar on his face who was called \u201cBro Fan\u201d was Zhang Zhifan.Zhang Zhifan was the head of these crooks. The gang that Zhang Zhifan led was responsible for usury and debt dunning, resorting to copious unscrupulous deeds.As for Zhang Zhifan, he had seen enough sides to people to deem himself quite an insightful man.However, he had never met someone like Yun Jian.Yun Jian looked innocent with her fresh face but the fact was she wore a murderous look.Zhang Zhifan did not overthink, regardless. No matter how skilled Yun Jian was, she was only an underage girl who was still growing!Should the handful of men be afraid of a little girl? How would it look on them if they were?Just as Zhang Zhifan decided to ignore Yun Jian and debilitate Yun Yi\u2019s arm as intimidation, he was completely shocked by Yun Jian\u2019s next move.Rolling up her sleeves, Yun Jian wore a slight smile.She took two steps forward and her arms lithely wrapped around the monkey-lookalike beside Zhang Zhifan. Wrenching his wrist, she hauled the man up and threw him down on the floor in180 degrees.The speed and violence the girl possessed dropped everyone\u2019s jaws.Was this a human speed? Was a little girl supposed to have such strength?She had just picked someone up and heaved him down!How powerful must she be to be able to do that?You can also listen onLiked it?

With a shudder, he then passed out.The rest of the gang felt chills down their spines from the sight of him losing consciousness.Qin Yirou stared at her daughter in disbelief while Yun Yi squinted thoughtfully despite also being shocked by his younger sister.\u201cYou - you\u2026\u201d Zhang Zhifan completely lost his cool when Yun Jian slowly approached him after throwing the monkey-like man on the ground.He condescended Yun Jian previously, thinking that she was only a child. Now, however, with the fainted monkey face man, the gang shut up immediately shaking in fear.They saw clearly how the man had ended up on the floor just now and he was the deftest one of all of them.Yet Yun Jian\u2019s speed was several times faster than him!If they could not catch Yun Jian\u2019s movement by eyes, how could they fight her?As Yun Jian approached closer to Zhang Zhifan, she stopped and looked up at him. Her pretty eyes had a piercing gaze that showed no hint of fear.\u201cI\u2019ll pay my father\u2019s debt.\u201d Yun Jian said nothing else more.The gang subconsciously breathed a sigh of relief. They were afraid of Yun Jian but they also felt that she was someone who would break her promise.When Zhang Zhifan thought that everything was over, Yun Jian\u2019s cold voice rang again. \u201cBut don\u2019t think of leaving here just like this. My brother and mother have been scared because of you guys. If you don\u2019t apologize, I\u2019ll cripple each pair of your arms on the spot!\u201dZhang Zhifan had threatened to break Yun Yi\u2019s arm on behalf of Yun Gang\u2019s debt just now. An eye for an eye, Yun Jian was just their words back at them!Zhang Zhifan and his lackeys widened their eyes. She wanted to break their arms if they did not apologize just because her brother and mother were frightened. After what happened just now, they completely believed that Yun Jian could enact her threat.However, they did not know that when Yun Jian was still a secret agent under the moniker Slaying God, what she would ask for was not as simple as a pair of arms - it would be their lives.\u201cXiao Jian, come back. It\u2019s okay. Your brother and I are fine, we aren\u2019t frightened\u2026\u201dQin Yirou was mild-tempered. She was also worried that Zhang Zhifan and gang would find backup and harm her daughter if she continued arguing.It was impossible that crooks like Zhang Zhifan who earned from usuries all year long with no family support. If they were offended, Yun Jian would really be in danger if they came again.Yun Jian did not turn back to look at Qin Yirou but had listened to what she said.\u201cSince my mom has spoken, you guys can get lost.\u201d She glanced up at the gang.Then, she chuckled looking at them. \u201cRemember, it\u2019s my father Yun Gang who owes you money. I\u2019ll clear his debt this time but if there\u2019s a next time, find him dead or alive. It\u2019s his fault anyway. Don\u2019t come to my house again!\u201dThe gang felt their eyes twitching.The little girl had a bold mouth.No matter how useless Yun Gang was, he was still her father.

Fortunately, Yun Yi had held on to her.To a woman, infidelity was the most unforgivable action. Other than this, gambling and infidelity were similar; a fun game or two was a mood booster but gambling addition was harmful.Yun Gang did not commit adultery but he was hooked on gambling and without a proper job. Qin Yirou had been the sole breadwinner these years and kept the family afloat all on her own.Moreover, her hard-earned money was sometimes stolen by Yun Gang who continued gambling.Qin Yirou could turn a blind eye to all these, believing that it would all pass if she held on. Perhaps, she could live with it.Who would have thought that Yun Gang resorted to the loan sharks!He was pushing his family to a dead end!The loan sharks could do anything!If it were not for Xiao Jian\u2019s fierce retaliation today which chased the gang away, the consequences were unimaginable.Qin Yirou did not ponder the sudden change of her daughter, her mind was too cluttered to think about it. This was the first time she thought of divorcing Yun Gang.If this went on, Yun Gang would only drag Xiao Jian and Xiao Yi down with him.She must not keep living like this.Yun Jian quietly went to Qin Yirou and looked at the woman she called mother. For some reason, her heart ached for her. She knew that this was not her own feelings, however, probably the original owner\u2019s remnants of love.\u201cMom, you still have me and brother. We\u2019ll stay together from now on!\u201d As for their so-called father, Yun Jian would not be merciful since he was heartless.Yun Jian spoke with assertion looking at Qin Yirou and Yun Yi, causing the woman\u2019s mood to become better.\u201cMm!\u201d Qin Yirou pulled out her hand to gripping Yun Jian\u2019s tightly. Some color reemerged from her pale face as she nodded.Even if Qin Yirou did not comment on what Yun Gang has done, she definitely despised it.As dinner progressed, she remained silent. When Yun Yi presented their gift to her, she wore only a slight smile too.There was an inexplicable bitter taste in her heart.Yun Jian could not empathize with Qin Yirou\u2019s current pain, the suffering of an ordinary woman.The night passed without words.The next day was Saturday. Yun Jian woke up incredibly early and placed anything heavy into her schoolbag which now weighed over ten kilograms and ran a few laps around Xinjiang Town\u2019s river carrying the bag.Fitness training was her routine in her previous life.In spite of it, this body was not at all fit. After a few rounds of weighted running, she was sweating profusely.If it had been her in the previous life, she could run carrying a person, forget ten plus kilograms, around the river without a harsh pant.When the sky turned cloudy in the afternoon, Lu Feiyan asked Yun Jian to hang out at a park nearby.It was then when Yun Jian recalled that the original owner of her body had promised Lu Feiyan that they would take a stroll around the park this weekend.The park was small but it was quite famous among the people of Xinjiang Town. People came here to walk when the weather was nice.When it turned cloudy this Saturday afternoon, it marked good weather for a stroll.The small park was quite busy when Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan arrived.\u201cXiao Jian, let\u2019s have a seat over there at the pavilion!\u201d Lu Feiyan told Yun Jian after they made several rounds in the park.\u201cSure.\u201d With a nod from Yun Jian, both girls went the spot.There were already people standing in the pavilion but there was still space. Yet when they came close, Lu Feiyan suddenly exclaimed, \u201cEh, isn\u2019t that\u2026\u201dShe pointed at a teenage boy sitting in the pavilion.Yun Jian\u2019s eyes followed her friend\u2019s finger directing her to a young boy in a white t-shirt who was rather good looking sitting on the stone bench. He was surrounded by other teenagers.The boy was none other than the culprit who caused the original owner of Yun Jian\u2019s body to be accidentally killed by Lin Mengyu, it was Yuan Yingjun.Enemies were bound to meet. Yun Jian smirked. Right when she was about to turn away, Yuan Yingjun\u2019s surprised voice sounded from behind. \u201cXiao Jian? You\u2019re here\u2026 for a walk too? Or are you here to meet me?\u201dHis tone grew with certainty when he got to the end of his sentence.You can also listen onLiked it?

I\u2019m only here for a walk. What does it have to do with me whether you\u2019re here or not?\u201dYun Jian was straight to the point as it was the truth.If it had been the other Yun Jian, the original owner of the body, she probably dared not say anything even if she was accused.That was why Lin Mengyu would assume that it was her who enticed Yuan Yingjun and not the other way round instead.However, that was also how her revival happened.\u201cHmph, who doesn\u2019t know how to play hard to get, Yun Jian? Do you think that Yingjun will take a second look at you like this? Dream on!\u201d Before Yuan Yingjun spoke, a short and plump girl who wore thick makeup stood beside the boy, spitting at Yun Jian in hostility.The plump girl was obviously Yuan Yingjun\u2019s admirer.Knowing that Lin Mengyu was sent to the hospital, Yun Jian did not expect that Yuan Yingjun to be having fun in the park with others, instead of taking care of her girlfriend.\u201cHeh.\u201d Yun Jian\u2019s icy gaze flickered; not wanting to be acquainted with these people, she turned to tug Lu Feiyan with the intention to leave.She did not want to interact with a boy like this at all, who was basically a playboy.Lu Feiyan was stunned at Yun Jian\u2019s reaction.Xiao Jian used to hide behind her and was unable to retort when they encountered situations like this in the past but she had fought back today!\u201cStand right there, you two, don\u2019t move! Or else I\u2019ll act rough! I\u2019ll really hit you!\u201d The plump girl was instantly angered when she saw that Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan were going to leave without even a glimpse at her.The girl was the daughter of Xinjiang Town\u2019s mayor, Shu Li. She was known to harass others, taking advantage of her father\u2019s position.It was again the typical spoiled brat behavior, as everyone in the town submitted her.Just now, however, the girl called Yun Jian had actually opposed her!She was going to leave without a sound too.This was a slap to Shu Li\u2019s pride, so she shouted without thinking twice.Yun Jian ignored Shu Li\u2019s continuous threat and went much farther with Lu Feiyan before turning back.\u201cAnd who are you? Why must I stand still just because you ask me to?\u201d Yun Jian scoffed.She was the dominator of the secret agent sphere, the sole command of the world\u2019s largest mercenary organization. Countless bigshots, tycoons, and politicians felt crippling fear just from hearing her name.Yet the daughter of a small town mayor dared speak to her in this tone. Since when would the Slaying God be manipulated in fear? Even if there were one, the person was already dead now!Yuan Yingjun who had not moved showed a charming smile, thinking that Yun Jian was really playing tricks.\u2018Hard to get?\u2019Yun Jian looked quite the part but it caused Yuan Yingjun to desire this girl even more. There was still time. He refused to believe that this girl would not be charmed by his good looks and send herself his wayYuan Yingjun had completely forgotten that he still had a girlfriend, who was still being treated in the hospital. He had also forgotten that the person who caused the incident was none other than Yun Jian, whom he thought was attracting him by playing hard to get!You can also listen onLiked it?

How dare you talk to me like that! Hmph! Careful, I\u2019ll make your life a misery!\u201d Shu Li spewed nonsense whilst in panic.Yun Jian could no longer hold herself back from laughing.Why were these children born with a silver spoon all the same?Shu Li\u2019s words were like a carbon copy to what Lin Mengyu had said previously. The only difference was that Lin Mengyu\u2019s father was a school principal and Shu Li\u2019s father was a mayor.Subjectively, both of them were the same.\u201cShould I be afraid?\u201d Yun Jian crossed her arms and stared at Shu Li strangely.In an era where influence and family background were significant, it would be a miracle if the original owner of Yun Jian\u2019s body could live in peace; given she was up against such families of powerful status.Yun Jian now was not like the original however. She refused to remain quiet when she was accused and bullied.\u201cXiao Jian, stop pretending. You\u2019ve successfully gotten my attention. You can tell us if you want to hang out together. We welcome the both of you very much,\u201d Yuan Yingjun told Yun Jian looking as though he knew her true intent after shaking his hair.He had assumed all that Yun Jian had said just now was her playing hard to get.To Yuan Yingjun, Yun Jian must have spent a lot of effort to act so convincingly.It matched his intention, nonetheless, as he had been wanting to date Yun Jian.The girl was pretty, many times more compared to Lin Mengyu who had no looks or shape. If Lin Mengyu was not the principal\u2019s daughter, he would never have dated her.As for Yun Jian, Yuan Yingjun only wanted to toy with her, tossing her away after he grew bored of her. That was all.\u201cSorry, I don\u2019t hang out with pigs.\u201d Yun Jian beamed as her striking grin sneaked an attack like a rose\u2019s prick.Pigs? She had compared them to pigs!Yuan Yingjun\u2019s face fell in the next second. Was Yun Jian obsessed with her acting? What else did she want when he had already invited her?Shu Li cussed at Yun Jian at once. \u201cYou\u2019re the pig! Your whole family is from the stinking drain! How could a person like you still live in this world? And to think about enticing Yingjun, why don\u2019t you look in the mirror first?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t name anyone but if you guys want to volunteer, I guess the metaphor is owned now,\u201d Yun Jian replied faintly with a smirk.Yuan Yingjun and Shu Li paled once they heard her, caught at an awkward moment.\u201cAh! There\u2019s a snake! A snake!\u201dLu Feiyan screamed from the back all of a sudden.Yun Jian turned to follow where Lu Feiyan\u2019s shaking finger was pointing and saw a snake that was about half a meter long. It slithered in a bush less than half a meter away from the both of them. It was yellowish brown yet had a greyish black tinge with an oval head; its head was raised with its neck spread flat like a spoon.Lu Feiyan shrieked once she caught a glimpse of the venomous snake that had just come out of the bushes.Yun Jian\u2019s senses were still working well. Long before her friend cried in horror, she had sensed the movement in the bushes after she jabbed back at Yuan Yingjun and his clique.However, she had only known that it was a snake after taking a look despite having predicted so.\u201cIs - is that a cobra?\u201d A boy who wore a pair of glasses with a large frame standing beside Yuan Yingjun shouted in surprise pointing at the serpent.The park was not exactly huge. Furthermore, it was summer. There were inevitably snakes but this one was a cobra!Cobras are a highly venomous snake! One would die if bitten and not sent immediately to the hospital!Yuan Yingjun and friends stood a little farther, they were afraid as well.

It was not unusual to see a snake or two in the park but to meet a cobra was honestly bad luck.The dark grey cobra slid out of the bushes slowly and stood up in threat. Its hood expanded while it hissed.Yun Jian squinted as she pulled Lu Feiyan behind her quietly.The cobra\u2019s head was up, it was prepared to attack.\u201cXiao Jian! You\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Lu Feiyan was both touched and worried when she was pulled back; crying out, \u201cBe careful\u2026\u201d Yun Jian became the one facing the cobra directly.One must not run or at least run in a straight line when facing a snake because the snake would chase after you like that.Yuan Yingjun and his clique who were farther back were frozen in fright. They neither dared move in the pavilion nor breathe heavily, terrified that the cobra would notice them.The majority of people innately feared snakes.In addition, this was a cobra. An actual venomous snake! One would die once if bitten.When Yuan Yingjun and the others saw how Yun Jian pulled Lu Feiyan behind to protect her, their eyes widened in astonishment. They then saw Yun Jian training her gaze on the cobra in full alertness.Was she planning to fight the venomous cobra alone?Just thinking about the possibility was enough to give one goosebumps.The snake slithered, its head bobbing up and down. Even if it were professional snake catchers, they would require tools to be able to catch the snakes. How could a person catch one with just their bare hands?As Yuan Yingjun and his clique inspected the situation, they felt a looming sense of danger, imagining Yun Jian might be bitten in the next second. Then, the cobra suddenly moved toward Yun Jian.Its coiled body stretched in the next moment and shot toward Yun Jian, attacking whoever was the nearest straight line target.\u201cNo! Xiao Jian!\u201dLu Feiyan screamed with a sob, witnessing Yun Jian replace her as the cobra\u2019s target. Just as she was about to push Yun Jian away, instinctively wanting to take the strike for her friend, a baffling scene unfolded before them all\u2026Yun Jian\u2019s lips were tugged in an upward angle as she stood tall in front of the cobra watching it draw itself back before springing toward her.She stretched her arms simultaneously.It was like she knew the next direction of the cobra\u2019s attack as her hands swung.Yun Jian\u2019s hand had precisely choked the cobra\u2019s neck at a speed that the human eyes could not perceive. She prevented the snake from biting her while her other hand swiftly moved to the weakest point of the cobra, exactly seven inches down where its heart was and clenched it without mercy.The cobra struggled in a frenzy before it was shortly squeezed to death by Yun Jian.Yun Jian had just grabbed the venomous snake with her bare hands and clasped it to death!Her movements were simple but they evoked various emotions in those watching.That was a highly venomous snake! Yet it was killed by Yun Jian in a direct confrontation!In addition, Yun Jian\u2019s swift actions demonstrated she had undergone countless practice.Even when she had killed a venomous serpent, her gaze showed no fear.How could an ordinary student possess such skill and ability? - Even an adult would be shocked frozen in encountering a venomous snake.Yun Jian, however, had killed it without batting an eye!This caused Lu Feiyan, Yuan Yingjun and the rest to look at her in a stupor.You can also listen onLiked it?

The current Yun Jian appeared to be a murderous devil out of hell. - This was the instant thought of Yuan Yingjun and the others.In all honesty, Yun Jian was not pretending. As a secret agent in her past life, she was numbed by assassination; she had become the sole survivor by stepping on countless corpses. When she was trained by the organization in her early years, hundreds of people including herself were thrown into a wild forest of an island without being given anything.Life or death, it depended completely on themselves.The uncivilized jungle was full of venomous scorpions, snakes, bugs, and wild beasts. A careless move would send one straight to death.For a full year, she had stayed on the island living together with the venomous and untamed. She endured, becoming one of the survivors.This was why she was adept at tackling the cobra. The fatal point of a snake was seven inches away from its head where its heart was. It was things like these that Yun Jian was familiar with.\u201cXiao Jian\u2026 You - you\u2026\u201d Lu Feiyan subconsciously stepped back as she looked at Yun Jian in disbelief.Was this still her best friend Xiao Jian?The Xiao Jian now had killed a venomous snake all on her own. - This was not the Xiao Jian who used to run away upon seeing a cockroach!Yun Jian did not know if Lu Feiyan was suspicious of her but she could feel the fear the girl exuded due to her previous stunt, a distancing sense of fear.Raising her eyebrow, Yun Jian asked Lu Feiyan coldly, \u201cAre you afraid of me?\u201d\u201cNo, no! I\u2019m not! Xiao Jian, I\u2019m just -\u201d Lu Feiyan shook her head vehemently but her speech was cut short by Yun Jian.\u201cNot everyone is okay with staying weak. I used to be feeble and useless but from now on, I\u2019ll be how I was like today,\u201d Yun Jian stated whilst maintaining eye contact with Lu Feiyan.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, don\u2019t hang out with me anymore.\u201d She added.It was not that Yun Jian was cold-blooded; her previous life\u2019s circumstances had made her what she was today. Moreover, she would return to her previous life\u2019s environment sooner or later. - She had yet to avenge her baby brother\u2019s death!If Lu Feiyan chose to distance herself, it was probably a good thing.\u201cNo!\u201d Lu Feiyan jogged up and grabbed Yun Jian\u2019s hand tightly. Her determined gaze was shining. \u201cXiao Jian, no matter how you change, you\u2019re still my best friend, for life. I\u2019m just a little surprised just now.\u201dTaking in Lu Feiyan\u2019s resolute gaze, Yun Jian nodded conclusively.Lu Feiyan was just an ordinary ninth grader. She had just ruthlessly killed a cobra, so it was normal that Lu Feiyan found it hard to accept in a short period of time.In spite of it, Lu Feiyan\u2019s decision to continue being friends with her after witnessing her savage side was out of Yun Jian\u2019s expectation.Subsequently, Yuan Yingjun and his clique watched Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan leave the park together without the courage to stop them.

Her Mother\u2019s AccidentPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationAfter Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan left the park, they each went home respectively.Today was Saturday. Qin Yirou was still working overtime in the textile factory at this time.When Yun Jian arrived home, she saw Yun Yi sitting at the single table of the living room. A workbook was spread open on the table, as her elder brother had a pen slotted between his fingers, a frown locked in place as he tried to figure out his homework problem.Her brother Yun Yi had always done well in his studies and had even scored high enough to admit into one of the most prominent high schools in the city. He was the pride of the family.The original owner of Yun Jian\u2019s current body, on the other hand, was the opposite of her brother; she was one of those children who were known to do badly in class and were not regarded highly by teachers in the school.Although both of them were biological siblings, their academic results were heaven and earth apart.\u201cBrother,\u201d Yun Jian called out whilst approaching him.\u201cHey, Xiao Jian. You\u2019re back?\u201d Yun Yi retracted his studious gaze from the workbook and turned to look at his sister.\u201cYou\u2019re going back to school in the city tomorrow, right? I want to go to the city with you too.\u201d Yun Jian expressed her wish.The father of her body\u2019s original owner was in debt and Yun Jian had promised Zhang Zhifan that she would clear that debt. She was not one to break her promise.Now that she was in need of money, she needed to go to the city.There were too few opportunities here in a rural place like Xinjiang Town.\u201cWhy do you suddenly want to go to the city? Do you want to buy something, Xiao Jian? I can buy it for you and bring it back the next time?\u201d Yun Yi dropped the pen he was holding to fully face Yun Jian.\u201cBrother, I want to go too\u2026\u201d Yun Jian knew that Yun Yi pampered his baby sister and she did not know how to explain her true intentions, thus she copied the original owner\u2019s actions and shook Yun Yi\u2019s arm in acting cute.\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Yun Yi could only agree helplessly as he was always fond of his younger sister and was defenseless against her charm.Taking Yun Jian to the city meant burning another hole in his allowance. After all, the fare and other expenses included in the trip were not cheap, hence he would not only return home once every few months since studying there.Nevertheless, it was worth it to spend for his sister.\u201cMmm-mmm.\u201d Yun Jian beamed.Unable to experience family love in her previous life, Yun Jian felt that her revival in this life, which gave her both the love of a mother and an elder brother who coddled her, was truly wonderful.\u2026The time had passed to 5:30pm, Qin Yirou was supposed to have finished work and come home for dinner. As 6:00pm ticked and the sky gradually darkened, she was not home yet.The textile factory that Qin Yirou worked in was not far, about ten minutes\u2019 walk from their house.Usually, the latest she was home would be 5:50pm, but that was not the case today.Yun Yi could no longer sit still when it was 6:20pm. Why was his mother not home yet?Had something happened to her?Standing up immediately with the thought, Yun Yi told Yun Jian, \u201cBe good and stay home. I\u2019ll go check why mom\u2019s not yet home.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go too,\u201d Yun Jian stood up and said as Yun Yi was heading out. The latter did not refuse her.It had been about three minutes since both of them headed towards the direction of the textile factory when a plumpish woman in her forties was rushing shakily toward them.She was their neighbor, her family name Wang; people called her Aunt Wang.Aunt Wang and Qin Yirou worked in the same factory and usually returned home together since they lived near each other.Why was she rushing back alone today?Yun Jian looked up as Yun Yi stepped forward and asked, \u201cAunt Wang, why isn\u2019t my mom home yet when it\u2019s already so late\u2026\u201dAunt Wang\u2019s voice trembled with a sympathetic sob and lingering fear, interrupted by Yun Yi before he finished his question.\u201cYour mother\u2019s arm was injured by the machine - in an accident just now. Her arm - it\u2019s all blood, blood! Her meridians are hurt too\u2026 The doctor said that her arm might not be recovered\u2026 Go quickly, go to her!\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

Qin Yirou was one of them.It was not that the textile factory paid well, but wages were still much higher compared to those who farmed for a living.Certainly, there were pros and cons.Workers in the textile factory worked with machines. Careless scrapes and hand injury was a daily occurrence. More severely, there were cases where employees accidentally broke their fingers in half.In the original Yun Jian\u2019s family, both her and Yun Yi were students and their father was good for nothing who knew only to gamble. It was expected that Qin Yirou carried an immense burden.Before Yun Jian was revived into this body, the original Yun Jian and Yun Yi had been opposing Qin Yirou\u2019s decision to work at the textile factory.What could they have done though? The family expenditure was high. If Qin Yirou had opted for the safer option of farming, it would be insufficient to support the children\u2019s schooling.Now, the risk they had been worried about eventually still occurred. Qin Yirou accidentally hurt herself and by Aunt Wang\u2019s tone, her injury seemed serious!Qin Yirou was injured! Yun Jian\u2019s heart sank and an inexplicable worry flooded her.She did not occupy this body for a long time but she had taken both Qin Yirou and Yun Yi as her own family.\u201cWhere\u2019s my mom now?\u201d asked Yun Jian.\u201cShe - she\u2019s at our town hospital\u2026\u201d Aunt Wang was still quite dazed from the scare.Before Aunt Wang finished her words, Yun Jian ran toward the largest hospital in Xinjiang Town.Yun Yi ran with her, fear filled his heart after hearing Aunt Wang\u2019s words. He was afraid that Qin Yirou\u2019s situation was grave.There were a few clinics in Xinjiang Town but there was only one sizeable hospital.Yun Jian was in a rush, her pace incredibly fast, creating a long distance between her and Yun Yi. Yun Yi was not in the mood to consider this oddity as he sprinted toward the same destination.Entering the hospital entrance, Yun Jian stood herself in front of the counter almost instantly, unknowingly giving the receptionist a scare.\u201cWhere\u2019s the person who was sent here just now for injuring her hand?\u201d Yun Jian asked directly.The receptionist took a moment to react, pointing at an aisle. \u201cI saw her being sent to the emergency room over there\u2026\u201dYun Jian disappeared right before her, halfway through her reply. Yun Jian\u2019s speed completely invisible, causing the receptionist to rub her eyes in astonishment.A tall middle-aged man was seen pacing back and forth with a frown outside of the emergency ward.He was the textile factory\u2019s supervisor, Gao Jian.Qin Yirou was his factory worker. If her injury was serious, the factory would possibly be held responsible; if the worker was a troublesome character, a huge amount of compensation and the likes would be requested. Therefore, Go Jian was extremely anxious.Just as Gao Jian stomped his foot, a delicate looking girl appeared in front of him all of a sudden and grabbed his collar.\u201cWhere\u2019s Qin Yirou?\u201d Yun Jian questioned curtly pulling at Gao Jian\u2019s collar.Gao Jian was already tensed but seeing Yun Jian now, he knew that Aunt Wang had already informed Qin Yirou\u2019s family. He understood the situation and replied, \u201cYou\u2019re Qin Yirou\u2019s family? She\u2019s inside the emergency ward for an operation but the doctor says that her state\u2026 isn\u2019t very positive.\u201dThe doctor said that Qin Yirou\u2019s hands were probably ruined and it was highly likely that they would have to be amputated. The injury was so severe that she had already passed out.However, Gao Jian did not tell the girl the end of it. If he did, the girl might not be able to take it.Right as Gao Jian finished talking, the doors to the emergency ward opened in time. A doctor in white robe walked out and looked grimly at Yun Jian and Gao Jian.\u201cWho\u2019s the patient\u2019s family? The patient\u2019s state is not good. The injury is too grave. Our hospital\u2019s facilities aren\u2019t fully equipped as well. It\u2019s too late to send her to the city\u2019s hospital now. The current best solution is amputation. Otherwise, her life might be at stake.\u201dXinjiang Town was a small town with inadequate medical facilities. It was around 1998 too, so the journey to send a patient from the town to the city was not a short one. The patient would probably have died upon arrival.The doctors were powerless, thus resorting to this ill method.Amputation! All hope was gone!Gao Jian felt chills when he heard the word.It was not like he was worried about Qin Yirou. It was because the factory had to recompense her. Amputated hands meant that they had to remunerate her more!Yun Jian glanced coldly at the doctor and walked over to him without a change of expression. \u201cGive way if you have poor medical skills.

Nonsense! Is a human\u2019s life child\u2019s play? Can a little girl like you do what we doctors can\u2019t? Are you playing around?\u201dHow old was the girl? Fifteen? Sixteen?She probably did not know the most basic medical knowledge. - Surgeon?One must know that the life and death of a patient undergoing operation depended on the surgeon.Letting her be the surgeon was basically ridiculous!\u201cYes, yes. I know you\u2019re worried now but it can\u2019t be helped, little girl. The accident\u2019s happened and the doctors are surely doing their best!\u201d Gao Jian quickly joined the doctor\u2019s side.Qin Yirou\u2019s state was still what Gao Jian was the most fretful about.Even if Qin Yirou\u2019s hands were amputated, the factory would just reimburse her more. If they let this little girl do what she wanted, what if the woman died as a consequence?That would be a fatality! It was not a matter that could be brushed off by giving compensation.\u201cI\u2019ll bear all responsibility no matter what happens!\u201dThere was no time for chatter at this juncture of time. Qin Yirou\u2019s grave injury did not allow Yun Jian time. Each ticking second and passing minute was crucial to her.Yun Jian pushed the doctor away after the declaration and marched through the emergency doors.\u201cHey, hey, hey! You!\u201d The doctor stumbled from the push, surprised at the girl\u2019s unexpected strength, before he quickly ran in after her.As Yun Jian stepped into the operation room, Yun Yi who had been trying to catch up to Yun Jian, futilely arriving at the hospital as well.Yun Jian was already in the emergency ward.\u201cHey, where did this little girl come from? Why is she here in the operation room? The surgery is ongoing, a life is at stake. Take her out!\u201d A few serious looking assistant doctors standing beside the operation theater were quick to chase the intruder out.\u201cI\u2019ll pick up the operation as the surgeon now.\u201d Yun Jian announced suddenly without allowing the others to object. From the side cabinet, she picked up and wore the surgical gown the doctor had left just now and slide sterile gloves on before walking over to the operation theater.The attending assistant doctors and the doctor who had ran in after Yun Jian saw how fluid and natural her process of donning the professional attire was and could not help widening their eyes.Was this really a teenage girl?Her movement was as fluent as a medical veteran!As they pondered, Yun Jian had already come to the operation theater to have a look at Qin Yirou who had been unconscious for a long time.Qin Yirou\u2019s hands were severely injured by the machinery. It was not an exaggeration to call her hands mashed. The blood was stopped but her hands did not look good.Yun Jian could not help the pang to her heart when she saw her condition. This was the original owner\u2019s emotion. Yun Jian blinked before she stepped forth without hesitation to continue the surgery.She was not only an ace in the secret agent sphere, she was an outstanding elite in the medical field.In her previous life, her medical skills were marvelous, earning her quite some fame in the medical field. Even to be called the Grim Reaper\u2019s Hands by her peers. As long as the patient was still breathing, she could rescue them; that had been the usual case.The hospital of Xinjiang Town did not house a high standard of medical expertise. If she were not here today, an amputation would be inevitable for Qin Yirou. - This was, if Yun Jian did not do anything.She was definitely going to save the woman!You can also listen onLiked it?

Stop messing around. I know that you must have jumbled feelings looking at the patient\u2019s current state but since the incidents already happened, we\u2019ll do our best to save her. Please do go out first, alright?\u201d The doctor who ran in after Yun Jian patiently advised again.It was after a moment of contemplation that the doctor assumed that Yun Jian was acted this way because she could not accept the sudden strike of reality.The patient must be related to her and the shock must have been too much for the young lady to act rationally.Amputating both hands was indeed something hard to accept, but the doctors thought that this was the only way to save Qin Yirou.\u201cShe\u2019s my mother,\u201d Yun Jian suddenly spoke up and continued speaking calmly, \u201cDo you guys think that I\u2019ll joke around with my mother\u2019s life?\u201dIt was because she was confident that she decided to handle things her way.It was impossible for her to watch Qin Yirou\u2019s hands being severed and for her to fall into the lowest phase of her life without the capability to do anything. She could not bear to let it happen.\u201cSo please assist me in this surgery!\u201d Yun Jian raised her voice and shocked the medical professionals around her once more.Perhaps, due to the fact that Qin Yirou was her mother; no matter if she was misbehaving or how stubborn the girl was, she would never joke with her mother\u2019s life!Perhaps, it was due to Yun Jian\u2019s words; maybe it was her extraordinary confidence and demeanor.After a two-second pause. The doctor who had been consoling her, and the attending assistant doctors indeed said nothing and moved to their respective positions.Yun Jian took over the surgeon\u2019s position and continued the operation!The doctors on the spot were certain that allowing a fifteen or sixteen year old girl to take charge of the surgery was unprecedented and the craziest thing to ever happen.Qin Yirou had injured her hands and the injury had extended to her meridians. It required stitching in addition to consideration of various other aspects.With the limited medical equipment, no doctor in the operation ward was able to fully repair Qin Yirou\u2019s hands. What more could this young girl do?In spite of it, the trained and proficient medical skills that Yun Jian showed completely baffled them.\u201cSurgical forceps.\u201d\u201cTowel clamp.\u201d\u201cSuture needle.\u201d\u2026Yun Jian\u2019s mechanical requests for surgical instruments were responded by the attending assistant doctors immediately passing the tools to her.Stitching, making incisions, stitching again\u2026 Each action was flawlessly executed.When the suture needle finally stitched the last of Qin Yirou\u2019s wound marking the end of the operation, the doctors could not believe what they had just witnessed.\u201cThe operation was successfully completed!\u201d The doctor shakily announced what they had thought to be impossible.It was really completed!When the professionals turned again to look at the young lady, respect was all there was in their eyes.The surgery was actually a success!Oh my God! How old was the girl!They had thought that a young girl like her would have been terrified upon seeing the bloody wound of Qin Yirou. Instead, she was cool as a cucumber.They had thought that her statement to take over the surgeon\u2019s place was nonsense.

Gao Jian who was beside him mirrored him.Although both of them were overwrought, they knew that they could not simply enter the operation room.What Yun Yi was also curious about was that he had heard from Gao Jian that Xiao Jian had gone inside for a long time; no one knew what she was doing inside and she was still not out yet.His mother\u2019s life or death were unknown behind the doors and he could only wait futilely outside. The uncertainty was working Yun Yi up.\u201cCreak.\u201dThe doors of the operation ward that had been tightly shut opened.The doctor they had seen earlier stepped out first with a relaxed expression. There was even a slight joy on his face.\u201cDoctor, how\u2019s my mom?\u201d Yun Yi rushed to ask.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d The doctor feigned his composure and announced. \u201cThe surgery was a success. The patient is doing well as of now. I believe that her hands will be good as new in a few months\u2019 time!\u201dGood as new? Gao Jian was stunned.Since the beginning, this doctor had said that Qin Yirou\u2019s life would be at stake if her hands were not amputated.Yet a while after Yun Jian forced her way into the operation room, this doctor had come out declaring that the patient was fine and her impairment could fully recover!Could Yun Jian really be so skilled?Yun Yi let out a huge breath of relief. Thank god his mother was alright.Yun Jian took off the surgical gown and sterile gloves before she exited the room. To prevent her brother from worrying, she made the doctor deliver the good news.At the same time, she came to a consensus with the doctors that she could teach them her skills if they kept it a secret that she completed the surgery.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, brother.\u201d Yun Jian comforted gently, looking at Yun Yi\u2019s face that was drained of color.\u2026When Qin Yirou woke up at 5:30am the next day, she was not as pale as she had looked anymore. A slight hue restored to her.Yun Jian peeled and cut an apple before feeding Qin Yirou piece by piece, softly reminding her, \u201cEat slowly, mom.\u201dQin Yirou felt as if she had just escaped death. With a misty-eyed smile, she was content to see that her daughter was mature and thoughtful.Yun Yi had gone back to his school in the city for the evening self-study session that afternoon, but only after Qin Yirou\u2019s drawn persuasion.He wanted to apply leave from the school, to stay and take care of his mother but Qin Yirou rejected him, afraid that he would not be able to keep up with his studies.Whatever the patient demanded was the decree. - Qin Yirou\u2019s wish was Yun Yi\u2019s command. Furthermore, the doctor had said that Qin Yirou was doing excellent now, outside of the dangerous phase, so Yun Yi went back to the city.Yun Jian had wanted to go with him but she could only postpone her plan now.Since the accident, her so-called father, Yun Gang, had never appeared.This made Yun Jian loathed him even more.Having made dinner at home, Yun Jian bought it to the hospital.Any fee regarding Qin Yirou\u2019s hospitalization was settled by Gao Jian on behalf of the factory. It was heartening that the factory was accountable.To nourish Qin Yirou\u2019s weakened body, Yun Jian made chicken soup.However, she heard a sharp and pushy voice of a female once she was near Qin Yirou\u2019s room.\u201cOh Yirou, I\u2019m not intentionally putting you in a tough spot.

The Annoying Aunt (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationAs Yun Jian turned into the room, she saw a few people standing beside Qin Yirou\u2019s bed.As she entered a snobbish female voice came from a woman who was standing close, she was dressed extravagantly. She was in her forties but looked like she had just passed thirty because she maintained herself well.The woman was none other than her aunt, Qin Yirou\u2019s elder sister, Qin Junlan.They were probably here to visit Qin Yirou since she got into an accident, the intentions of their visit were blatant.\u201cMom, I made you dinner. It\u2019s in the thermal lunchbox.\u201d Yun Jian took only a glance at the visitors and walked in to open the lunchbox by the bed. Ignoring the visitors as she went past them; at the same time, cutting Qin Junlan\u2019s conversation short.A visit from her own elder sister on the second day of Qin Yirou\u2019s injury was supposed to be a joy.This however was not the reality.Qin Junlan\u2019s visit was only an excuse. Her true purpose was to ask for money back from Qin Yirou.Not too long ago, Qin Yirou borrowed some money from Qin Junlan as schools had just reopened and they were collecting tuition fees. Yun Yi\u2019s school fee was high as he was studying in one of the city\u2019s prominent high schools while Yun Jian was also still studying in town, the sum of their tuition fees was not a small amount.Qin Yirou was unable to make ends meet and could only borrow the sum from her elder sister, Qin Junlan, who was better off than her.Married well, Qin Junlan\u2019s husband was a small businessman, thus she lived comfortably.In spite of it, Qin Junlan was hesitant and reluctant to lend Qin Yirou the sum. Eventually, she had only grudgingly lent her money only afraid of being gossiped.Now that she heard the news of Qin Yirou being injured, Qin Junlan could no longer keep herself together. - It was not because she was worried about her younger sister\u2019s injury but she wondered how Qin Yirou would earn and clear her debt when her hands were injured.This was why Qin Junlan was here today with the whole family, to ask Qin Yirou for money in the name of visiting her.\u201cSis, look at my state now. I can\u2019t even eat on my own. Can I return you the money later? I\u2019ll go back to the factory once my injury heals and return you what I owe once I receive my pay!\u201d Qin Yirou pleaded Qin Junlan.Qin Junlan was further upset now; she had not been the happiest to lend her sister money in the beginning anyway.Actually, Qin Junlan\u2019s family did not really need the money. On the contrary, her family was one of the wealthiest in Xinjiang Town.Despite that, she was still unwilling to lend money for nothing, even if it were her biological sister. Moreover, who knew when her poverty-stricken sister could pay back what she borrowed!Hawk-eyed, Qin Junlan suddenly caught glimpse of the chicken soup Yun Jian was retrieving from the thermal lunchbox. Her initial discontent exploded at once.\u201cOh, Yirou, look at your condition now. You work so hard and got yourself injured yet your daughter went to buy chicken. How expensive a chicken is right now! How are you going to survive when she doesn\u2019t even know how to be frugal at this young age!\u201dIt was chicken! Qin Junlan\u2019s children barely had chicken throughout the year! In addition, Qin Yirou could not even repay her debt yet she was having chicken?Qin Junlan was even more dismayed once she thought about it.You can also listen onLiked it?

Yun Jian On FirePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationIn Qin Junlan\u2019s subconscious, her younger sister Qin Yirou, should do worse than her in every aspect of life since she was poorer.Seeing that Yun Jian had bought chicken to make soup for Qin Yirou when the latter still owed her money, how could she afford the poultry if she could not even repay her debt?Qin Junlan was even more disgruntled.\u201cI bought my mother the chicken for nourishment.\u201d Yun Jian took a glance at the haughty Qin Junlan, growing more annoyed at her supposed aunt.She crossly announced for them to leave. \u201cMy mom needs rest. Come another day if you have anything else to say.\u201dYun Jian could empathize that Qin Yirou must have felt heartbroken currently.She had an accident, her husband was nowhere to be found and they owed the loan sharks a huge amount of debt.Now her family had come to visit her, just to nag for the money she had borrowed, out of fear that she would not repay it.In reality, Qin Yirou was truly saddened by the truth. It was just that she did not show it.\u201cWhat minor injuries! Yirou\u2019s only hurt her hand, not like she can\u2019t use them forever. We\u2019re all from farming backgrounds. Who\u2019s never gotten hurt? Is there a need to make such a fuss?\u201dQin Junlan may have restrained herself when talking to Qin Yirou for the sisterhood they shared, but her attitude was completely different when she spoke to Yun Jian.Her words were piercing.She was calling Qin Yirou melodramatic in a turnaround way and scolding Yun Jian at the same time.Yun Jian could still refrain herself from doing anything to Qin Junlan just moments ago, as she was Qin Yirou\u2019s elder sister after all. Now, hearing what Qin Junlan said, Qin Yirou looked extremely disappointed as she tried to hold back her tears; her chagrin was evident.It was Qin Yirou\u2019s feelings that prevented Yun Jian from doing anything initially but coming to this stage, it would not be like Yun Jian to remain quiet any longer.A sharp-tongued person like Qin Junlan would have been killed more than a hundred times over if she had met the previous life of Yun Jian.\u201cSince my mom\u2019s injury isn\u2019t serious, would you like to try suffering from the same injury?\u201d Yun Jian side-eyed Qin Junlan with a sliver of killing intent burning in her gaze.\u201cI - You\u2026 Great! How dare you curse me? Sounding so proud huh! Yirou, oh, Yirou, look at your kid, is she educated? How could she even curse her own aunt! What can a kid like this achieve in the future!\u201d Qin Junlan\u2019s words were growing more disparaging as she did not mind a fall out for this trip.To Qin Junlan, her sister was destined to live her life in sorrow poverty when she married a gambling addict as her husband. What was more, Yun Jian\u2019s academic result was terrible.Previously, she had kept herself from discord with Qin Yirou because Yun Yi got into the city\u2019s prominent high school. She had thought that Yun Yi could help her children if he were to succeed in the future.Now? With Qin Yirou\u2019s injury, Yun Yi\u2019s tuition fee in the city\u2019s high school would be an issue.That was why Qin Junlan let her mouth run loose.Hearing what Qin Junlan said, Qin Yirou was even more disheartened.This was her biological sister! Yet venomous words were spilling from her lips. How could she not feel inconsolable!Opening her mouth, no words came out from Qin Yirou. Tears streamed from her cheeks like an opened tap.Yun Jian\u2019s hesitation vanished then. Her sharp gaze shifted to the culprit, Qin Junlan, and her leg went to a wooden stool that was the nearest to her. With a thrust, the solid wooden stool was utterly shattered.\u201cBang!\u201dThe loud noise caused Qin Junlan and the family to panic and take a few steps back.They had never seen someone who could smash a stool into pieces, the shock that ran through them manifested as disbelieving gazes towards Yun Jian.The girl who had just displayed an unbelievable feat stood where she was staring at them. \u201cGet out!

Why does the Qin family have an insolent brat like this! She wants to beat up and kill her own aunt, what can a girl like this grow up to become\u2026\u201dA round of bashing later, the group of people fled.After that, the ward finally regained its peace. However, Qin Yirou\u2019s mind remained perturbed.Yun Jian did not know how to console her and could only walk over to place her hand on Qin Yirou\u2019s back to give her a pat.\u201cMom, don\u2019t be upset. We\u2019re living for ourselves. We don\u2019t have to be sad because of others.\u201d Yun Jian comforted Qin Yirou.\u2026Today was a weekend where Yun Jian was supposed to return to school for an evening self-study session but she had applied for a leave.She knew that a tough fight was waiting for her back in school.She was the culprit of Lin Mengyu\u2019s hospital admittance and Lin Mengyu\u2019s father was Xinjiang Town Junior High School\u2019s principal. The incident would never end so easily but Yun Jian was not afraid.When Qin Junlan came tonight, it made Yun Jian further realize that her family was basically poverty-stricken.Living her life at the top of the world in her previous life, what Yun Jian lacked the least was money. In the past, a mission of hers began from at least one hundred million US dollars.Rebirthed to an ordinary junior high school girl\u2019s body now, it allowed her to experience the life of a commoner as well as the petty issues that came with it.That said at least she did not have to live life on the edge now.It was Monday the next morning. Yun Jian applied for a leave from her homeroom teacher and took the public transport to Longmen City center after sending Qin Yirou breakfast.She took the trip to the city in advance as her family was in urgent need of money. The dunning loan sharks and yesterday\u2019s Qin Junlan were both evidence of the fact.Her purpose in going to the city was to make money in the fastest way possible.Using the allowance Yun Yi had forced her to take before he went back to school, Yun Jian took a ride to the busiest part of Longmen City.As the sun rose early in the morning, Yun Jian who was wearing casual attire and a high ponytail marched to the liveliest part of Longmen City, the bustling Huaren Street.Huaren Street was a street in the city that could cater to everyone\u2019s needs.Here, you could find anything you wish to buy or need to use.Yun Jian\u2019s destination, surprisingly, was the only internet caf\u00e9 with the newest furnishing in Huaren Street.The internet caf\u00e9s of this era charged around four Chinese Yuan for an hour. Yun Jian paid for it and sat herself down before the computer.As mentioned, she was not only the ace of secret agents, she was an expert hacker.For now, she could yet figure out how to earn fast enough, so she planned to steal money by hacking into systems.In spite of it, she was not thinking to simply hack a company, although she was confident that she could thoroughly collapse the finance department of any corporation in the shortest of time.This was illegal in Country Z. It was not in Yun Jian\u2019s mind to be the first one to break the law.The finance department that she planned to heist from was not anyone else but an organization that she had founded when she was still the Slaying God during her previous life as a secret agent.You can also listen onLiked it?

Thirty SecondsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationShe had founded the organization indiscretion. It was legitimate, being one of the top ten multinational corporations globally. Its total asset was immeasurable by currencies.This corporation had nothing to do with Gu Sha Mercenaries.One was within the law while another was under the counter, after all.The organization was handled by her other subordinate, a bewitching woman with the moniker Alluring Demon.Now that Yun Jian was in a different body, everything that could represent her identity in the past was no longer in her grasp.With her current appearance, it would be complicated if she asked for money from her own company.It was extremely inconvenient that she was in Country Z right now, too, so the fastest way was to hack into her corporation\u2019s system and heist what she wanted directly.Yun Jian\u2019s fingers rapped at the keyboard freely, working through the familiar code at an incredible speed.Her eyes were trained on the monitor. After making sure of the IP address and going through a series of steps, she picked \u201cYes\u201d from the \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo\u201d option that sprang from the dialog box before hitting the spacebar.The entire process took only tens of seconds.It was when a clear line of English text popped up on the screen that Yun Jian lightly pressed her lips together.Hacked and heisted.As for Yun Jian\u2019s rapid typing just now, it attracted the attention of some of the youngsters gaming in the internet caf\u00e9.\u2026Simultaneously, an incredibly enchanting woman was seated before the desk of a multinational corporation\u2019s executive office leisurely spinning a black fountain pen.This person was Yun Jian\u2019s subordinate, the one with the moniker Alluring Demon.\u201cRing, ring\u2026\u201d The telephone beside her rang out of the blue.Alluring Demon picked up to hear a panicky female voice say, \u201cChief, not good. The high-level firewall of the tech department is hacked. The hacker used only thirty seconds to attack the system and stole one hundred million US dollars from our finance department!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d The black fountain pen in Alluring Demon\u2019s hand fell to the floor with a clack as she stood up briskly and questioned in disbelief, \u201cHow is this possible?\u201dTheir company was one of the top ten multinational corporations in the nation and their technical department housed elites from all over the world.Forget about hacking their company, cracking down the company\u2019s firewall system would already be a challenge to even the most notable people on the international hacker ranking.To be able to hack them in a brief thirty seconds, she knew only one person who could do it.\u2026In the hazy internet caf\u00e9 of Country Z\u2019s Longmen City, Yun Jian had completely disrupted the reverse tracking of her company\u2019s technical department.A hundred million US dollars was smoothly transferred into Qin Yirou\u2019s bankcard.In order not to let Qin Yirou discover the massive amount of wealth, Yun Jian had specifically stolen the bank card from their house today.Nonetheless, she must be the only person to steal from herself in all of history.Yun Jian shut down the computer and just as she stood up, a surprised greeting came from behind her. \u201cYou\u2019re Yun Jian, right? Why are you here?\u201dBaffled, Yun Jian wondered briefly how she could bump into someone who knew her when she was already in Longmen City.Turning around, she saw a teenager about fifteen or sixteen years old looking at her in surprise.\u201cYou\u2019re?\u201d Yun Jian could not recall the person.The young boy chuckled and scratched the back of his head. \u201cOh, I forgot. You don\u2019t know me. I\u2019m Li Xiangyi. We met the other day. At Xinjiang Town\u2019s park. I was with Yuan Yingjun. I remember clearly that you killed a cobra with your bare hands!

Her expression and moves were awesome! - Just like the martial arts experts in the movies!This was why Li Xiangyi treated Yun Jian like an idol now when he saw her.\u201cHeh heh, Yun Jian, my mate, I\u2019ve been admiring you since the day I watched you kill that cobra. I didn\u2019t expect to bump into you today. Do you think I have the honor to buy you a meal?\u201d Li Xiangyi was always happy-go-lucky, not changing himself even when he was talking to Yun Jian.Actually, Li Xiangyi was just an acquaintance to Yuan Yingjun and clique. It was due to his decent family background that no one dared to offend him, at least in Xinjiang Town.Otherwise, he would not be gaming here in the city\u2019s internet caf\u00e9 under the risk of being punished by the school.Rich kids like Li Xiangyi, usually, would also scoff at poorer kids like Yun Jian. However, Li Xiangyi did not.This surprised Yun Jian and added more points to her impression of Li Xiangyi.Smiling faintly, Yun Jian shook her head. \u201cNah, I\u2019m going back to town right away.\u201dShe had to send lunch to Qin Yirou.\u201cOh, okay then.\u201d Li Xiangyi could only nod in slight disappointment.\u201cLi Xiangyi, get your ass back. You\u2019re the only one missing and the game\u2019s starting. How long do you need for the toilet? Quick!\u201d Li Xiangyi\u2019s friend called out to him from the other end.Li Xiangyi scratched his head and told Yun Jian apologetically, \u201cMy friend\u2019s asking for me. I\u2019ll head over now. See you next time!\u201d He then ran over.Yun Jian thought that the young man was quite friendly, the complete opposite from Yuan Yingjun and his clique.Not thinking about the issue further, she stepped out of the internet caf\u00e9 and walked over to the bank with the bankcard in her hand.She had transferred a hundred million US dollars to the bankcard, approximately six hundred million Chinese Yuan in exchange.Yun Jian cashed out three thick stacks, thirty thousand Chinese Yuan in total, and kept them in a black bag before storing it into her backpack.Cashing out too much would attract unwanted attention, after all.She then took the public transport back to Xinjiang Town.It was not lunch time yet and she was in no hurry to get home. Yun Jian went straight to Zhang Zhifan\u2019s hideout.It was only reasonable that Yun Jian had thoroughly gotten hold of the group\u2019s information, thus being able to head directly to their lair.Zhang Zhifan and the gang had made a considerable amount of money throughout these years being loan sharks. Their den was located in the best area of Xinjiang Town.Zhang Zhifan and a few men of his gang were playing mahjong when Yun Jian went straight to their house.\u201cPair, I win!\u201d Zhang Zhifan had just slapped the final mahjong tile in his hand before he caught sight of the smiling girl who stood near them.Shocked, he sprang up from his seat.\u201cBro Fan, what\u2019s up?\u201d asked the rest as they followed Zhang Zhifan\u2019s gaze to Yun Jian.Yun Jian walked over leisurely and took out a thick bundle of cash from her bag. She slammed the bundle on the table.\u201cTen thousand to repay my father\u2019s debt. Is it enough?\u201d Yun Jian asked with a raise of an eyebrow.You can also listen onLiked it?

How could they have so much money?In other words, the men wondered where she got the cash from.\u201cEnough! Of course, it\u2019s enough!\u201d There was no doubt that Zhang Zhifan was the leader as he was the first to react and pocketed the cash, nodding as he replied with a laugh.There was even a surplus of five thousand Chinese Yuan!Yun Jian smiled in return but she was not finished yet.Extending her arm, she took out another bundle of cash from her bag and slapped it on the table again.Zhang Zhifan was close to being stupefied seeing the repetition when he had just carefully kept the ten thousand Chinese Yuan.What was she planning to do?\u201cThe ten thousand just now is to clear the debt. This ten thousand is our meeting gift.\u201d Yun Jian smirked and scanned Zhang Zhifan and gang before saying, \u201cWant to work with me? I want to set up a shop in Longmen City, not sure of the particulars yet, but I\u2019ll fund the capital. You only have to handle the business for me. Of course, the premise is that all of you are not allowed to be loan sharks anymore.\u201dShe planned to set up a business in Longmen City. The city was along the coast and was one of the rapidly developing cities in the country. The convenience of commerce and trade added to its immense potential for development.Naturally, Yun Jian did not want to miss a money-making opportunity like this.As for the reason she came to Zhang Zhifan and gang for handling the business, it was not without consideration.Although they had provoked her, they did not harm her family.It was impossible to recruit softies who looked gentlemanly but were mere followers when Yun Jian was starting up a business.It was notable that Zhang Zhifan knew when to advance and retreat.When he led his gang to dun for the debt at Yun Jian\u2019s that day, he was sharp enough to flee knowing it was time to retreat when his man was put through affliction.He did not advance recklessly for all or nothing.This characteristic alone matched a businessman\u2019s behavior perfectly.One should advance when he could without backing down, but if the opponent is too strong then one must be able to bend and yield when he must.\u201cBusiness? A shop? And you look for us? No, no, we\u2019re a bunch of loansharking gangsters. How are we supposed to know how to maintain a business?\u201d Zhang Zhifan looked at Yun Jian with his jaw dropped.It was not just him. His group of men was also staring at Yun Jian in bafflement.\u201cI know what you don\u2019t know. I can teach you guys. Who knows how to trade since birth? Who can walk and run once they\u2019re born? Instead of living the life of a bandit, you might as well make something out of yourselves with me. You barge into people\u2019s houses to dun for debts, what about working with me?\u201dYun Jian was still smiling as she looked at the gang.In spite of it, her words surprised the gang.The reality was, everyone here was not loansharking out of their own will; they had no way out other than resorting to this job because they needed money to survive.Just like what Yun Jian said, what about trying? They dared to loanshark and breaking into houses for debts with the risk of being sent to the prison anyway.\u201cAlright! Since you present such an expensive meeting gift to us, we\u2019ll try it out with you!\u201d Zhang Zhifan was silent for a few seconds with his fists clenched before he suddenly chuckled and began easily.They need not contribute capital. They only had to be there. There was nothing to lose!Furthermore, the girl in front of them was surely significant when she could produce twenty thousand Chinese Yuan in just a few days.With Zhang Zhifan being the head, his men quickly agreed as well.Yun Jian grinned.Her first bang after her rebirth was going to be from Longmen City.You can also listen onLiked it?

After this, she needed another trip to Longmen City and would have to stay there for a while to complete the tasks.The next day, Tuesday morning, Yun Jian woke up bright and early for a morning run. She then stuffed a few books into her schoolbag and headed for school.She had only taken a day of leave, so she had to attend class today.Right as she got to the classroom door, she saw Lu Feiyan waving at her from her seat.Since it was not the time for their self-study session yet, Lu Feiyan left her seat to skip over to Yun Jian instead and asked, \u201cXiao Jian, why were you absent yesterday? The teacher said you were sick. Are you alright now? Why don\u2019t you rest a bit more if you don\u2019t feel well?\u201dLu Feiyan\u2019s concerned tone surprised Yun Jian as she recalled that her excuse to the homeroom teacher yesterday was that she was not feeling well. She did not expect that it would make Lu Feiyan worried for the whole day.Feeling a gush of warmth, Yun Jian replied, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d\u201cYour health is your most precious asset. You must take better care of yourself!\u201d Lu Feiyan obviously had no idea of what happened in Yun Jian\u2019s family as she told Yun Jian animatedly.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian nodded and entered the classroom with her friend.Once she did, the noisy classroom suddenly quieted down.\u201cLook! It\u2019s Yun Jian who\u2019s back. I thought that she wouldn\u2019t dare come back to school anymore. She\u2019s the one who got the principal\u2019s daughter in hospital last Friday! One of Lin Mengyu\u2019s rib bones was even broken!\u201d A mischievous boy in the class spoke as if he was the witness to the case.There were classmates who chorused him immediately.\u201cWow, really? Yun Jian became so strong out of a sudden? Tsch, tsch, not bad, not bad. She dared hit the principal\u2019s daughter huh!\u201d\u201cYun Jian\u2019s probably doomed!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s her own fault. Who can she blame?\u201d\u2026No one knew about the incident on Friday but as time passed, rumors spread as someone received the news.They did not even care to avoid being heard by Yun Jian.Yun Jian did not mind listening to them. It was Lu Feiyan who instead got furious.\u201cXiao Jian, don\u2019t be angered. They have a loose mouth and know only to spew nonsense!\u201d Lu Feiyan comforted Yun Jian before stomping to the group of gossipers and spoke louder. \u201cStop saying nonsense! It\u2019s Lin Mengyu who bullied Xiao Jian first! I can be witness!\u201d\u201cHah! Witness? For what? Is there a point? Lin Mengyu\u2019s the principal\u2019s precious daughter!\u201d An impish boy who crossed his legs high on the chair looked at Lu Feiyan, chuckling as he replied to her.Lu Feiyan had never been the tough type. To be jabbed like that she was incredibly frustrated but had no way of retorting.\u201cDo you have nothing to do?\u201d Yun Jian who had kept quiet said suddenly when the group of students pointed fingers at her, as their words grew progressively ugly.\u201cAh?\u201d The crowd was stunned for a moment.\u201cBored? Lonely? Feeling empty?\u201d Yun Jian spat and smirked. \u201cIf you are, go on chatting.

Not only was she the daughter of their principal, but she was also the leader of the ninth grade mean girls. Her feistiness required no additional mention.What about Yun Jian? Yun Jian used to be a wimp who stayed invisible in class and dared not make a sound or rebuttal when she was scolded. A fight? How could she?However, now she had put Lin Mengyu into hospital and shoved her classmates\u2019 words back into their mouth instead of running out with a sob as she used to when they told tales about her.Even her aura had changed!\u201cYun Jian, drop your pretense if you\u2019re that good. We\u2019re just making a few comments about you, not like it\u2019ll do anything. Do you have to be so calculative? What now? You can\u2019t bear hearing what you\u2019ve done being spoken about?\u201dAmong the crowd, a girl as tall as 1.75m stood up and looked snobbishly at Yun Jian with a tipped chin as she talked righteously.The girl was Mu Xiang. She was average looking but was taller than most boys. Despite being in charge of class sports, she was not really popular among the boys. At the same time, she was extremely jealous of Yun Jian.Yun Jian was not the tallest but she had a delicate face, the one that you would be fond of at a glance. Her features were pretty too, her complexion clear with rosy cheeks.It was a stark contrast against Mu Xiang.This was the reason Mu Xiang was always plotting ways to bully Yun Jian in the original memory of the latter\u2019s body.With what happened today, Mu Xiang thought that she had caught Yun Jian\u2019s wrongdoing, thus standing up to taunt her.\u201cMu Xiang, be reasonable! You - you - Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know that you\u2019re jealous of Xiao Jian being prettier than you. That\u2019s why you keep targeting her. Have some face!\u201d Lu Feiyan lost her cool before Yun Jian and argued for her again.Mu Xiang whose true demeanor was exposed widened her eyes suddenly. She glared at both Lu Feiyan and Yun Jian, unable to accept the fact that she was uglier than Yun Jian.\u201cScram! Who\u2019s jealous of her? Lu Feiyan, stop accusing me! Heh, what are you girls so proud of? The teacher will probably be looking for you later. Haha, I\u2019ll just wait for the two of you to cry later since you dared hit the principal\u2019s daughter! Hmph!\u201d Mu Xiang cussed.Their classmates watched the fierce argument but no one stepped out to stop them. Most of them were just watching the drama.Mu Xiang was known to be trouble in class. It was said that she had learned Taekwondo and was harder to beat than Lin Mengyu who was often involved in fights too!Were they going to fight now?The students would very much like to find out who was the better fighter between Mu Xiang and Yun Jian who had gotten Lin Mengyu into hospital.\u201cDo you know why I beat Lin Mengyu up?\u201d Yun Jian crossed her arms in front of herself and scanned the crowd before locking her gaze on Mu Xiang.The students were stunned.Mu Xiang and Lu Feiyan were flushed from their heated debate but they, too, were caught off guard by Yun Jian\u2019s words.Yun Jian was then heard continuing her speech at Mu Xiang.\u201cBecause she\u2019s just like you, looking very much in need of a beating.\u201dThe entire class was dead silent.

Meeting Once AgainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationMu Xiang was stunned before she caught on swiftly that Yun Jian was throwing insults at her in a roundabout way. Infuriated, she instantly pointed at Yun Jian and lashed out. \u201cYou\u2019re the one in need of a beating! Yun Jian, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re great just because you\u2019ve beaten Lin Mengyu up. Let me tell you, if it weren\u2019t for the punishment for fighting in school, I\u2019ll whack you down on the floor and let you stay there!\u201dAs she spoke, she rolled up her sleeves for intimidation.She was trained in Taekwondo, after all!Fighting had always been an ability that Mu Xiang was proud of.She had started learning Taekwondo since elementary school and was already blue-red belt now!It was not a high belt level but Mu Xiang was very confident in tackling Yun Jian.Yun Jian smirked, suddenly feeling that Mu Xiang\u2019s temper was just like a baby. She turned around to ignore Mu Xiang and signaled at Lu Feiyan before returning to her seat.If they continued arguing, it would be endless. She did not have the time.\u201cAfraid huh, Yun Jian? Hmph, this isn\u2019t settled, I tell you! Just you wait!\u201d Mu Xiang threatened Yun Jian angrily when she saw that the latter left without responding to her.\u201cI\u2019m waiting.\u201d Yun Jian was already back to her seat. Turning around, she wore a sly smile.Those who wanted her dead were as significant as assassins and secret agents on international ranking, to as petty as politicians but since when had she been afraid?What was more, this was just a threat from a junior high school girl.\u2026The morning slipped away in a chorus of textbook recital. Teachers gave their lessons one after another but none had come for Yun Jian about the incident of last Friday.Yun Jian herself felt rather puzzled.Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan sat on a grass patch during the free time in PE in the afternoon and watched their classmates play in the field.\u201cXiao Jian, we\u2019re in ninth grade now and the senior high school entrance exam is approaching. Have you thought about the senior high of your choice?\u201d Lu Feiyan asked while she stirred the soil on the grass patch holding a branch.\u201cLongmen City\u2019s top senior high school,\u201d Yun Jian replied casually.Longmen City\u2019s top senior high school was the most prominent high school in the city. It was also the school her elder brother Yun Yi attended.Yun Jian wanted to study there too.Once Lu Feiyan heard her, however, her eyes bulged. \u201cThat\u2019s the best senior high school in our city. The admission score is incredibly high! There\u2019s probably only one or two students from our school who could qualify. Xiao Jian\u2026\u201dIt was not that Lu Feiyan looked down at Yun Jian. Yun Jian\u2019s result was honestly not the best in the past.It was difficult for her to even score within the top hundred in their year.Only students who scored the first few places in their year would qualify for a chance to apply for the prominent high school.\u201cI\u2019ll get it. We still have a year to study, haven\u2019t we?\u201d Yun Jian blinked and smiled.She had already fully comprehended the syllabus of junior high school in her past life. There was nothing to worry about.\u201cHey, Yun Jian! You guys have PE for this period too?\u201d A familiar voice of a boy cut in when Yun Jian and Lu Feiyan chatted.Yun Jian turned to see Li Xiangyi whom she met yesterday morning standing before them. He held a basketball in his hands too, obviously here to play the game.She also saw a group of boys behind Li Xiangyi, the same group she saw gaming with him in the internet caf\u00e9 yesterday.You can also listen onLiked it?

They were also having PE in this period.\u201cWow, you guys know each other, Xiao Jian?\u201d Lu Feiyan shifted her gaze between Yun Jian and Li Xiangyi in surprise.\u201cWe met twice.\u201d Yun Jian explained.Lu Feiyan nodded with an \u201cOh\u201d.Li Xiangyi scratched his head out of habit and raised the basketball in his hands quite shyly. \u201cHey, um, the weather\u2019s pretty good today, so the few of us are out to practice basketball. Yun Jian, do you know how to play?\u201dActually, it was a stupid question to ask a girl if she knew how to play basketball.A boy who stood beside Li Xiangyi laughed clapping the latter\u2019s shoulder and spoke first, \u201cSay, Li Xiangyi, isn\u2019t it a waste to ask? The most a girl could do playing basketball is tapping the ball twice and trying to shoot. They won\u2019t be able to play in a match! Are you actually thinking to ask this girl to join our team?\u201dChuckling awkwardly, Li Xiangyi had still kept his gaze at Yun Jian.They were going to have a basketball match a few days later. It was a friendly match between them and another school.A player in their team got injured and was certainly unable to participate in that match, thus they wanted to recruit another player despite how unrealistic it seemed. After all, people who really knew how to play basketball were scarce.It did not make sense for them to play against another school with a missing player as well. It was not fair to them.When Li Xiangyi saw Yun Jian today, the scene of her killing the cobra replayed in his mind once more.If Yun Jian knew how to play basketball and could join their team, the chance of their team winning would be higher with her amazing agility!Of course, Li Xiangyi was not sure if the girl knew how to play the sport.Unexpectedly, Yun Jian smiled a little and nodded whilst the teenagers watched. \u201cI know a bit.\u201dShe knew a little about basketball; shooting at the basket was just like throwing various flying knives and daggers during assassinations. Relatively speaking, basketball was bigger in size and simpler.\u201cHuh, Xiao Jian, you know how to play? Why didn\u2019t I know!\u201d Lu Feiyan exclaimed in shock.\u201cI learn from my brother, so I know some.\u201d Yun Jian lied effortlessly.\u201cThat can\u2019t do it!\u201d The boy beside Li Xiangyi commented again and paused to talk to Li Xiangyi with a slightly stricter tone, \u201cIt\u2019s not realistic at all to let a girl join our basketball team and compete against boys from other schools. Can she shoot? She\u2019ll burden our team instead. Li Xiangyi, I\u2019m the first to disagree with this. Don\u2019t even think about it!\u201dThe boy who disagreed was one of Li Xiangyi\u2019s good friends, Wu Kui, who was also a member of the Xinjiang Town Junior High School basketball team.Yun Jian finally made out that Li Xiangyi was proposing for her to join the basketball team for a competition from his conversation with Wu Kui.In spite of it, she could also deduce from Wu Kui\u2019s tone that everyone else other than Li Xiangyi seemed to be brushing off her statement of being able to play basketball.Forget basketball, she could kill a person with a needle by striking their fatal point even from a far distance. In comparison, basketball was nothing.\u201cYou want me to join your basketball team?\u201d Yun Jian turned to ask Li Xiangyi.The boy was stunned for a brief second before nodding dumbly. \u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cOkay, I will.\u201d Yun Jian smiled in a friendly manner.\u201cHold up, we haven\u2019t agreed to it! She\u2019s not qualified to take part in the match with us!\u201d Wu Kui rejected her strongly seeing that Yun Jian did not take the hint and took the initiative instead.Who said that they wanted her in the team? Did they all agree?Right after Wu Kui spoke, Yun Jian stood up from the ground and hooked the basketball in Li Xiangyi\u2019s hands to herself.What happened next astonished everyone on the spot.Yun Jian held the ball with both hands and tossed it.With a beautiful arc, the basketball flew toward the basket that was thirty to forty meters away.Then, it went in!The basketball stand was so far away it was basically the length of a basketball court, yet Yun Jian had actually made a shot from where she was.Everyone who watched was dumbstruck.Gosh!

She stared at Yun Jian in an earth-shattering shock.Wu Kui who spoke brashly just before felt like he was slapped hard on the face; despite being the one considering the betterment of the team.Having just witnessed this scene, no one could speak a word. There was no doubt that an ordinary person could shoot a basket from thirty to forty meters away.\u201cSorry, my tone was too harsh just now.\u201d Wu Kui was cooperative as he apologized to Yun Jian with an embarrassed chortle.He then sincerely continued. \u201cI\u2019ll formally introduce myself. I\u2019m the school basketball team\u2019s vice captain, Wu Kui. The captain isn\u2019t around but I can represent the team in inviting you to join us. Would you honor us the pleasure?\u201dWu Kui\u2019s attitude took a full turn at once.Everyone saw Yun Jian\u2019s performance just now. The members who had vehemently opposed Li Xiangyi\u2019s invitation to Yun Jian had a change of mind now.Yun Jian met his gaze and beamed. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll join.\u201dShe had missed living like an ordinary person in her previous life; now that she was reborn into school life, she wanted to savor the experience.The basketball team members were relieved when Yun Jian agreed to be a part of the team.They did not expect the girl who Li Xiangyi knew was so capable.Coming up to this a greeting, the worrisome issue of being unable to participate in the basketball competition as they were short one player was now solved.Wu Kui\u2019s impression of Yun Jian switched as well. He spoke to the girl so rudely just now but she had been easygoing instead of purposely making the situation hard for him.Such a girl was different from the rest.\u201cWelcome!\u201d Wu Kui expressed his sincere pleasure on behalf of the basketball team.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian smiled with her eyes turning into crescents.\u2026Yun Jian did not expect to have joined a basketball team in a mere period of PE.Lu Feiyan looked more delighted than Yun Jian, chattering on and on beside her for the whole day with excitement that was hard to contain.\u201cXiao Jian, you\u2019re awesome! You\u2019ll be representing our school for a basketball tournament! If the match is on a holiday, I\u2019ll surely be there to cheer you on!\u201dLu Feiyan had repeated similar lines to Yun Jian for the entire afternoon. While the latter thought it was noisy and annoying, she was also glad.She had friends now. She was no longer the organization\u2019s killing machine.It was just a pity that her younger brother was not ever coming back when she got to live a peaceful life like this.By 8pm, the evening self-study session ended and school was dismissed on time.Yun Jian picked up her schoolbag and took the opposite direction from where Lu Feiyan was headed.She was going to Qin Yirou who was in the hospital, located opposite from where Lu Feiyan and her house were.After bidding goodbye with Lu Feiyan, Yun Jian walked in the dark alley alone.The alley was the shortest route to the hospital but it was also the darkest. Usually, no one dared to walk the alleyway alone.Yun Jian\u2019s steady steps were quite lighthearted, however.When she came to the intersection of the alley, Yun Jian stopped out of the blue and leaned her back against the wall of a hut. She chuckled towards the darker end of where she came from. \u201cCome on out. How long do you plan to follow me?\u201dSomeone was tailing after her and that someone\u2019s skill was honestly rather lousy.At the very least, she had realized it from the start.This level of stalking was basically telling Yun Jian out loud that \u201cI\u2019m following you.

Yun Jian, you didn\u2019t expect it was me, huh? How dare you talk about me like that this morning. If I don\u2019t teach you a lesson today, I\u2019ll remove my family name Mu!\u201d Mu Xiang\u2019s hands were on her hips; the more she looked at Yun Jian\u2019s pretty face, the more jealous she grew.Turning her head, Mu Xiang spoke to the man beside her who was in his thirties. She was close to pressing herself on the man. \u201cBrother Hu, it\u2019s her. She bullied me in the morning. You must take revenge for your Baby Xiang.\u201dGoosebumps racked through Yun Jian when she heard Mu Xiang calling herself \u201cBaby Xiang\u201d. Crossing her arms in front of her chest, she would like to see what the crooks planned to do to her.The man who was addressed as Brother Hu wrapped his arm around Mu Xiang, his plump hand slapping the girl\u2019s buttocks twice, as he grinned maliciously. \u201cWe\u2019ll listen to you, okay? We\u2019ll do what you want today!\u201dWith Brother Hu\u2019s promise, Mu Xiang looked at Yun Jian even more smugly raising her chin.Brother Hu was from Xinjiang Town\u2019s black market and was an influential big gun in the town. He was one of the members of the Longmen Gang in Longmen City\u2019s black market too!After involving herself with Brother Hu, Mu Xiang felt that her vibe was now completely different from her past self.\u201cReally?\u201d Mu Xiang\u2019s rhetorical question was sweet and silky in tone. After that, her gaze at Yun Jian switched as she spoke brutally, \u201cThen I want to destroy her innocence. She\u2019s been as stuck-up as usual, seducing the boys in our school every day with her looks. Brother Hu, let your bros take turns with her. I\u2019d love to see how vain she can still be in the future!\u201dMu Xiang was more ruthless than Lin Mengyu. The corner of Yun Jian\u2019s lips tugged upward icily.If she were an ordinary girl today, Mu Xiang\u2019s ulterior motive would have succeeded.Ruining her innocence. - If an ordinary junior high schoolgirl\u2019s innocence were ruined, she would probably live her entire life in trauma in addition to facing discrimination from people around her. Her whole life would basically be doomed.It was too bad that Yun Jian was no average girl.Mu Xiang\u2019s little plan would have to go down the drain.\u201cHeh heh, it\u2019s a good idea.\u201d Brother Hu chuckled and pushed Mu Xiang aside to make his way toward Yun Jian. \u201cThen let me be the first!\u201dHow could he let his lackeys go first when he had an advantage like this? Furthermore, the girl was much prettier than Mu Xiang. Maybe she was still a virgin!Being pushed away without a care, Mu Xiang\u2019s hatred for Yun Jian escalated. Nonetheless, once she thought about how wretched Yun Jian would be later, joy bubbled within her.Yun Jian\u2019s gaze turned colder as she watched Brother Hu\u2019s plump self approach her. As she planned to beat the thugs down, her sharp senses suddenly caught an oddity.A soft \u201ctss\u201d was heard.It was immensely soft. If she had not been a secret agent, a sound like this would go unnoticed by normal people.In spite of it, this was a sound Yun Jian was very familiar with. - It was the sound of a pistol silencer!There were other people around them!Yun Jian abruptly sprinted to the left of the alley\u2019s intersection where the sound of the silencer pistol came from.Brother Hu and the gang were going to encircle Yun Jian when the girl ran, causing them to think that Yun Jian was escaping.\u201cShe\u2019s running away. Chase after her! Quick!\u201d Mu Xiang shouted, pointing at the direction Yun Jian had run.The gang foolishly obeyed and pursued Yun Jian.You can also listen onLiked it?

In a blink of an eye, she had set herself a long distance away from the men.Following the direction of the silencer pistol\u2019s \u201ctss\u201d, Yun Jian arrived at the other end of the alley. She hid at a corner and peeked.What greeted her sight was a bloodied middle-aged man who lay on the floor, apparently dead.Yun Jian was certain that the gunshot she heard just now was the one that killed the man.Moving her gaze forward, she saw a woman in a vermillion robe standing in front.The woman was covered in wounds, her state not much better than the dead man, but she guarded the item in her embrace resolutely.Before her were three men in their twenties. The person in the middle was probably only nineteen or twenty years old but he was the most notifiable one among the trio.The boy was fair with supple skin but his face was structured in cold lines and angles with a tall nose that looked perfectly sculpted.Yun Jian could discern that the other two men beside him took him as their center.Describing the man as gorgeous was no exaggeration. - This was the first time Yun Jian saw a man who exuded both masculine and feminine beauty, causing her to make a double take subconsciously.\u201cEnchantress, hand over what\u2019s in your grip. Otherwise, we\u2019ll kill you now!\u201d The man standing beside the gorgeous boy told the woman in the vermillion robe after receiving his permission.Yun Jian raised her brow when she heard how the woman was addressed.She was not unfamiliar with the name Enchantress. Enchantress was ranked the tenth in the ranking of secret agents. It was said that this person loved wearing bright red gowns all year long and was seductive and unchaste.Yun Jian did not expect to meet her in an unassuming place like Xinjiang Town.Before she could think further into it, the woman with the moniker Enchantress laughed looking at the three males. \u201cDream on! I\u2019ve toiled for this little thing. It\u2019s impossible that I give it to you just like this!\u201d\u201cYoung master, this damned woman doesn\u2019t know better. Why don\u2019t we kill her right now and snatch what we want!\u201d The other man beside the boy who looked worse in temper asked, licking his lips.Of course, the right to decide was still in the hands of the gorgeous boy they called \u201cyoung master\u201d.The gorgeous boy was not older than both the other men but his gaze was dim and deep that Yun Jian could not guess his current thoughts.\u201cKill her.\u201d The gorgeous boy landed his order; his low tone tinged with cruel belligerence.Not long after the words were spoken, noises were heard. The three men including Enchantress who had been staying on guard felt something in the air as they looked toward the wall Yun Jian was hiding behind in unisonYun Jian\u2019s capability to conceal herself was adequate to be unnoticed by the group but those on the spot had indeed cast their gaze in her direction.It was not that she had exposed herself but\u2026\u201cChase after her! Faster! Yun Jian that bitch won\u2019t be far!\u201d Mu Xiang\u2019s shrill voice was heard from a distance away behind her. Yun Jian\u2019s face darkened.Once the piercing noise was heard, Yun Jian gave up hiding and stepped away from the wall, surprising the group who was there earlier.Since when was a person hiding there that they did not realize her?The gorgeous boy squinted, his sharp gaze coincidentally meeting Yun Jian\u2019s.\u201cYun Jian, where are you running to\u2026 Ah! Ah! De - dea - de! A dead man!\u201d It was then that Mu Xiang, Brother Hu, and the gang arrived at the scene.As they walked over cursing, they suddenly saw the middle-aged man who was already dead on the floor.

Shaking, she kept crying aloud, \u201cSomeone - someone\u2019s dead\u2026\u201dShe was only an ordinary student, never having seen a dead person. Furthermore, this dead man was in a terrible state lying in a pool of blood\u2026For a moment, Mu Xiang had completely forgotten that she was here to teach Yun Jian a lesson, for she was now filled with endless terror and panic.\u201cToo noisy,\u201d the gorgeous man spat two words with a slight frown.His dazzling eyes raked past Mu Xiang impatiently to stop on Yun Jian with a smirk.Was this girl not afraid? Interesting!While the gorgeous boy studied her, Yun Jian scrutinized him as well but her gaze was mostly on Enchantress.In her past life, she was the Slaying God who ranked first among the secret agents, whilst the Enchantress was ranked tenth. Anyone among the top ten secret agents was certainly no easy target.In spite of it, this man could pursue the Enchantress and forced the usually sly character to an impasse. It was apparent that he, too, was a tough character!As the gorgeous boy scanned Yun Jian, he raised his arm slowly gripping the newest Browning silencer pistol in his fair, long fingers. His eyes were on Yun Jian but the pistol was aimed at the Enchantress.\u201cDie, if you refuse to hand it over.\u201d The statement was simple. The gorgeous man spoke before pressing his lips together, his beautiful features were inexplicably domineering.Yun Jian narrowed her eyes as she stared at the Enchantress, taking in how her expression shifted when she saw that the pistol was precisely pointed at her.The Enchantress paled immediately.She did not know where this boy of nineteen or twenty years old came from. She only knew that this person was from the world\u2019s strongest armaments family, Depot Leng. There was no other way of knowing his details.The Depot Leng was an armaments organization. Its standard of weaponry was higher than a developed nation and even surpasses secret agents or assassination organizations. Nevertheless, Depot Leng had always kept to itself without drawing unnecessary attention.The fact was that the gorgeous boy was from Depot Leng; he was also Depot Leng\u2019s young master, the future heir to it.His name was Si Yi.It was also within reason that the Enchantress paled when she saw Si Yi lifting the pistol.The middle-aged man who was lying dead in a pool of his own blood was the secret agent who ranked sixth internationally, Deft.Tiger. This person was incredibly capable and courageous, famed for his speed and agility.However, a person like this was killed by Si Yi, by one singular shot!If Deft.Tiger who was known for his speed and agility could not fight Si Yi, could the Enchantress survive?\u201cWait! I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d The Enchantress surrendered. There was no way she would swap her life for the completion of her mission; biting her lips, she tossed what she had been guarding in her hands to Si Yi.Si Yi\u2019s long and lean hand caught what the Enchantress threw. His dark eyes then studied the object in his grasp attentively.While his attention was occupied, the Enchantress held her wound and fled the place speedily.Yun Jian\u2019s eyes widened at once.\u201cThe sandalwood box\u2026\u201d She uttered softly.What the Enchantress had been guarding so adamantly just now was the sandalwood box!Her rebirth had been due to the sandalwood box, so was her baby brother\u2019s death!She had thought that her previous life\u2019s body and the sandalwood box was nowhere to be found upon her revival but who would have guessed that she would encounter it here!You can also listen onLiked it?

What Does It Have To Do With Me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationSi Yi\u2019s deep eyes scrutinized Yun Jian again.His ears did not fail him, she had mentioned the sandalwood box just now.The object in his hand was indeed the sandalwood box. - An ordinary girl knew it too?\u201cYoung master, what do we do with these people?\u201d The more mature-looking man standing beside Si Yi asked.\u201cThese people\u201d were none other than Yun Jian and Mu Xiang with her gang.\u201cDon\u2019t kill me! No - no!\u201d Mu Xiang was already trembling when she saw Si Yi lift his pistol. Now hearing their conversation, she could only crawl toward where she came from since she was already plopped to the ground.Brother Hu and his lackeys had the color completely drained from their faces while they quivered.Only Yun Jian stood still in silence, not freaking out despite the scene. It was as if they were just fooling around, habitual to one\u2019s daily life.\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Si Yi withdrew his gaze from Yun Jian and instructed the other two males.Three tall silhouettes then disappeared from the spot briefly.Yun Jian did not stop them.The sandalwood box was no longer of much use to her. Her baby brother was dead and her previous life was not worthy of her reminiscence.Quite the contrary, she was living in peace now and she no longer wished to know why she was reborn as well.The alley returned to its usual stillness. The only indicator of what had happened just now was the middle-aged man\u2019s corpse on the ground.Nonetheless, the corpse would disappear by the next day.No matter which organization or group it was, there would be people who specialized in handling corpses and destroying any evidence left.Yun Jian snickered and turned back to see Mu Xiang, Brother Hu and gang flee the spot in panic. She did not linger as well, moving toward the hospital that Qin Yirou was at.The hospital wards at night were usually the quietest.Staying with Qin Yirou for a while, Yun Jian headed home to sleep.As usual, she was up early the next day and continued with her routine, carrying weights and running around Xinjiang Town for training.Then, she went to the hospital to send Qin Yirou breakfast and went to school.Once she entered the classroom, she met someone she did not want to see, Yuan Yingjun.Yun Jian went around him, planning to just ignore the boy.However, it was obvious that Yuan Yingjun was here for Yun Jian as he was determined to be in her way.Yuan Yingjun was in Class (1) of the ninth grade and here he was in Class (6); who else if not her was looking for?\u201cXiao Jian, let\u2019s talk.\u201d Yuan Yingjun could not help swallowing as he stared at Yun Jian\u2019s face that seemed to be prettier each passing day.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re that close with each other, so please don\u2019t call me Xiao Jian. My surname is Yun, first name Jian. Or you can address me as \u2018schoolmate\u2019.\u201d Yun Jian returned Yuan Yingjun\u2019s gaze with her arms crossed in front of her chest smiling when she saw that he was not moving away.Yuan Yingjun\u2019s youthful features darkened a little but he insisted on finishing his speech. \u201cI\u2019ve broken up with Lin Mengyu.\u201d\u201cAnd what does it have to do with me?\u201d Yun Jian retorted.\u201cI know about what happened that day. Lin Mengyu\u2019s at fault. I\u2019ve kept things under control,\u201d Yuan Yingjun told Yun Jian and continued with feigned sincerity, \u201cI was wrong in the past. I\u2019m sorry. But please give me another chance. Would you be my girlfriend?\u201dWas this the reason the teachers and the principal did not come after her in regards to Lin Mengyu? Yuan Yingjun was trying to impress her and change her perception of him?You can also listen onLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I still want to study, don\u2019t disturb me.\u201d Yun Jian refused to engage with Yuan Yingjun any longer, planning to take the longer router away from him to her desk.\u201cXiao Jian, I mean what I say!\u201d Yuan Yingjun was deaf to Yun Jian\u2019s words. He rushed forward to block her from going to her seat.Then, he persisted to pester her thinking that he was cool while doing so. \u201cXiao Jian, I really like you. Be my girlfriend. I\u2019ll protect you and won\u2019t let anyone bully you anymore!\u201dWhile saying so, Yuan Yingjun was thinking about how Yun Jian was acting pure and innocent; he would dump her right away after getting bored with her!Many Class (6)\u2019s girls whispered to each other while they looked at Yun Jian enviously after hearing Yuan Yingjun\u2019s \u201csincere\u201d words.\u201cWow, the most popular guy really is acknowledged to be the school\u2019s hottest boy! He\u2019s so gentle and charming!\u201d\u201cYun Jian can stop putting on a show and look at herself in the mirror. The most handsome guy\u2019s already humbled himself for her, what else does she want?\u201d\u2026Similar adoration and praises toward Yuan Yingjun poured continuously.On the contrary, Class (6)\u2019s girls who admired Yuan Yingjun hated Yun Jian even more.\u201cNot giving way, are you?\u201d Yun Jian chuckled as she watched Yuan Yingjun who was standing in her way.Did he think that she would have no way of going back to her seat by jamming her? Did he think that she would agree to be his girlfriend then?If it were the timid original owner of her body in the past, she might really have agreed when forced to a corner, but Yun Jian now was not the old original self.\u201cXiao Jian, I\u2026\u201d Yuan Yingjun was on his way to spewing more honey coated promises, thinking that Yun Jian must be made of steel when she could still hesitate facing an outstanding person like him\u2026 until he saw what she did.Yun Jian\u2019s leg extended to hook a chair while wearing half a smile; it was eerie to look at. However, the scene did not linger as she stepped onto the chair effortlessly and bent her knees next.What occurred next shocked everyone.When Yun Jian bent her knees and sprung up, she hopped off of the chair.Nimble and controlled, she leaped in a bowed position and was at least two meters away from the floor when she flipped. She actually made it across Yuan Yingjun and landed stably.The series of actions had taken only three seconds.She had leveraged on the chair and flipped two meters high over Yuan Yingjun to smoothly sit herself down on her desk all within three seconds!\u201cOh my god! That\u2019s crazy! Did I just witness China\u2019s traditional wushu! Is Yun Jian a human? She could slip so high up!\u201dAfter two seconds of silence in the classroom, the admiration and adoration of the boys broke out.You can also listen onLiked it?

Waking up so early in the morning, the majority of students wanted to laze about more than anything.This caused Yun Jian\u2019s light and airy narration of her textbook to be a voice that was one of a kind in the entire classroom.Yuan Yingjun stood stationary. His good looking face fell a little.He had come today with brimming confidence that he would have Yun Jian in his grasp.Yet Yun Jian\u2019s flip just now and her current reading voice were both indicating to him that she was blatantly ignoring him!Humans had always liked what they could not obtain. This was the case with Yuan Yingjun too. He gritted his teeth discreetly, swearing to himself that he would seize Yun Jian one day.Now, however, he no longer had the dignity to stay in Class (6). He turned around instantly without making any sound and slipped out of the classroom.It was finally quiet again.Yun Jian pressed her lips together gently and kept the textbook to toss it on the desk.Did Yun Jian just chase away the school\u2019s most popular guy?The early comers who managed to witness the situation looked at Yun Jian in surprise.It was almost certain that the news would spread throughout the school without needing long but that would be a worry for later.\u2026A while after the incident, the bell for the morning self-study session rang. Lu Feiyan had come late today, hurrying into the classroom only after the bell rang.Mu Xiang was absent as expected; what happened yesterday probably left too deep of an impression that she would not dare attend school temporarily.For the next few days, Yun Jian actually did not encounter any cumbersome matters. Yuan Yingjun did not come to her anymore too.Qin Yirou\u2019s hands were gradually healing as well and she was nearly recovered now.Of course, her speedy recovery was because the surgery was done excellently.Qin Yirou was discharged on Friday night. Unpacking and cleaning up upon returning home, she sighed.Since the accident happened, Yun Gang was not once home to visit her. She didn\u2019t even know where he was these days.Nonetheless, Qin Yirou no longer bore any hope in Yun Gang.\u201cXiao Jian, it\u2019s Saturday tomorrow. Go to Longmen City for me and send your brother a blanket. It\u2019s going to be October soon. The weather is constantly changing nowadays, the temperature will drop once it rains. Your brother didn\u2019t bring any thick blanket to school.\u201dQin Yirou told Yun Jian as she dropped a piece of meat into Yun Jian\u2019s bowl during dinner while she only took vegetables.Yun Jian placed the meat back into Qin Yirou\u2019s bowl. \u201cMom, have it. This piece has too much fat, I don\u2019t like it. I\u2019ll go to the city tomorrow and send the blanket. Rest well at home and you\u2019re not allowed to go to work either. You haven\u2019t fully recovered yet. I\u2019ll think of ways to make money.\u201dIf she did not say that she did not like the meat, Qin Yirou would certainly be reluctant to have it. After all, pork was sold for a high price currently.\u201cMy child!\u201d Qin Yirou was really thinking about returning to work at the factory after being discharged today.The family expenditure was a great sum. If she had stayed idle, where would the money come from?Yun Jian had not passed the ten thousand Chinese Yuan to Qin Yirou nor had she told her about it, afraid that it might freak her out.As for Yun Jian\u2019s declaration that she would find ways to make money, Qin Yirou took it as a joke; although, she was comforted by her daughter\u2019s words.Her baby Xiao Jian had grown up and matured.You can also listen onLiked it?

This Is My Younger SisterPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationThe next day was Saturday.Yun Jian woke up early as usual. After her run around Xinjiang Town, she went home and washed up.It was about eight when she took the woven bag storing the blanket that Qin Yirou had folded it in last night and took the eight-thirty bus to Longmen City.The bus ride was one and a half hours long to the city center. Yun Jian got off and boarded Bus No.31 that would drop her off directly at the gate of Di Yi Senior High School.Di Yi Senior High School was the best senior high school in Longmen City housing the best teaching faculties and taking up twenty-five acres of land.In addition, the high school entrance exam admission score of Di Yi Senior High School was particularly high. Those who could make it past the scoring line in Xinjiang Town Junior High School could be counted with the fingers of just one hand and Yun Yi was one of them.During weekends, the gate of Di Yi Senior High School was open to all as some students would go home.There were also many of them who stayed at the school.Yun Jian went straight to Yun Yi\u2019s classroom.To be able to enter Di Yi Senior High School, the results of these students were generally the top in Longmen City; these students shared something common, the initiative to study.Even when it was a weekend without classes and supervising teachers, the students who stayed in school would revise in class on their own.When Yun Jian arrived at Yun Yi\u2019s classroom, she saw her brother diligently completing a workbook inside without surprise. As expected, there were many more students in the room who were studying on their own accord.\u201cHey guys, look! There\u2019s a little girl at our door! How pretty. Are you looking for anyone in our class?\u201d There were also boys who huddled together playing cards out of boredom and one of them coincidentally faced the door, calling out at once when he saw Yun Jian.His holler caused everyone in the classroom to look over at Yun Jian.Seeing that it was his sister, Yun Yi stood up in delight and went to her.\u201cXiao Jian! Why are you here?\u201d The excitement was obvious in Yun Yi\u2019s tone as he asked Yun Jian.\u201cMom asked me to send you a blanket. The weather is turning cold soon. Mom\u2019s worried that you\u2019d be cold,\u201d Yun Jian answered as she dropped the bulky woven bag to one side.Nodding, Yun Yi took the heavy bag from Yun Jian while asking, \u201cHow is mom\u2019s injury?\u201d\u201cMom\u2019s discharged now and healing pretty well,\u201d Yun Jian replied with a sweet smile.The answer soothed Yun Yi\u2019s frown.\u201cHey yo, little beauty, where are you from? Tsch, tsch, you can\u2019t be Yun Yi\u2019s girlfriend?\u201d Another boy came from the classroom out of the blue and wrapped his arm around Yun Yi\u2019s shoulder out of habit, teasing the siblings good-naturedly.The boy\u2019s features were distinct, as good looking as Yun Yi was.\u201cNonsense! This is my younger sister!\u201d Yun Yi slapped the hand away from his shoulder and explained before turning back to Yun Jian to introduce the boy to her. \u201cHe\u2019s Xu Haozhe, a good friend of mine. A jokester as well. Don\u2019t take him too seriously!\u201dYun Jian nodded and smiled softly.So this person was her brother\u2019s friend in school?\u201cHeh heh heh.\u201d Xu Haozhe chuckled and properly greeted Yun Jian.\u201cXiao Jian, let me take you around the city and have lunch together before you go back since you hardly come here,\u201d Yun Yi told Yun Jian after chatting briefly.\u201cSure.\u201d Yun Jian nodded.You can also listen onLiked it?

He looked at his younger sister and said gently, \u201cXiao Jian, I didn\u2019t manage to take you here the last time due to mom\u2019s accident. We\u2019ll buy whatever you want today!\u201dYun Yi\u2019s allowance came from saving up his meal money. He was unwilling to spend it himself but he was generous when it came to his sister.If he did buy all sorts of toys that young girls like her were fond of, Yun Yi might just eat buns and plain water instead of proper meals.Warmth filled Yun Jian\u2019s heart as she shook her head at Yun Yi. \u201cWe\u2019ll just look around. I don\u2019t need to buy anything.\u201dShe had money but it was inappropriate to take it out carelessly.In spite of it, it was beyond doubt that she would better the condition of her family legitimately. It would not take long.She was determined to let Yun Yi and Qin Yirou live comfortably!\u201cAy, what are the both of you fussing over? Buy what you want, I\u2019ll take care of the bill today!\u201d Xu Haozhe announced generously, as he knew how Yun Yi\u2019s family was doing, draping his arm over Yun Yi\u2019s shoulder to march forward.Xu Haozhe\u2019s family was relatively well off and he was usually easygoing, never once looking down on the poor.Shopping the city center once, Xu Haozhe pulled Yun Yi and Yun Jian toward the direction of a lavish hotel.\u201cI said that I\u2019ll take care of the bill today. If not, that means that both of you are looking down on me!\u201d Xu Haozhe said as he dragged them to the hotel.Xu Haozhe was truly a friend worthy of a genuine bond.He often took turns with Yun Yi buying each other meals; when it was Yun Yi\u2019s turn to buy them meals, they would eat at small shops and stalls, but when it was Xu Haozhe\u2019s turn, he insisted on taking him to hotels.A friend like this was honestly hard to come by.The posh restaurant had a poetic name, Crystal Rhythm Hotel.The Crystal Rhythm Hotel was a four-star hotel, one of the very few four-star hotels in Longmen City. A meal here could cost half a month\u2019s salary of an average worker.It was unquestionable that Xu Haozhe\u2019s family was quite wealthy, even though Yun Yi did not know in particular what they did.Entering the hotel, Xu Haozhe asked for a small room right away. The waiter led them to the first floor.Smaller rooms were on the corner of the first floor\u2019s east wing. As the trio followed the waiter through other rooms, they walked past a bigger room by chance.Zhang Tiejun and his wife, Qin Junlan, were seated in the big room holding glasses of wine and chattering animatedly with their client.Suddenly, Qin Junlan caught sight of the three teenagers through the door that remained open when their server came in to serve dishes just now.\u201cYun Jian! Yun Yi! Why are the two of you here!\u201d Qin Junlan sprang up from her seat swiftly when she saw them, walking out click-clacking on her heels.Yun Jian had just walked past the door when she heard the sharp and familiar voice of Qin Junlan. She squinted and halted her eyes, turning around to face the woman only to see her stomping over.\u201cHow could you guys be here? There\u2019s no free lunch here. Can you afford it? Are you planning to dine and dash!\u201d Qin Junlan made assumptions, loudly claiming them right before everyone else.Her strident voice was as if to make sure others could hear her, not at all behavior expected of an aunt.You can also listen onLiked it?

Bullsh*t!This was why Qin Junlan hollered at the kids in such a condescending tone.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we be here? Is it because we can\u2019t be at where you are?\u201d Yun Jian scoffed.She disliked her aunt from the bottom of her heart.\u201cOh, look, this kid snaps back at her aunt! Disrespectful. I really don\u2019t know how Yirou teaches you two! Can you two feast here with how your family is doing?\u201d Qin Junlan hurled back.Qin Junlan spoke with one sole intention, to indirectly tell Yun Jian that they still owed her money.How would they dare have a treat here when they had yet to return their debt!Considering the fact that there were outsiders here and Qin Junlan had her appearance to keep, she gritted her teeth looking at Yun Jian and Yun Yi before she put up a well-mannered facade the next second and said, \u201cI\u2019m not accusing you. Your mother makes hard-earned money. It\u2019s not for you both to splurge like this!\u201dShe was basically hinting that the money they owed was still unreturned!\u201cI\u2019m Yun Yi\u2019s friend. I\u2019m buying them this meal. Yun Yi has never misspent a cent. You shouldn\u2019t say untrue things like this, Yun Yi\u2019s aunt!\u201d Xu Haozhe stood up for Yun Yi immediately.One could hear how much Qin Junlan hated both Yun Yi and Yun Jian as long as they were not a fool.Xu Haozhe had been piqued by Qin Junlan\u2019s tone, thus countering for the siblings.\u201cYou?\u201d It was only then that Qin Junlan shifted her gaze from her niece and nephew to Xu Haozhe.Xu Haozhe was nicely dressed, not appearing as a poor kid who came from deprived conditions.In addition, he said that he was treating Yun Jian and Yun Yi the meal.It was a known fact that a meal here cost significantly.Xu Haozhe was Yun Yi\u2019s age yet he could wine and dine here as he pleased. That must mean that he was a rich kid?Qin Junlan who was about to lash out relented at once when she thought about a rich family\u2019s son being Yun Yi\u2019s friend. Her attitude changed swiftly.\u201cAy, Xiao Jian, Xiao Yi, I\u2019m only giving you reminders just now. After all, your mother\u2019s salary doesn\u2019t come easy. You two must understand\u2026\u201d Qin Junlan\u2019s approach was a speedy switch from aggressive to gentle.If Yun Yi was really friends with the son of some affluent family, his future would be promising! Maybe she could even share some benefits as his aunt!Qin Junlan had completely forgotten how overbearing she was when she confronted the siblings just now.You can also listen onLiked it?

I\u2019ll take care of my mom,\u201d Yun Jian told Qin Junlan.\u201cOutsiders pointing fingers\u201d was no doubt Qin Junlan.Once Qin Junlan heard Yun Jian calling her a busybody and wanted to explode, she endured it due to her previous considerations. However, she thought about it and was disgruntled, deciding that she wanted to say more.Out of the blue, Yun Jian felt the changes in the atmosphere.\u201cTss! Tss!\u201dShe caught two soft sounds that would usually go unnoticed by a normal person.As a secret agent in her previous life, Yun Jian was a survivor who lived on stepping across countless corpses; she had survived only after killing the children who were also seized and trained by the organization.During those times, being slightly off guard would mean being killed by her peers. She had no choice but to kill her peers and her friends if she wished to stay alive.Consequently, Yun Jian who had survived under such circumstances was extremely sensitive to soft noises that the ordinary people could not notice.A bullet from a silencer!There was a sniper around them!As Yun Jian, Yun Yi and Xu Haozhe stood by the room\u2019s entrance, they were right in the middle of the doorway. The sound of the bullet came from the window in the room that was open for ventilation.Before she could contemplate, Yun Jian had stretched her leg and kicked Qin Junlan.The latter fell instantly without being able to react from the pain.At the same time, Yun Jian\u2019s hand flew to tug at Yun Yi before pushing him to the floor, doing the same to Xu Haozhe with her other hand, while she turned away to avoid the ambush.Two bullets that came from a silencer slid past her cheeks respectively and catapulted into the white wall behind her, creating two unmistakable holes.Yun Jian who avoided the bullets squinted her eyes.She was rebirthed and had no enemy now. The target of the sniper was certainly not her.From the direction of the ambush, the sniper actually wanted to kill\u2026 him - Xu Haozhe!The three people whom Yun Jian had pushed to the floor had no idea what happened.Shot from a silencer rifle, the bullets merely made the tiniest noise that could not be heard if one were not a professional.In other words, one would probably not know the cause of death even if one was shot.Qin Junlan who was shoved by Yun Jian could no longer reel herself back. She had thought that the girl had knocked her to the floor on purpose to embarrass her. Standing up, she shouted at Yun Jian, \u201cWhat are you doing, Yun Jian! Are you going to hit your own aunt? You impudent girl, do you have any morals\u2026\u201dYun Yi also stroked his head as he picked himself up in a daze, looking at his baby sister who had pushed him for nothing.It was Xu Haozhe who seemed to be struck by realization but heard Yun Jian saying curtly just as he stood up, \u201cThere\u2019s a sniper here. Leave quickly!\u201dA sniper?It was not the first time the group had heard this word. A sniper was a gunman who usually appeared in movies.Qin Junlan scolded aloud once she heard Yun Jian\u2019s words.\u201cA sniper? Why is there a sniper out of the blue? You kids have watched too many movies, haven\u2019t you? Delusional now, aren\u2019t you? Nonsense, nonsense\u2026\u201d Qin Junlan suddenly bit her tongue.Right in front of her, two big holes on the clean wall greeted her.The glaring bullets were stuck in the center having penetrated the wall.From the position, the first bullet would be going through Qin Junlan\u2019s head instead if Yun Jian had not tripped her just now.\u201cAh! Ah\u2026\u201d Qin Junlan began crying out of fright as she shook like a leaf upon realization.Oh god, would she have survived if the bullet had punctured her head just now\u2026Yun Yi and Xu Haozhe had similarly noticed the two bullets embedded on the wall.Both of them looked back at Yun Jian in disbelief.There was really a sniper around and if it were not for Yun Jian\u2019s spontaneity, the consequences were unimaginable\u2026In spite of it, Yun Yi thought that he knew Yun Jian well as her elder brother yet his sister had\u2026Yun Jian\u2019s rushed voice came again. \u201cBoth of you, leave now. Find a place and hide! Quick!\u201dThe sniper hiding would shoot at Xu Haozhe again once their angle was again adjusted.You can also listen onLiked it?

Those people are after me, I can\u2019t burden you guys,\u201d Xu Haozhe critically explained with his fists clenched looking at the siblings.He gave up pretending and flipped the edge of his shirt up to retrieve a pistol from his belt.\u201cZhe, you\u2026\u201d Yun Yi\u2019s eyes widened at Xu Haozhe, unable to believe that his best friend had been carrying a pistol with him all the time.Xu Haozhe chuckled humorlessly as he looked at Yun Yi with an unshaken resolution. \u201cYi, sorry I lied to you. I\u2019m actually the son of Dragon Head Gang\u2019s boss.\u201dHis identity had predetermined his uncommon future.The Dragon Head Gang was the top mafia of Longmen City\u2019s black market and controlled the underground trade of Longmen City.There was no doubt that Xu Haozhe could produce a pistol since he was the mafia boss\u2019 son.Yun Yi was apparently astounded. He did not expect his best friend to come from such a background.He finally understood why Xu Haozhe had never mentioned his family condition in front of him.\u201cLeave quickly. This has nothing to do with both of you. There\u2019s no need to get you guys involved!\u201d Xu Haozhe shouted at Yun Yi, who had accepted death as the worst case scenario.\u201cWill you be able to leave here alive on your own? The sniper is dead set on you,\u201d Yun Jian finally spoke after a long time of being still, squinting her eyes.Xu Haozhe was the sniper\u2019s target. As long as he was exposed within the shooting range, he would be killed for sure.Even if Xu Haozhe was somehow skilled, he was definitely inadequate to overpower the sniper.Xu Haozhe and Yun Yi shifted the gaze to Yun Jian. How could she speak like this at this critical moment?\u201cEven then, I can\u2019t drag you two into this!\u201d Xu Haozhe looked at Yun Jian square in the eyes and replied.Yun Yi was his best friend. He would never allow him and his younger sister to get entangled in danger because of him.Yun Jian studied Xu Haozhe again and suddenly stuck her hand out. Blinking, she calmly stated, \u201cAlright then, give me the pistol.\u201dBased solely on Xu Haozhe\u2019s response just now, Yun Jian had decided to save the boy.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d Xu Haozhe\u2019s eyes bulged as he was momentarily stunned.Give her the pistol? Did she know how to use it?That would be impossible! This was a pistol!Yun Yi stared at Yun Jian in mirroring shock.Lo and behold, Yun Jian stepped forward and grabbed the pistol in Xu Haozhe\u2019s hand, spinning it twice in her grip smoothly.\u201cItalian made Beretta, effective shooting range fifty meters, that\u2019s enough,\u201d Yun Jian mumbled to herself whilst playing with the pistol.However, her words sounded like earth-shattering tides to Xu Haozhe.She could actually recognize the gun type?Moreover, her ease of handling the pistol appeared to not be her first time seeing a gun; she looked more like a veteran who had been fiddling with guns for years.How old was she again? - But she was Yun Yi\u2019s younger sister, how was it possible for her to come into contact with pistols?Amidst Xu Haozhe\u2019s shock and Yun Yi\u2019s astonishment, Yun Jian left them. \u201cStay here and don\u2019t come out\u201d. She moved toward the door where the sniper could shoot her in a side lane.Had she gone crazy? She would be shot going out uncovered!A crazier thought sprouted in Xu Haozhe and Yun Yi\u2019s mind.Was Yun Jian trying to shoot the sniper with the pistol instead?How was that possible?You can also listen onLiked it?

The bullets were fired toward Yun Jian\u2019s position from a high point.The speed of the bullet was not visible to the eyes but posed no challenge to Yun Jian.\u201cXiao Jian!\u201d Without a second thought, Yun Yi wanted to charge out to protect his younger sister but Xu Haozhe kept a death grip on him.In all honesty, Xu Haozhe wanted to do the same; this had happened because of him anyway.When he saw Yun Jian\u2019s deftness and reflected upon her agility that saved them from the first round of shooting, he hesitated.If Yun Jian was not capable, how could she have sensed the shots and pulled them down to safety?Quite the opposite, if he were exposed to the sniper, he would probably be shot to death without a struggle.For this reason, they would become a burden to Yun Jian\u2019s instead, whether it was him or Yun Yi who went out of hiding.As the three bullets were fired, Yun Jian did not back down. She rolled across the floor holding the pistol whilst avoiding the shots. She then stood up to continue going closer to the window. - Until she was completely visible to the sniper.Theoretically, this was easier for the sniper to kill her.Would the outcome actually be so?Was she unafraid of death? Or was she fully confident?Xu Haozhe frowned.When Yun Yi saw the bullets brushing past his baby sister once again before lodging into the floor, his heart nearly stopped beating from the brimming anguish.What surprised him further was that Xiao Jian had avoided the round of firing! The sniper was shooting bullets, it was no game!\u201cFuck!\u201d The sniper who was hidden at the best vantage point could not help cursing when he saw how easily Yun Jian had avoided his strafing, even whilst standing where she was the most easily to be shot.Was the girl even eighteen yet? She had evaded his ambush!More crucially, she dared expose herself. Was she hinting to him that he could not kill her?Angered, the sniper readjusted his aim; his pointer finger went to the trigger, about to end Yun Jian.\u201cTss!\u201dThe sound of a gunshot that the sniper was more than familiar with reverberated. He looked up abruptly to see the girl standing at the window withdrawing her pistol with a sly grin.With a plop, the sniper collapsed on the floor in the next second, killed by a headshot.Yun Jian had used a mere pistol in shooting the sniper!Xu Haozhe stood in hiding but he could see the scene clearly. He suppressed the shock that was tremoring through him despite shaking uncontrollably.His eyes must not have been mistaken!It was one shot! Yun Jian had lifted her arm and gunned down the sniper some distance away!Counter-shooting a sniper? Xu Haozhe was sure that he had never heard of something as bizarre as this before.\u201cBang, blasted the head.\u201d Dropping the pistol, Yun Jian\u2019s lips were pressed together and pulled into an eerie angle.There was no hint of fear or anxiety that came from killing a person from her expression.Just the opposite, Xu Haozhe and Yun Yi saw a sense of default on Yun Jian\u2019s face as if she had always been such a person.Yun Yi let out a huge breath of relief when he saw that Yun Jian was unscathed before he frowned slightly.Was this brutal Xiao Jian still his baby sister of the past?You can also listen onLiked it?

A Welcoming PartyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euYun Yi could not help but be suspicious of Yun Jian.Since he went back home the last time, Xiao Jian had been acting strangely.There was the phone call in Xinjiang Town\u2019s shop and her inexplicable skills, too.If it were not for Yun Jian\u2019s appearance remaining the same, he questioned if she had switched souls with someone else.Ultimately, Yun Yi chose to hold himself back from asking.He chose to believe in his younger sister. Even if something had changed, he believed that Xiao Jian would tell him one day!Likewise, Yun Jian realized Yun Yi\u2019s change but she did not point it out, also deciding to skip explaining.She had nothing to say, honestly, as she could not explain it to Yun Yi.If she had not done something just now, were they just going to wait for their doom?This was not her.Yun Jian turned around to speak to Xu Haozhe, \u201cThe Dragon Head Gang will take care of the sniper\u2019s body right?\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026 Mm, yes.\u201d Xu Haozhe replied hastily after a beat, still caught in a stupor.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian nodded with a hum and smiled. \u201cBut it looks like we have no luck to enjoy this feast.\u201dXu Haozhe and Yun Yi were baffled again.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xu Haozhe asked in a trance.\u201cSomeone called the police. And they\u2019re here, downstairs,\u201d answered Yun Jian.\u201cHow do you know?!\u201d It came out as an exclamation from Xu Haozhe.They did not hear anything from downstairs and Yun Jian was here with them. How could she know what was happening there?\u201cI heard it.\u201d Yun Jian smiled and continued. \u201cFollow me, we\u2019ll leave through the backdoor.\u201dShe then led the way.Up till they had left through the four-star hotel\u2019s backdoor, Xu Haozhe and Yun Yi were both still stupefied.Countless questions bubbled within them, the most vital one being why was Yun Jian so familiar with the backdoor here.Xu Haozhe was a regular guest here but even he did not know where the backdoor of the hotel was. Why was Yun Jian clear about the route?If Yun Jian knew of their thoughts, she would grin without a doubt.The reason she was excellent with investigations, reverse tracking, and hiding was due to her strong sense of observation. For example, how would she hide, escape, or counter kill someone if she encountered an emergency?These were the necessary courses of a secret agent.That was why she had analyzed her surroundings once she stepped foot into the hotel just now.\u2026The trio did not expect to run into an incident earlier but Xu Haozhe had still insisted to foot the bill for their meals.After lunch, Yun Jian took the bus back home.She actually had nothing much to do in Longmen City. Some things were not urgent, like the business she proposed to set up earlier.Yun Jian arrived home around three-thirty in the afternoon and saw Li Xiangyi standing dumbly at her door.Puzzled, Yun Jian went to him.\u201cWow, Yun Jian, you\u2019re finally home! After some painstaking effort, I found your house only to hear your neighbor say that your entire family isn\u2019t around! I\u2019ve been waiting for you for close to half an hour now!\u201d Li Xiangyi could not help grumbling when he saw Yun Jian.No one home? Qin Yirou was not home?Yun Jian was slightly at a loss.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Yun Jian asked, looking at Li Xiangyi before her.\u201cOh, so the basketball team plans to throw you a mini welcoming party tonight.

It was held to welcome her into the basketball team?Yun Jian was flummoxed because this was the first time a welcoming party was held to celebrate her addition into the group.\u201cHey, what\u2019s up?\u201d Li Xiangyi waved his hand in front of Yun Jian seeing that she showed no reaction.\u201cOh, go on.\u201d Yun Jian signaled that she was still listening.\u201cIt\u2019s set then. Six o\u2019clock this evening. Head straight to the bar to meet up with the rest.\u201d Li Xiangyi chuckled and bid goodbye after he finished his message.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian nodded, pressing her lips together.Yun Jian made her way into her house after Li Xiangyi left but a frown etched between her brows once she opened the door.The living room greeting her sight was supposed to be clean and tidy but it looked like a burglar had swept the space upside down.The rubbish inside the trashcan on the floor was spilled everywhere while cabinets and drawers were opened. It was evident that someone had rummaged through everything.From the living room to the kitchen and to the bedroom, the clutter and mess were unbelievable.What happened at home when she was in Longmen City?\u201cHah, hah, hah\u2026\u201dBrisk footsteps came from the door as a panting girl stepped through approaching Yun Jian.Simultaneously, Yun Jian was able to properly see the girl.It was a dainty girl who looked like a goody two shoes; she was probably thirteen or fourteen years old but was petite in size.Raking through her memory, Yun Jian knew that this was her uncle\u2019s daughter, Yun Xiaoya, who usually did not interact much with the original owner of her body. Why was she here at her house today?Yun Xiaoya huffed and puffed several times and ignored her breathlessness from running too fast to cry out to Yun Jian, \u201cSis, uncle has a nasty woman outside and that nasty woman came here today. She\u2019s at the community hall right now fighting auntie!\u201dYun Xiaoya was the daughter of Yun Jian\u2019s uncle, so the uncle Yun Xiaoya referred to was Yun Jian\u2019s current father, Yun Gang.The auntie Yun Xiaoya spoke of was naturally, Qin Yirou.Yun Jian\u2019s eyes twitched. She thought that Qin Yirou was working at the factory.That was not the point.Point was, Yun Gang had a mistress?As a father of two children, Yun Gang had fled into disappearance after borrowing from the loan sharks and being unable to repay his debt, throwing the burden to his family.Now, he was keeping a mistress outside?More crucially, the mistress was here to beat her mother up when the man had vanished for days?Yun Jian was infuriated.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d She called out to Yun Xiaoya and was already out of the door to the community hall, not even shutting it tight.At the entrance of Xinjiang Town Community Hall, people in town were gathered to watch the drama unfolding there and then.A woman who was dressed rather fashionably was violently grabbing Qin Yirou\u2019s hair with her heavily manicured hand and assaulting her right near the center door.The crowd tried to pull her away but her strength was too great and they were unable to separate the women.Qin Yirou felt like her scalp was being torn apart. Her hands were still recovering so she was weak to begin with; there was no way she could overcome that woman. Helpless, she could only endure the pain of her hair being yanked around.\u201cOld woman! Old hag! How dare you compete against me with how you look! You must be blind!\u201d The mistress spat whilst vehemently jerking Qin Yirou\u2019s hair.The passersby shook their head sighing. This was a mistress yet she sounded so righteous. What was happening to the world?This was the scene that Yun Jian witnessed when she got here.The mistress was wrenching Qin Yirou\u2019s hair left and right while people around them who wanted to stop her were pushed away.The flame of fury erupted within Yun Jian. This was the first time she was so livid.The situation was turbulent and getting out of control.Swiftly, Yun Jian was in front of the mistress with a few steps.The crowd was surprised.Who was this girl who had suddenly appeared?Before anyone could figure out, Yun Jian was already in front of the heated woman and flung her wrist.\u201cSlap!\u201d A smack landed on the mistress\u2019 cheek.The strike was incredibly powerful.Forced to let go of her vice grip on Qin Yirou\u2019s hair from the momentum, the mistress\u2019 face was almost deformed by Yun Jian\u2019s force.She fell onto the ground with a thud, shocking the audience.They knew how strong the mistress was as she could keep her clenching fist on Qin Yirou\u2019s hair despite numerous people pulling her away.Yet this young girl who had appeared out of nowhere had just flung the woman away the moment she got here!How powerful must her slap be when it nearly contorted the woman\u2019s face!You can also listen onLiked it?

She stayed motionless as Yun Jian picked her up, looking numb.\u201cMom,\u201d Yun Jian called out softly feeling a pang on her heart.She did not know how to comfort others and could only hug her mother who was stranded in hopelessness. She placed her hand on Qin Yirou\u2019s back and gently patted her to ease her misery.Yun Jian knew that Qin Yirou could turn a blind eye to everything that Yun Gang had committed prior to this.However, having a mistress; was something she could not forgive.Otherwise, she would have long divorced Yun Gang and lived alone.The main reason Qin Yirou had persevered so many years in the marriage was for the children.She did not want her children to lose their father.No matter how useless Yun Yang was, he had never had an affair. This was also why Qin Yirou continued putting up with him.The husband and wife had long lost their passion for each other, their children being the only link that tied them together.\u201cXiao - Xiao Jian, my - my heart hurts\u2026\u201d Qin Yirou shakily muttered.\u201cMom, I\u2019ll protect you from now on!\u201d Yun Jian stroked the woman\u2019s back and said resolutely.The passersby whispered to each other, the audience gaining number as they gathered around the community hall to watch the drama.\u201cXiao Jian\u2026 Sis Yirou\u2026\u201d A middle-aged man who was in his forties appeared before them and carefully called out.This man was Yun Xiaoya\u2019s father, Yun Jian\u2019s uncle, Yun Zheng.The Yun household had two sons, the elder Yun Zheng was down to earth working as a farmer, and the younger Yun Gang, Yun Jian\u2019s father.Yun Gang was never a pragmatic man, addicted to gambling and even drinking.Even Yun Zheng believed that Qin Yirou suffered having married to his younger brother Yun Gang.\u201cUncle.\u201d Yun Jian gently acknowledged the man dressed in farming clothes, with her hand still soothing Qin Yirou, feeling that she had calmed down from the surge of emotions just now.In her memory, her uncle was not one to spill his guts for their family but he was not immoral to them either.At least, Yun Zheng had come to help Qin Yirou when he saw her being beaten by the mistress only to fail because the mistress was very strong.\u201cHey.\u201d Yun Zheng greeted back before softly sighing.\u201cAy, the mistress is running away! She\u2019s escaping because she can\u2019t win! No way!\u201d A nosy woman cried among the watching crowd.Holding Qin Yirou, Yun Jian turned to see the mistress standing up from the ground and grabbing her purse, planning to slip away from the commotion.Was she planning to leave after hitting her mother?As everyone thought that the mistress was going to leave just like this, Yun Jian bent down to pick up a stone from the ground.What was she doing?The bystanders including Yun Zheng and Yun Xiaoya were perplexed.From what Yun Zheng remembered, his niece had always been a timid child. However, she had stepped forward and slapped the mistress just now.In the midst of everyone\u2019s doubt, Yun Jian picked up the stone and threw it toward the direction of the mistress.Unlike normal stone, in the hands of Yun Jian, the harmless pebble was akin to a sharp blade.The crowd heard a plop and saw the mistress kneeling on the ground. The stone that Yun Jian had tossed dropped beside her.A tiny pebble had actually made someone kneel down?The audience was still in shock when they watched Yun Jian walking over to a nearby bench to help Qin Yirou rest.\u201cYou hit my mom and crashed my house. Are you thinking to leave here alive without an explanation?\u201d Yun Jian spoke flatly.Monotonous. - Those who were familiar with Yun Jian would have known that this was a sign of Yun Jian\u2019s wrath.The consequences would be grave.You can also listen onLiked it?

You brat, what are you talking about? Who are you trying to scare? I\u2019ve been accustomed to intimidation since I was a kid, do you think I\u2019ll be scared of you?\u201dFrom the start, the mistress had a feisty character. She had wanted to escape amidst the chaos when realizing that she would not be able to gain anything, not expecting Yun Jian to strike again. Her temper erupted at once, making her shout at Yun Jian.Also from Xinjiang Town, the mistress was about thirty years old but looked like she was in her twenties having taken good care of herself.The reason she had attached herself to Yun Gang was that the gambling addict did not always lose when he went to the casino. There were even times when he won hundreds of thousands.Unmistakably, Yun Gang had never brought home the money he had won, using them to buy luxury purses for the mistress instead. They lived lavishly in delight.That was why the mistress was entangled with Yun Gang and why Qin Yirou thought that Yun Gang had never won in the casino. - He did win but it had all gone to his mistress.Having come here today, it was because Yun Gang had disappeared, fleeing after borrowing from the loan sharks. Since her money tree was gone, the mistress thought that she might as well throw a fit at Qin Yirou\u2019s house.She had the audacity to ask for compensation and whatnot, obviously refused by Qin Yirou, causing both of them to engage in an argument and progressing into this current state.Yun Jian ignored the mistress\u2019 brazen words and continued to walk toward her.\u201cXiao Jian, what are you doing?\u201d Yun Zheng asked.His heart was thumping hard; for some reason, he had a premonition that something was going to happen.The mistress on the other side was completely unaware of the approaching danger. Rather, she patted down her hair and flicked her hand, looking at Yun Jian scornfully as she continued to mock her.\u201cYour old hag of a mother, can you blame me when she can\u2019t stop her husband from having a lover? If I have to say it aloud, a woman old and ugly like your mom, even if she dies, it\u2019s not worthy of - ah!\u201dThe rest of her words were stuck in the mistress\u2019 throat as Yun Jian flashed in front of the woman with a swift step.With an iron grip, she grabbed a fistful of the mistress\u2019s hair and dragged her along.\u201cAh! What are you doing? You insolent brat, bastard child! Let go of your dirty hands!\u201d The mistress tried to retaliate but with each struggle, she realized that she could not even touch the edge of Yun Jian\u2019s clothes; she had no idea that Yun Jian\u2019s silence signified her impending doom, so her sharp tongue turned more venomous.\u201cYou\u2019ve pulled my mom\u2019s hair just now, haven\u2019t you? It\u2019s time for your payback now.\u201d Yun Jian\u2019s low tone was audible to everyone as she kept her clutch on the woman\u2019s hair.The audience once again felt chills.A terrifying scene greeted them the next second.With one hand holding the mistress down, Yun Jian\u2019s other hand grabbed her hair and wrenched it harshly.Like tugging wool from sheep, a fistful of the mistress\u2019 hair was jerked off her scalp by Yun Jian.Once Yun Jian was done, she moved on to wrench another fistful of hair, stopping only when the mistress had passed out from screaming, her once pretty hair now yanked off and was bleeding from the scalp.You can also listen onLiked it?

Her scalp was profusely bleeding but no one around them stepped up to help.Mistresses from adulteries had always been the most loathed presence. What was more, this mistress was vehement and unabashed even when she knew she was the third party of one\u2019s marriage.Other than Qin Yirou who was still engulfed in her anguish and did not notice Yun Jian\u2019s doing, everyone else around them looked at the girl in horror. Some of them had even turned around, unable to stomach the gory scene.\u201cFrom now on, this is the repercussion of whoever dares bully my mom!\u201d Yun Jian was frighteningly quiet when she spoke calmly and pointed at the unconscious mistress.\u201cAnd, if anyone among you dares spread rumors about what happened today, I\u2019ll make sure they won\u2019t be able to speak forever. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can very well try!\u201d Yun Jian\u2019s deep eyes scanned the audience.Yun Gang had an affair, his mistress guiltlessly came to ask for money and beat the wife up.Yun Jian knew that the gossipers among the current onlookers would exaggerate and add their own take to the story before long if she did not speak up first.She would never allow something like this to happen.Perhaps it was because of Yun Jian\u2019s ruthless action just now. No one dared to make a sound.Everyone was thinking about only one thing. - The girl was only fifteen years old yet she did not even blink having done something so callous.A while later, the crowd dispersed quietly.Yun Zheng hesitated for some time before walking up to Yun Jian. Looking at his niece who now seemed so unfamiliar to him, he pressed his lips together. \u201cXiao Jian, you\u2026\u201dWords had come to the edge of his lips but they were swallowed again.He could not be asking Yun Jian to abandon her father, could he? That was his biological younger brother after all.\u201cUncle, thank you for asking Xiaoya to inform me. I\u2019ll take mom home first then.\u201d Yun Jian alleviated the awkward atmosphere and went to help Qin Yirou up from the bench before they slowly made their way home.Yun Gang was the culprit of all these happenings yet he had fled alone and left only troubles for Qin Yirou.Yun Jian decided that she could not let her mother go on living with such a man.Any intention to sort out the matter had only made it more complicated. This should have come to an end ages ago.Upon returning home, Yun Jian sat Qin Yirou down and poured her a glass of warm water.Qin Yirou had not uttered a word during their walk home; Yun Jian\u2019s heart ached for her.A few days ago when Qin Yirou had an accident, it was not known where Yun Gang her husband was. Now, his lover came knocking at their door.He had even left them with a huge amount of debt but was nowhere to be found.Although Yun Jian had repaid the debt, a person like this was unworthy of being her father.Yun Jian made Qin Yirou dinner and left the house punctually at 5:50pm. She did not forget Li Xiangyi\u2019s invitation even though Qin Yirou\u2019s current state was still worrisome.\u201cMom, I\u2019m heading out for a bit. Remember to have dinner! Health is ours, don\u2019t mistreat yourself,\u201d Yun Jian tucked a few strands of Qin Yirou\u2019s silver hair behind her ear coming, as she approached her with a somber tone.\u201cGo along, Xiao Jian. I\u2019m okay, I\u2019m fine, really.\u201d Qin Yirou forced the words out of her pale lips, pulling them into a futile smile to appease Yun Jian.Yun Jian nodded, knowing that she should give Qin Yirou some time alone to digest the events.

She lived not far from the rock and roll bar, so when she arrived at the entrance it was precisely 6:00pm.\u201cHey, Yun Jian, over here!\u201d Yun Jian walked over having seen Li Xiangyi waving his arm at her from a distance away.\u201cYou\u2019re right on the dot huh!\u201d Wu Kui teased Yun Jian after a glance at his watch.\u201c6 o\u2019clock, I\u2019m not late.\u201d Yun Jian pressed her lips together lightly.\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Li Xiangyi chuckled and pulled the tall handsome boy over to introduce her. \u201cYun Jian, this is our basketball team captain, Wen Rui. Get to know him!\u201dWen Rui was the captain of the basketball team but he had not made an appearance before this.Glancing at him, Wen Rui was like a ray of sunshine; he looked youthful, appearing cheery and warm.\u201cNice to meet you!\u201d Wen Rui was the first to make the greeting.\u201cNice to meet you too, I\u2019m Yun Jian.\u201d Yun Jian returned the gesture.\u201cHeh heh, we\u2019re all here. Why are we still at the door? Let\u2019s head in!\u201d Li Xiangyi laughed and entered the rock and roll bar jostling with the other boys in the team.\u201cLet\u2019s go in too,\u201d said Wen Rui with a gentle smile.It was hard to imagine that a warm radiant boy who exuded the aura of a studious scholar was also the captain of the school\u2019s basketball team.Nonetheless, it paled in comparison to the mystical encounters that Yun Jian had encountered.The team headed inside the bar.The rock and roll bar lived to its name; with rock and roll as the theme, its interior was fully furnished in a western flair.There was not a big crowd in the bar at this point in time but there were still guests. After all, the only bar was in Xinjiang Town; people from the neighboring towns who wanted to relax had to come here.To welcome Yun Jian into the basketball team, Li Xiangyi had already made arrangements earlier and booked a room for the team.The teenagers were led to the room by a server once they entered the bar.When they passed by the bar counter, a group of people who were dressed like delinquents blocked their way.The boy who stood front and foremost and was dressed like a rich brat looked at Wen Rui lazily. There was a sense of hostility in his tone when he said, \u201cAy, Wen Rui, I heard that your basketball team recruited a new member? A girl, too, ain\u2019t that true?\u201dThere was an apparent halt in Wen Rui\u2019s steps when he saw the boy.As foes, their eyes were ablaze upon meeting each other.Wen Rui met the boy\u2019s gaze with equal hostility and spoke through his clenched teeth, \u201cZhang Jun, leave us alone. I don\u2019t want to quarrel with you today.\u201dThe boy named Zhang Jun was from Dongjiang Town, a town next to Xinjiang Town. He was also a ninth grader, attending Dongjiang Town Junior High School.Coincidentally, Zhang Jun was also the captain of Dongjiang Town Junior High School\u2019s basketball team.The basketball friendly match that was scheduled a few days from now was between Xinjiang Town Junior High and Dongjiang Town Junior High.Of course, there were only so many coincidences in this world. Zhang Jun most probably had already known that they were going to throw Yun Jian a welcoming party here and purposely made his way here to \u201cjoin them\u201d.\u201cYo, yo, what do you mean? Wen Rui, we\u2019re only here to see your team\u2019s new member. Do you have to be so petty?\u201dZhang Jun had a wayward vibe to him as he stretched his neck to scrutinize Yun Jian.Then, he mocked again. \u201cOh look, this girl can play basketball too huh? Thin arms, thin legs, she\u2019s pretty though. But don\u2019t tell me that you guys are planning to let this vase play against us in our match? Don\u2019t accuse us of bullying you guys and refuse to acknowledge your defeat then! Tsch, tsch\u2026\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

Otherwise, you cannot blame us for being rough!\u201d Wu Kui clenched his fists. If it were not for Li Xiangyi who was holding him back, he might actually be fighting Zhang Jun right now.The action earned a low grunt from Zhang Jun.\u201cFine, I\u2019m not wasting more saliva with you guys today either. We\u2019ll solve this on the court!\u201d Zhang Jun made a strange gesture from his nose and tipped his chin away proudly, giving a side-eye to Yun Jian and the team.\u201cRemember what you said, Zhang! Don\u2019t think of escaping when the time comes!\u201d Wu Kui tightened his fists.Actually, Wen Rui, Wu Kui, Li Xiangyi, and the rest of the team comprehended that Zhang Jun was underestimating Yun Jian but no one stood up for her.This was because Yun Jian was their team\u2019s trump card! Only during a critical moment worthwhile to flash their trump card!Hmph, let Zhang Jun have his way, he won\u2019t be so proud for long!\u201cBros, let\u2019s go!\u201d Assuming that his team stood a very high chance of winning because their opponent had Yun Jian as a \u2018burden\u2019, Zhang Jun called out to his boys and the group walked out of the bar smugly.\u201cIgnore them. Bastards, let them feel high and mighty for a few more days!\u201d Wu Kui spat towards where Zhang Jun and boys left.Yun Jian had not made any sound since, quietly watching the teenagers with a smile.Zhang Jun\u2019s appearance did not seem to displease the team players. Quite the opposite, they looked even more fervent now.All of them had witnessed Yun Jian\u2019s skill!She looked puny but she could shoot a hoop some thirty to forty meters way!This was not simply achievable.In addition to being eager for the match, the team was anticipated.Entering the room they booked, their surroundings finally quieted down.Yun Jian sat casually but exuded a deadly charm.Although it was said to be a welcoming party for Yun Jian, it was in fact a simple gathering for the team.To boost the atmosphere, Wen Rui asked a few bottles of finer wine from their server, and considering that girls probably did not know how to drink, he asked for a big bottle of Minute Maid juice for Yun Jian.The beverages were sent briefly. Wen Rui passed the juice to Yun Jian and said, \u201cYou\u2019re a girl. Have this.\u201dYun Jian did not accept the Minute Maid juice. Looking at Wen Rui, she replied with a smile, \u201cSince we\u2019re here to have fun, I can\u2019t be a wet blanket. I can drink.\u201dWhat she did not disclose was that she also had an extremely high alcohol tolerance.Wen Rui was stumped.He had thought that most girls either did not know how to drink or would get drunk after a single sip. That was why he ordered juice for Yun Jian, not guessing that she could drink.Since Yun Jian said so, he poured her a glass instantly.The team watched as Yun Jian smelt the liquid with the wine glass under the tip of her nose and softly muttered, \u201cLafite \u201982.\u201dShe pressed her lips together, then drank the wine. \u201cNot bad.\u201dEveryone on the spot was astounded, even the server who was standing on the side because it really was a 1982 Lafite wine.How did Yun Jian know? Had she identified it just by taking a whiff?You can also listen onLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was as if what she drank was plain water instead of wine.Wen Rui\u2019s drinking ability was a well-known fact by the team but even he had felt a slight discomfort after all the wine; a blush slowly creeping onto his face.Yet Yun Jian looked unaffected.Could she be a heavyweight drinker?Truth be told, Yun Jian was a heavyweight.\u201cCome on, cheers!\u201d Ultimately, the boys nudged each other groggily, a few of them were already knocked out.Li Xiangyi had passed out a long time ago.Wen Rui and Wu Kui were relatively fine; of course, the most sober was Yun Jian.\u201cYou guys! You\u2019re worse than a girl. Wake up, wake up. Cheers! We\u2019re not going home until everyone\u2019s drunk!\u201d Wu Kui was exceptionally excited, clinking his wine glass with those who were close to passing out from being inebriated.\u201cThis is how they are. Don\u2019t be alarmed.\u201d Wen Rui chortled in embarrassment as he sat beside Yun Jian.\u201cMm,\u201d Yun Jian hummed with a nod looking at the youthful teenagers, \u201cIt\u2019s great.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s great to possess such youth like this\u2019 was what she thought.Worried about leaving Qin Yirou alone at home, Yun Jian bid goodbye while it was still early.The gathering was to welcome Yun Jian into the team; now that the main guest was gone, the party ended as well.The boys who were still sober helped the intoxicated ones home respectively.When Yun Jian got home, it was 7 pm in the evening.Qin Yirou was already in bed. The dinner and utensils set on the table appeared to not be touched but it was evident that Qin Yirou had more or less had eaten some.Yun Jian cleaned up the dinnerware and went to bed as well.The next day was Sunday.As the evening\u2019s warm hues colored the sky, Yun Jian went to school for the evening self-study session carrying her bag.She was here early as the classroom was still empty upon arriving. As time passed, more people came.It had been half an hour since Yun Jian got to school when Lu Feiyan came.Once she arrived, she sprinted to Yun Jian without putting down her school bag, muttering, \u201cXiao Jian, Xiao Jian, Lin Mengyu\u2019s discharged from the hospital. I think she\u2019s coming back to school today!\u201dLin Mengyu? Yun Jian frowned.If Lu Feiyan had not mentioned her, she had nearly forgotten who that person was.\u201cOh.\u201d Yun Jian replied and resumed reading her book.\u201cAy, Xiao Jian!\u201d Anxious, Lu Feiyan pushed Yun Jian\u2019s book away and said seriously, \u201cLin Mengyu\u2019s the principal\u2019s daughter. It was Yuan Yingjun, the popular guy, who covered the matter up the last time. Now that Lin Mengyu\u2019s coming back and judging by her character, it\u2019s impossible for her to act as if nothing happened. I\u2019m scared that you\u2019ll\u2026\u201dLu Feiyan grew even more fretful as she spoke.Yun Jian cut her off and placated her. \u201cWhy am I afraid of her when I\u2019m the one who hit her?\u201dYun Jian knew that Lu Feiyan was genuinely concerned for her but just as she spoke, their Chinese class representative, Wang Rourou, walked to her carrying a stack of workbooks and said gloatingly, \u201cYun Jian, the teacher\u2019s asking for you in the office!\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

Yun Jian squinted her eyes.Lu Feiyan was shocked, she clutched her hands on the edge of Yun Jian\u2019s clothes. She was fine but she was afraid for Yun Jian.Yun Jian patted the back of Lu Feiyan\u2019s hand as a sign of mollification before she tossed her book on the desk and stood up.\u201cWhere\u2019s the office?\u201d Yun Jian asked, giving Wang Rourou a glance.Since her rebirth, she had never gone to the teacher\u2019s office.\u201cPff, Yun Jian, have you turned stupid? Or are you scared now? So scared that you\u2019ve even forgotten where the teacher\u2019s office is? There it is! Go quickly.\u201d Wang Rourou said with a smirk, pointing towards the office\u2019s direction whilst looking at Yun Jian in disdain.Yun Jian set off toward where Wang Rourou pointed.\u201cXiao Jian\u2026\u201d Lu Feiyan who stood unmoved twisted her hands together as she watched Yun Jian disappear from her sight.The staff office was also in the classroom building and was not very far from their classroom.After Yun Jian left class and found the office, she walked in with a confident stride.The interior of the office was simple with plenty of teachers working on their own tasks at their tables.Yun Jian went to Madam Jin\u2019s table once she entered as she was her homeroom teacher.Seated currently at Madam Jin\u2019s table was not the teacher herself but Lin Mengyu who was just discharged from the hospital and whom Yun Jian had not seen for a long time.There was a bald middle-aged man who was in his fifties standing beside Lin Mengyu too.Yun Jian had seen this man every Monday when it was a flag-raising day. He must be Lin Mengyu\u2019s father, the principal of Xinjiang Town Junior High School.\u201cHere! She\u2019s here!\u201d Watching as Yun Jian approached, Lin Mengyu pointed at her menacingly, looking like she was going to tear her into pieces.However much Lin Mengyu loved Yuan Yingjun, was equally as much as she hated Yun Jian.She had been resting and healing in the hospital due to her broken rib bone, suffering immensely just to reattach the bones. Furthermore, Yingjun had asked to break up with her when she was hospitalized.This was all because of Yun Jian. If it were not her, would she have ended up like this?\u201cThis is Yun Jian from your class?\u201d Seeing the \u2018culprit\u2019 Yun Jian who made her daughter suffer for some time, Principal Lin with his bulky beer belly sounded fierce when he spoke to Madam Jin.\u201cPrincipal Lin, I think there must be some sort of misunderstanding. I\u2019ve taught Yun Jian from Grade 7 to Grade 9. She\u2019s a good kid and shouldn\u2019t have done something like that to your daughter. Can you give her another chance\u2026\u201dMadam Jin did not speak badly about Yun Jian to pander the principal as she knew of Yun Jian\u2019s past character.In spite of it, Principal Lin was set on vengeance for his daughter today. He did not care about anything, immediately pointing at Yun Jian and told Madam Jin harshly, \u201cA good kid? Would a good kid be involved in a fight? She\u2019s grimly defied our disciplinary rules just for this matter. What\u2019s more, she hurt Mengyu!\u201dThere was a pause before Principal Lin ordered Madam Jin in an undisputable tone, \u201cOur school cannot accommodate a student like this! Ask the girl to leave today and settle her expulsion procedure. Otherwise, you know the consequences, Madam Jin! Hmph!\u201dOf course, Madam Jin knew the consequences. She understood what Principal Lin was saying. If she did not expel Yun Jian today, the one leaving would be her.Yun Jian was indeed a good kid in her view, however; her results were slightly poor but she was always diligent.She honestly did not want a child like this to be forced to drop out of school.You can also listen onLiked it?

As he was going to lash out, Yun Jian cut his turn again.\u201cThat\u2019s because Lin Mengyu beat me up first. If fighting is breaking the school rules and results in expulsion, may I ask Principal Lin if Lin Mengyu should be expelled alongside me?\u201dPrincipal Lin looked appalled while the teachers there were also shocked.They thought that the girl was going to plead for herself but she was actually unafraid of being expelled and was even bold enough to ask for Lin Mengyu to be dismissed with her.Did she not know that Lin Mengyu was Principal Lin\u2019s daughter? How could the principle throw out his own daughter?\u201cBullsh*t, when did I hit you? Look at how well you\u2019re doing right now. Do you look hurt? Yun Jian, have some face!\u201d Lin Mengyu lied without missing a beat and had even twisted the story around.It was no surprise that Principal Lin was biased to his daughter as he instantly agreed. \u201cMengyu is a kind child. It\u2019s impossible that she even lay a finger on you. Something as uncouth as fighting all the more? You are such a young girl, yet you spew nonsense after hitting someone. Shameless. Xinjiang Town Junior High can\u2019t have you as its student!\u201dPrincipal Lin\u2019s underlying words were \u201cScram, go back to where you come from\u201d.Lin Mengyu was a kind child?Yun Jian nearly burst out laughing.The joke was more hilarious than claiming pigs could fly.The teachers in the office sighed unanimously.They were certain about who was right and who was at fault. After all, everyone could see how Lin Mengyu behaved in school.It was just that no one commented, keeping their complaints to themselves, not daring to offend the principal.The teachers were also lamenting Yun Jian\u2019s luck; she could offend anyone but she had chosen the principal\u2019s daughter.Today was her unlucky day!\u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re not being expelled today!\u201d Principal Lin roared with an angry shudder after speaking for long succession.\u201cJust you wait for the expulsion notice!\u201d Principal Lin huffed with a glare at Yun Jian from the corner of his eyes and turned to pick up Lin Mengyu who was seated at Madam Jin\u2019s table to leave.\u201cHey, Principal Lin, calm down. Yun Jian\u2019s still a child. She doesn\u2019t know much and simply just blabbered. Yun Jian, quickly, go apologize to Principal Lin!\u201d Madam Jin panicked when she saw that the principal was leaving, meaning that Yun Jian\u2019s expulsion was certain. She hurriedly pulled the girl and asked her to make an apology, intending to ease the principal\u2019s anger first.Yun Jian let herself be tugged by the teacher.Just when the teachers and Principal Lin, as well as Madam Jin, and Lin Mengyu, all thought that Yun Jian had realized her mistake and was going to ask for forgiveness or apologize, Yun Jian stood in front of Principal Lin and said, \u201cUnit 202, Level 2, 156 Bibo Road, Xinjiang Town.\u201dHuh?

If the cat was out of the bag, his reputation would be gone!Principal Lin looked at Yun Jian to see the girl grinning at him with a huge sense of threat.\u201cDad, ignore Yun Jian. She\u2019s always like saying strange things that don\u2019t make sense. Make her leave quickly. Hmph.\u201d Lin Mengyu urged Principal Lin, thinking Yun Jian was acting foolish just now.She thought that her father who had always spoiled her would reprimand Yun Jian but his next move dropped everyone\u2019s jaw.\u201cMengyu, shut up!\u201d When everyone assumed that Principal Lin would berate Yun Jian, he had instead scolded his daughter, Lin Mengyu.At the receiving end of her father\u2019s reprimand, Lin Mengyu was stunned for a while before she looked at her father in disbelief. \u201cDad, did you - did you shout at me?\u201dHer father had always been the best to her since she was young. No matter how mischievous she was or if she had fought in school, her father was always on her side and had never shouted at her like he did today.The teachers were bewildered at the scene.Why did Yun Jian\u2019s short response cause Principal Lin to chide his daughter when he was incredibly biased standing on her side a few seconds earlier?\u201cDad, I\u2019m your daughter! Why are you scolding me for that bitch Yun Jian? You\u2019ve never done this to me\u2026\u201d Lin Mengyu felt extremely wronged, questioning her father with her finger pointed at Yun Jian, but she was cut off.\u201cSlap!\u201dA resounding slap.Principal Lin had landed a slap on his daughter\u2019s face.Almost instantly, Lin Mengyu\u2019s cheek burned as a bright red mark of a palm appeared.Bearing the pain, Principal Lin smacked his daughter and continued shouting at her, his fat body shaking, \u201cI ask you to shut up, okay!\u201dTo be honest, Principal Lin was still scared of Yun Jian spreading the fact that he had a lover. Not only would he lose face by then, but his job as the principal would also be taken away.That price was too much to pay, so he would absolutely not allow something like this to happen.Yun Jian crossed her arms as she watched the drama develop right before her.She had long expected today, thus she had researched Principal Lin\u2019s personal information on the global secret agent intelligence database when she previously visited the internet caf\u00e9. The outcome was the interesting discovery that she now pinned against him.\u201cAh! Yun Jian! It\u2019s you, it\u2019s all you! I\u2019m going to kill you! I\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201dLin Mengyu was never as humiliated as she was today. Her father had actually slapped her! Absolutely no one had ever treated her like this since she was a small kid!This was all due to Yun Jian!Yuan Yingjun had broken up with her because of Yun Jian as well!Blinded by fury and hatred, Lin Mengyu grabbed a black pen on the table that was the nearest to her and charged at Yun Jian.Lin Mengyu gripped the pen with its tip faced down, about to stab Yun Jian with it.The watching crowd all sucked in a cold breath.Lin Mengyu was going to stab Yun Jian with a pen - this was a life and death situation!\u201cAh!\u201d A few female teachers in the office had already turned away, unable to watch what was going to unfold.There were only a few others who were brave enough to continue watching but their hearts had lurched to their throats too.Just as Lin Mengyu was going to jab the pen into Yun Jian, Yun Jian raised her leg and extended it abruptly.It landed right on Lin Mengyu\u2019s stomach without mercy.Kicking directly on her newly recovered injury, Lin Mengyu flew a few meters away screaming.Yun Jian retracted her leg with a chilling arc.She would kill those who wished her dead first!You can also listen onLiked it?

Therefore, she planned to buy a home computer.Without a question, the computer must not be found by Qin Yirou if it was kept at home.Laptops were already in the market in the year 1998 and could be purchased in bigger cities like Longmen City.What Yun Jian wanted to buy was a laptop as it was portable.The largest mall in Longmen City was Lianmei Shopping Center. One could come here to purchase anything; if you could not find what you wanted here, you would not be able to find it anywhere in Longmen City.The gadget town was at the fourth level of Lianmei Shopping Center. The huge words \u201cLianmei Gadget Town\u201d could be seen on the plate when Yun Jian walked to the floor.Smiling, she stepped in.People rarely bought computers during this era because installing one was costly. Usually, only millionaires would shop here.This was why there was only a female attendant sitting in the gadget town.She was currently swatting flies out of boredom but quickly wore a textbook smile when she heard footsteps, signaling that there was business. Before she even looked up to see who the customer was, her overly sweet voice rang, \u201cWelcome -\u201dShe paused.The female attendant had thought that her customer was definitely a successful person in their forties or fifties, or a middle-aged man who was dressed like a boss, not expecting a teenage girl to walk in.The breath of air that she took in anticipation deflated immediately when she saw Yun Jian stepping in.How could a teenager have the money to buy a computer? She probably had never even touched one.The computers here cost more than tens of thousands!Making assumptions from the appearance of Yun Jian\u2019s outfit, the female attendant instantly concluded that she was most probably a pauper who was here to look at computers yet could not afford them.She sat back down right away.Yun Jian had obviously noticed the female attendant\u2019s attitude but she did not mind her, walking straight to the laptop display counter.Watching as Yun Jian almost touched the laptop, the female attendant finally could not hold herself back.\u201cHey, hey, hey. Ay! Don\u2019t touch it!\u201d She ran over wanting to swat Yun Jian\u2019s hand away, saying, \u201cThis laptop is the newest model. It costs more than thirty thousand. Don\u2019t you touch it. Can you pay for the loss if you break it?\u201dWhat she meant was \u201cWhy are you here touching the laptop when you should be studying in school. Can you pay for the loss if you break it?\u201d.You can also listen onLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We don\u2019t sell toys you like, we sell computers! Computers, you know? Something you can surf the internet with! Ay, never mind, you won\u2019t know what I\u2019m saying anyway. Go along your way now!\u201dThe female attendant had always been proud of her job selling computers at the gadget town.She even thought she was superior to others as her customers here were entrepreneurs and bosses; some people don\u2019t even know what a computer was or had ever seen one.She instinctively categorized Yun Jian to that group of people, her tone proud when she spoke.She was thinking that she was nothing in front of personages but she could at least seek some sense of superiority from a little girl.Yun Jian was amused, wondering where the female attendant\u2019s sense of supremacy came from.\u201cThis is the newest laptop, ThinkPad 600, 13.3inch. Maximum RAM support 64/320MB, 5GB hard disk, and weighs 2.5kg. I\u2019m not wrong, am I, miss?\u201dYun Jian disregarded the female attendant\u2019s babbling and recited the laptop\u2019s specifications in a breath.Since the female attendant said that she did not know what a computer was, she gave her an account of the laptop\u2019s specifications.Presuming that Yun Jian was a little girl who knew nothing, the female attendant\u2019s eyes widened when she could memorize the specifications. Why did it feel like she was showing off in front of an expert just now?Furthermore, the female attendant did not even comprehend what Yun Jian was saying. She only knew to sell computers - how could she know about the specifications of computers or laptops?\u201cTha - that\u2019s right\u2026\u201d To save herself from humiliation the female attendant had expressed her fake acknowledgment.\u201cI want it. Pack the laptop for me.\u201d Yun Jian\u2019s index and middle finger tapped the glass counter twice while her other hand went into her pocket to retrieve the bankcard that stored nearly one hundred million US dollars, tossing it to the counter.That amount of money was in Qin Yirou\u2019s bankcard at first but Yin Jian had later signed up for a bankcard herself and transferred the money.This bankcard belonged to her, Yun Jian.\u201cThis - uh\u2026\u201d The female attendant was baffled once more.She had thought that Yun Jian was the type of kid who was just poor but came here to look around.She was actually here to buy a computer? - And she used a bankcard?The female attendant wondered if there was really money inside the card.\u201cThe laptop\u2019s price is set at 31999 Chinese yuan. Is the money in this card\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough\u201d did not roll out of the female attendant\u2019s tongue fast enough as Yun Jian cut her short.\u201cThere\u2019s no password set. Please return it to me at once after you swipe it,\u201d Yun Jian stated, not entertaining the female attendant\u2019s quip.Up to this point, the female attendant could only pick up the card and go to the cashier.She was eager to find out if a little girl\u2019s card could really pay thirty thousand Chinese yuan. It was not a small sum, after all.She only earned two to three thousand Chinese yuan a month working here and a monthly wage like this was relatively high during this period of time!Reaching the cashier, the female attendant was not in a hurry to swipe the payment. Perhaps it was her curiosity. She wanted to find out how much this assertive girl had in her bankcard.As the card was not protected by a password, she checked the balance first.When the digits popped up signifying the card\u2019s balance, the female attendant nearly dropped the card from her shock.The number printed on the screen was 99,970,000.There were two blinding words behind the digits too, \u201cUS dollars\u201d!It was 99,970,000 US dollars!You can also listen onLiked it?

That was equivalent to six hundred million Chinese yuan!The female attendant grasped the card shakily, nearly choking herself.God knew how overwhelmed she was when she saw the digits.What did it mean when a teenage girl possessed such a huge amount of money?This girl was absolutely no ordinary person!One was already notable with a net worth over one million in Longmen City and the female attendant was usually servile whenever millionaires like this came by.Yet this girl\u2026The female attendant dared not allow her imagination to go wild. She quickly swiped the laptop\u2019s cost from the bankcard and ran to where Yun Jian was.When she passed the card back to Yun Jian, her hands trembled.\u201cYour - your card. Please keep it safe\u2026\u201d The female attendant\u2019s attitude took a 180 degree change. She stuttered in her speech and swiftly ran to wrap the laptop that Yun Jian had bought.She was so close to missing such valuable business because of her conceitedness. It was lucky that Yun Jian did not look like she minded.The change in the female attendant\u2019s attitude was evident to Yun Jian but she was not fazed.Accepting the bag that contained her laptop, Yun Jian turned to leave.\u201cHave - have a good day!\u201d The female attendant bowed deeply but did not receive any response.Exiting the gadget town, Yun Jian went to sign up for a network cable. It was futile to have bought a laptop without having internet.When she was done, it was already noon by the time she stepped out of Lianmei Shopping Center.There was no one home. Qin Yirou had gone to work and would only return at night. Consequently, Yun Jian had her lunch at a noodle house in Longmen City before she went back to Xinjiang Town.Once she got home, she set up the broadband and went back to her room to switch on the laptop.Her fingers danced across the keyboard, opening up a new webpage.The webpage was used to contact her subordinates in her past life. She did not log on to it in the internet caf\u00e9 that day because of its inconvenient operation in public.Yun Jian logged on with her previous life\u2019s moniker, \u201cSlaying God\u201d.Just as the webpage loaded, a rapid beep rang.A small window popped out - a private message from her subordinate, Alluring Demon.\u201cSlaying, you heisted one hundred million US dollars from the company, didn\u2019t you? You\u2019re short of money?\u201d The message that Alluring Demon left exuded disbelief.The Slaying God certainly was not short of any fund but too bad she was Yun Jian now.Yun Jian beamed and swiftly typed. \u201cYup.\u201dClick. sent.The reply from Alluring Demon was immediate.\u201cGive me your card number. I\u2019ll transfer a few billion to you.\u201d Her reply was short and sweet.A few billion was nothing in her eyes.\u201cNo need. I don\u2019t need it now.\u201d Yun Jian replied.Truthfully, what she did not lack the most in her previous life was money. A few hundred million was an insignificant number to her.Reborn, however, she realized that a few hundred million was already an astronomical figure for ordinary people.Most of them would never possess such a large sum of money all their life.After replying to Alluring Demon, Yun Jian flipped her laptop close and lay on the bed with her eyes closed in contemplation.You can also listen onLiked it?

She was granted the exception.After all, no one would object, Yun Jian\u2019s skill spoke for her.\u201cXiao Jian, our evening self-study session today is canceled! It\u2019s said that we\u2019re having a class activity tonight and we\u2019re asked to go up on stage to perform! Our homeroom teacher agreed too, saying that we can relax and recalibrate our study motivation!\u201dLu Feiyan had attached herself to Yun Jian\u2019s ear once the art lesson ended in the afternoon, beyond excited.Year after year, they have finally reached the ninth grade, about to face the first ever crucial exam in their life, the high school entrance exam.The students could hardly write in the correct state of mind or study properly under such pressure.Consequently, the class committee had a meeting and appealed for special permission from their homeroom teacher to organize something to boost the class\u2019 morale using one evening self-study session.The classmates were overjoyed when they heard that there was no evening self-study session in addition to having an event. Lu Feiyan was the same.That was why she had sprinted to Yun Jian to tell her the news once class was over.\u201cOh.\u201d Yun Jian was not really interested, going for a nap on her desk instead.\u201cAy, ay, Xiao Jian, don\u2019t look so indifferent. There\u2019s hardly an event and once this event is over, we won\u2019t have time to play anymore. We\u2019ll have to study hard after this. You should be happier!\u201d Lu Feiyan said with a pout.She seemed to recall something and continued talking to Yun Jian, \u201cOh yeah, Xiao Jian, the registration for the evening performance is still open. I\u2019ve put my name in, I can sing to make everyone feel a bit merrier. Do you want to do it with me?\u201d\u201cNah.\u201d It was only then that Yun Jian looked up at Lu Feiyan with a smile pressing her lips together.\u201cOh, okay then.\u201d Lu Feiyan did not press her further.\u2026The time for the evening self-study session came.Anyone in class could go up on stage and perform by registering their name with the class committee as the purpose of the event was none other than to ease the tension engulfing everyone.A song or a dance, anything was welcomed.The activity was actually Chinese class representative Wang Rourou\u2019s initiative. As a matter of fact, she was fully in charge of emceeing the event.It was previously clear to see that Wang Rourou loved being in the limelight or else she would not have gossiped about Yun Jian right in front of the entire class.The atmosphere was indeed lively during the event. Lu Feiyan had gone up on stage and sang too, her sweet voice earned an applause from the whole class.Yun Jian clapped for Lu Feiyan as well, watching her from her seat.After Lu Feiyan exited the stage, Wang Rourou suddenly peeked at Yun Jian with an internal scoff, seemingly up to no good, while holding the list of her classmates\u2019 turns in performing.\u201cThe next one\u2019s Yun Jian. She\u2019s going to dance for us. Let\u2019s give her a round of applause!\u201d Wang Rourou announced and looked spitefully at Yun Jian.Undoubtedly, Wang Rourou held a grudge. She had added Yun Jian\u2019s name to the performing list remembering that Yun Jian had blatantly ignored her the last time.Wang Rourou knew about Yun Jian\u2019s background as well.How could she have learned dancing when she came from the village?Hmph. She had already written her name. Yun Jian must dance even if she did not want to!An eerie grin stretched on Wang Rourou\u2019s face.She was anticipating Yun Jian\u2019s mortification. It was her fault that she made the situation awkward for her the other day.This was what the poor deserved. This was Yun Jian\u2019s fault.You can also listen onLiked it?

Reasonably, it was not formal like a new year concert. The students had gone on stage to sing or dance with the sole intention of having fun, really \u201cthe more the merrier\u201d.That was why Wang Rourou had long written Yun Jian\u2019s name on the performer\u2019s name list. Even if Yun Jian said that she did not sign up for it now, the classmates would then think that she was being a wet blanket.With this premise considered, and Wang Rourou\u2019s certainty that Yun Jian came from a farming background. Requesting her to dance was simply impossible. She probably had never seen what an actual dance looks like.It was obvious that she wanted to embarrass Yun Jian.As expected, the entire class clapped exceptionally loud after Wang Rourou\u2019s announcement.The students would never refuse any sort of drama. Most of them were not stupid. They could actually discern that Wang Rourou was putting Yun Jian in a tough spot.It was just that, free shows were hard to refuse. Therefore, they cheered Yun Jian on to dance.\u201cWang Rourou, what are you trying to do? Xiao Jian didn\u2019t even sign up. Why are you asking her to dance on the stage? You\u2019re being intentionally deceitful!\u201d There was only Lu Feiyan who stood up against Wang Rourou among the audience; she was upset, her gaze daggered at Wang Rourou when she spoke out for Yun Jian.She had been on Xiao Jian\u2019s side all this while. How could she not know if Yun Jian had volunteered for a performance, especially a dance?Lu Feiyan had asked Yun Jian to sing with her but the latter did not accept the invitation.It was apparent that Wang Rourou was avenging her personal agenda and purposely added Yun Jian to the list, asking her to dance!The majority of the people knew how to sing. Worse comes to worst, one could sing the national anthem. Most of them, however, did not know how to dance.It was an undisguised bully! Lu Feiyan was the first to jump.\u201cWhat do you mean what am I trying to do? I\u2019m announcing the name according to the name list! Would I have added Yun Jian\u2019s name on my own? I don\u2019t dabble in cheap tricks like you guys!\u201d Wang Rourou denied despite succeeding in her little scheme.She suddenly made an exaggerated expression of surprise, as if she had discovered a new continent, and asked rhetorically in a raised voice looking at Yun Jian, \u201cOh gosh, do you not know how to dance, Yun Jian? Then why did you sign up for dancing? Since you\u2019ve done so, you got to come up on stage and perform. Why don\u2019t you come up and do some twirls? Our event today is only to liven things up anyway, it\u2019s okay\u2026\u201dIf one did not know better, Wang Rourou might seem nice and caring to her peers.Yun Jian was amused.\u201cYou really want me to dance?\u201d Yun Jian spoke airily looking at Wang Rourou before Lu Feiyan could stop her, as she stood up lazily from her seat.\u201cYeah, what else? But it\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t know how to dance, Yun Jian. Just do it for fun and for everyone\u2019s enjoyment. We\u2019re all classmates, there\u2019s nothing to be shy about!\u201d Wang Rourou tried to sound as gentle as she could, already over the moon inwardly; she could not wait to see Yun Jian embarrass herself.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right. No biggie, go up and dance!\u201d\u201cUh-huh!\u201d\u2026More classmates began to echo Wang Rourou\u2019s request and the latter wore a victorious grin.Hmph, there was no way Yun Jian could go against her!Watching the crowd, Yun Jian smirked. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll dance!\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

She knew that Wang Rourou was setting her friend up but she was unable to stop her.\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Yun Jian gave Lu Feiyan a smile, acknowledging that she was genuinely concerned for her.To survive in this world, one did not need a large circle of friends. As long as there was that one who was sincere and truly cared for her, having just one friend like her was enough.Every time she heard Yun Jian respond \u201cit\u2019s okay\u201d when they encountered sticky situations, Lu Feiyan felt that she would always be reassured.Deep in her heart she believed in Xiao Jian and was faithful that she could do it.\u201cYun Jian, hop on quickly if you\u2019re going to dance. The whole class is waiting for you!\u201d Wang Rourou added, already restlessly eager.She was impatient to see Yun Jian embarrass herself.

Her expression was beyond exaggerated.She had initially planned for Yun Jian to make a fool out of herself in front of the class, yet she was now requesting to dance outside of their classroom?The outdoors were lit at night. Did that not mean that the other classes that were having evening self-study sessions could also see Yun Jian embarrassing herself?Is she not giving herself a hard slap on the face?Wang Rourou\u2019s grin oddly widened as she spoke up in a hurry. She was afraid that Yun Jian would go back on her word, choosing to only dance in the classroom, \u201cOkay, okay. Great. Go outside and dance. We\u2019ll watch you from the corridor!\u201dThe whole class moved to the corridor outside immediately.The students watched Yun Jian walk out in anticipation. They wondered what she was going to do.Could it be that she wanted to let the whole school know that she could not dance?The surrounding classrooms were all ninth graders. Now that everyone in Class (6) had gone out, the other classes noticed the commotion as well.This included Yuan Yingjun who was in the first class, Li Xiangyi, as well as the others from the basketball team. All of them could clearly see Yun Jian walking from her class to the spacious lawn outside.What was happening? What was Yun Jian going to do?Exiting the classroom, Yun Jian\u2019s stride was laidback with both her hands in her pockets, she gave off a refreshing vibe.Right in the center, opposite of Class (6), was a lawn that had a variety of gym equipment. As Yun Jian moved toward the destination, she suddenly stood beside a long pole that was available in the sports facilities.The pole was a few meters tall.\u201cHey, what\u2019s she doing? Is she going to dance with that pole? Huh? Haha!\u201d A boy in their class could not help being sarcastic.Nonetheless, Yun Jian stretched out her hand as her fingers landed softly on the pole.Her aura transformed instantly.Yun Jian\u2019s laidback demeanor turned alluring all of a sudden. She walked over and leaned herself against the pole, casting her gaze to where everyone else with equal sensuality.This was only the beginning of Yun Jian\u2019s dance.While everyone was still bewildered, she sprang and hung herself onto the pole swiftly.What puzzled her audience was seemingly how relaxed she was the moment she was on the pole.It\u2019s pole dancing!Some students were immediately aware of what Yun Jian was going to do next.She actually knew how to pole dance?

She had not realized yet what Yun Jian was going to do and could not help mocking her once again.Then, a scene that baffled her unfolded.Yun Jian had one hand gripped on the pole while her legs wrapped onto it as she began to spin around.Each and every one of her movements was alluring and bewitching, yet accompanied the tempo of her dance, it had a classical feel.There was no music playing in the background, despite that Yun Jian\u2019s pole dancing captivated everyone.Lifting her legs, arching her back, creating leg splits, she executed each move with perfection.Other than watching with widened eyes, Wang Rourou was unable to say a word.She had wanted to mortify Yun Jian, but even a fool could see that Yun Jian could not have achieved such finesse in dancing without years of practice.Yun Jian actually knew how to pole dance? Yuan Yingjun from the first class was stunned.Everyone had always known that Yun Jian was pretty. However, she usually wore loose ordinary clothes that concealed her figure.There was a sense of strength within the gracefulness of her pole dancing, especially when she landed various poses. Her loose fitting clothes clung to her body, outlining her marvelous shape and her impeccably slim figure.\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s beautiful!\u201dA boy exclaimed from the crowd.The atmosphere hit its peak at this point in time.Right until the end of the performance, the audience was still immersed in the fervent emotion, unable to break themselves out of their trance.Yun Jian landed easily and tugged a smile at Wang Rourou.The latter\u2019s emotions could no longer be described as just shocked. Her expression looked glummer than one who had eaten a frog.Yun Jian reeled in her gaze and returned to the classroom.As a secret agent in her past life, pole dancing was a genre of dance that she was obligated to learn. In spite of it, she was able to master the dance and exude a different type of vibe.It was just that she did not expect tonight\u2019s performance to be in front of everyone.Yun Jian went to Wang Rourou and chuckled. \u201cI\u2019ve completed my dance.\u201dWithout waiting for a reply, she headed back to the classroom.\u201cHey, Xiao Jian!\u201d Before she could make it into the classroom, she was stopped by Yuan Yingjun who had run out from Class (1).Yun Jian could recognize his voice right away.\u201cXiao Jian, have you forgiven me? Is that why you\u2019ve danced outside, was it specifically for me?\u201d Yuan Yingjun had fled from embarrassment the last time but he was still determined.He did not think that Yun Jian would actually dislike him, merely believing she previously was just throwing a tantrum.After all, she could not find another boy who was as amazing as he was in the entire Xinjiang Town, could she?Moreover, why did Yun Jian dance outside where he could see if it were not for this reason?Yun Jian was close to bursting out in laughter when she heard Yuan Yingjun\u2019s words.She had never met someone as shameless as him.She had made herself clear countless times, yet Yuan Yingjun was persistent.What could she do? When the original Yun Jian was still alive, Yuan Yingjun was already unrelenting, despite still being together with Lin Mengyu. He was like a gum stuck under one\u2019s shoes.Yuan Yingjun was utterly shameless huh?Yun Jian chortled and said, \u201cWe\u2019re not close. What\u2019s there to forgive?

Together, the two went back to their class, leaving behind a group of stupefied audience members.It was obvious that there would be two rumors spreading around the school not too long after.The first one would be gossip that had made rounds earlier, the most popular guy in school courting Yun Jian only to be rejected. Yuan Yingjun had confessed to Yun Jian once again, this time in front of everyone but was rejected once more.The most popular guy being rejected twice by Yun Jian - this would elicit laments from a lot of people.The second one was Yun Jian\u2019s pole dancing.For both matters, Yun Jian was the center of attention, but now having gone back to the classroom, the limelight herself had her eyes closed resting her head on her desk.She was sleeping.Yun Jian could feel her interest dwindling. She was no longer as excited from everything around her like she had been the first few days.The students standing by the doors had all gone back to their classrooms to continue with their activities tonight.Yuan Yingjun who failed to woo Yun Jian returned to his classroom as well. It was still an evening self-study session after all. Before he left, he glanced to where Yun Jian was.A dark conspiracy was forming in his mind.Since Yun Jian was so headstrong, then he would\u2026\u2026Wang Rourou\u2019s plan to humiliate Yun Jian backfired and had made the latter shine brighter instead. She was agitated, but there was nothing she could do except to continue emceeing the performances.As time passed, it had been slightly more than a month since Yun Jian\u2019s rebirth brought her here. The school was about to hold its monthly test soon.The next week would be the basketball match. Li Xiangyi and the team had begun to train harder for the competition and needed Yun Jian\u2019s guidance occasionally.Of course, Yun Jian did not refuse them.After a leisurely month, she knew that she must not go on like this.She had yet to avenge her younger brother\u2019s death in her previous life. How could she live in such relaxation?On this night, Yun Jian logged on to the website that she used to contact her subordinates and connected to Gu Sha Mercenaries. It was not Tiger.Leopard whom she went to this time, but another manager of the mercenary with the moniker Snake.Lizard.She gave Snake.Lizard a long address and a simple order. \u201cCome as soon as you can.\u201dThe address was her current residency but she did not specify Xinjiang Town.Yun Jian had asked Snake.Lizard to wait for her in a posh hotel in Longmen City.Among the Gu Sha Mercenaries, Yun Jian had the highest hopes for Snake.Lizard. The latter was her most capable assistant in her previous life.The organization that had killed her younger brother must be extraordinary. Yun Jian knew that she had to devise a comprehensive plan and the only person she trusted now was Snake.Lizard. That was why she had asked her to come alone.Snake.Lizard was just a moniker, however, her actual personality was like her moniker. She was a venomous woman, being a poisons expert.Right after the message was sent, there was a reply ten minutes later. \u201cI\u2019ll come over immediately after I\u2019m done with my current task.\u201dThe reason Yun Jian in her past life could top the secret agent ranking and even secure her position as the chief of the world\u2019s premier Gu Sha Mercenaries, was due to the many capable talents around her.Nonetheless, in order to lead her underlings, she was an outstanding talent herself!\u201cXiao Jian, why is your room still lit? Aren\u2019t you sleeping yet? It\u2019s nearly ten now, you still have school tomorrow.\u201d Qin Yirou\u2019s gentle reminder came from outside of the door.Qin Yirou had always slept earlier than Yun Jian. After waking up to go to the toilet and realizing that the girl\u2019s room was still brightly lit, so she had come to remind her.\u201cI\u2019m about to sleep,\u201d Yun Jian replied.She then shut her laptop and hid it, before getting off her bed barefooted to turn the lights off.Her laptop was bought without Qin Yirou\u2019s knowledge. Of course, she must not let the woman find out about it.The night slipped past peacefully.You can also listen onLiked it?

She was heading home to pick up her school bag when she saw a weeping Qin Yirou and a few people sitting beside her once she entered her house.She saw her uncle that she previously met, Yun Zheng.There were two elders sitting beside him.They were no outsiders, they were her grandparents.Whether it was Qin Yirou, Yun Zheng, grandfather Yun Zhong or grandmother Lu Lanhua, no one looked cheery.\u201cWhat do you mean divorce? You\u2019re married into the Yun Family, you\u2019re a member of Yun for life. Isn\u2019t it good to spend the rest of your days peacefully with Gang? He\u2019s made a few little mistakes now, but you should accommodate him. It\u2019s just borrowing money from the loan sharks. Besides, which man doesn\u2019t cheat? Don\u2019t you try and act miserable. No way you can divorce Gang!\u201d Grandmother Lu Lanhua who wore brightly patterned clothes blabbered while pointing at Qin Yirou.\u201cMom, this doesn\u2019t make sense. It\u2019s Gang who\u2019s wrong\u2026\u201d Unable to take it, Yun Zheng stepped out to speak for his sister-in-law.His sister-in-law, Qin Yirou, was adamant about the divorce but when his parents heard about it, they rushed over at once and rebuked her without understanding the situation.There was only one goal from them, that was to stop Qin Yirou and Yun Gang\u2019s divorce!As Yun Gang was not around, it was difficult to make the decision.Yun Zheng understood that it was his younger brother who was at fault. That was why he wanted to help Qin Yirou.In spite of it, once he spoke up, Lu Lanhua was further angered and reprimanded the man as well.\u201cOh wow, why are you helping an outsider now, Zheng? I won\u2019t agree anyway! Unless I\u2019m dead!\u201d Lu Lanhua was overbearing and being unreasonable.How could she agree to Qin Yirou divorcing her son, Yun Gang?Her son had lived an easy life all these years because Qin Yirou had toiled hard to feed the family!If both of them were to divorce, she might have to take care of her good-for-nothing son in addition to not receiving any benefit!The old woman must keep Qin Yirou around as a laborer regardless.Grandfather Yun Zhong did not say anything. Instead, he took puffs from his tobacco pipe with a serious look.With how imperious Lu Lanhua was being, Qin Yirou could only weep. She did not have the courage to defy an elder.In addition, Yun Jian\u2019s grandmother, Lu Lanhua was infamously shrewish and spiteful in the town. She was exceptionally sharp-tongued and absurd.Never in this world would Qin Yirou be able to fight Lu Lanhua.\u201cYou can die then.\u201d Yun Jian who heard Lu Lanhua\u2019s death threat by the door said with a flat tone, as she walked in calmly despite her alarming words.Qin Yirou had suffered enough through the years she was married to Yun Gang.Now that the man had even borrowed from loan sharks, ran away, cheated, and caused his kept mistress to come and harass her, it marked the end of their marriage.Furthermore, no one knew where Yun Gang had fled to now.Yun Jian\u2019s sudden appearance surprised the group.Her reply to Lu Lanhua, asking her to just die stunned them.Yun Jian had always been a docile child.

Patriarchy-BiasedPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euWhile everyone was caught off guard, Yun Jian had already come to Qin Yirou\u2019s side.She recalled impressions of grandmother Lu Lanhua from the original owner\u2019s memory. She was truculent and absurd, mostly unreasonable.In the past, Qin Yirou had frequently been at the receiving end of her anger.Qin Yirou\u2019s character disallowed her from challenging her elders, so she had always been bullied.\u201cYou - did you ask me to die? Great, you don\u2019t even care that I\u2019m your grandma now! Unfilial girl! What has this world come to be!\u201d Lu Lanhua was the first to react. She looked choked as she pointed at Yun Jian and spat in spite.Lu Lanhua was an old biased woman who valued sons over daughters.If it had been Yun Yi who stood here today speaking like this to her, she would never retort with the same tone that she just did.It was unfortunate that Yun Jian was a girl. Thus, she was a sore thumb in Lu Lanhua\u2019s eyes.That was the difference between being a granddaughter and a grandson!\u201cDidn\u2019t you say it yourself? My mom wants to divorce Yun Gang and you won\u2019t agree unless you\u2019re dead?\u201d Yun Jian narrowed her eyes, her long eyelashes batted.The rest of the family was jolted.Lu Lanhua had indeed said so just now, but all of them knew that she was just rambling out of rage to threaten Qin Yirou. How could she actually dare to kill herself?Yun Jian took her words seriously, however, as she looked at her so-called grandmother coldly and enunciated each of her words clearly, \u201cSince you don\u2019t agree, you can die. My mom won\u2019t be living the rest of her life with Yun Gang. The divorce is imminent!\u201dYun Jian had directly addressed Yun Gang by his name. It was evident that she truly did not see him as her father anymore.A father like him was not a father at all!\u201cWhether your mother divorces or not isn\u2019t up to a petulant kid like you to interfere!\u201d Lu Lanhua panted harshly as she was infuriated.Finally, she gritted her teeth before shouting at both Yun Jian and Qin Yirou, \u201cFine! Divorce! But the two of you must leave the house with nothing! You\u2019re not allowed to leave with any single item in this house! And Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi has to come with us!\u201dTo Lu Lanhua, this house and her grandson, Yun Yi, were the most crucial assets.In other words, if the family\u2019s money-making machine, Qin Yirou, could not be retained, she could get lost with Yun Jian. - However, Yun Yi was her grandson and he must stay!Yun Jian chuckled with a demeaning smirk.If she had remembered correctly, it was all with Qin Yirou\u2019s hard-earned money that the house could be renovated into two stories. The blood, sweat, and tears that Qin Yirou had put in for this home throughout the years could never be summarized by a word or two.Now that Lu Lanhua wanted them to leave with nothing, it was just flagrant bullying!Yun Jian was about to counter when Qin Yirou spoke for herself this time.\u201cMa! This is the last time I call you Ma because you\u2019re a mother too. You know how a mother feels!\u201d Qin Yirou breathed in and wiped away her tears to continue saying, \u201cI\u2019m fine with not taking anything in this house but Xiao Yi must leave with me!\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Lu Lanhua growled right after Qin Yirou finished.That was her grandson!Lu Lanhua had only two sons, Yun Zheng and Yun Gang.Her eldest son, Yun Zheng, only had a daughter, Yun Xiaoya; while her youngest son, Yun Gang, had a son!She only had one grandson.

Once she thought about Lu Lanhua wanting to take her son away, Qin Yirou was furious despite her mild temper.She was a mother. She could leave all her hard-earned money behind, but never her children.\u201cThis house can go to you, I won\u2019t fight for it, but Xiao Yi and Xiao Jian are both my children. I\u2019ll leave with them!\u201dSomehow, Yun Jian had been holding Qin Yirou\u2019s hand. This gave her courage despite her being on the edge of despair. For the first time, she countered Lu Lanhua with deep rage.No matter how meek she was, she still had a temper.Qin Yirou really could not take it anymore.Her husband left her nothing but debt and troubles from his affair. Now that she wanted a divorce, she had a ridiculous mother-in-law who forbade it.She could still hold out, only until the woman wanted her child too. How could she put up with this?\u201cGood, good. Rebelling now, are you\u2026\u201dThis was Qin Yirou\u2019s first time defying Lu Lanhua. The latter was dumbstruck for several seconds before she could react. Extending her hand while she cussed at her, she wanted to give Qin Yirou a slap.Before her palm landed on Qin Yirou\u2019s cheek, a dainty hand caught Lu Lanhua\u2019s old and wrinkled palm.\u201cSlap!\u201dYun Jian had instead given Lu Lanhua a slap first.The surrounding was quiet. The slap was resounding.It stunned everyone in the house.Lu Lanhua was still an elder no matter how unreasonable she was. No one there had ever thought that Yun Jian would just slap her like that.A granddaughter slapping her grandmother?As everyone watched in surprise, Yun Jian chuckled eerily. \u201cTry and hit my mom! I promise that you\u2019ll come out of here on a stretcher!\u201dOne must not say that Yun Jian was being disrespectful or that she had stepped over the line.Yun Jian admitted that she was no benevolent person.She was protective over her own kind and she was very selfless.She would never yield to anyone who bullied her mother! - Her so-called grandmother included.Lu Lanhua who just received a hard slap held her cheek and stared at Yun Jian in disbelief.Yun Jian had always been meek and timid. Even when she had said something brazen just now, everyone had still thought that she had only the courage to talk back, but nothing more.Nevertheless, what had she done just now?The cowardly granddaughter had just slapped her?Lu Lanhua was not a good-tempered person. She was, after all, infamous in town for being shrewish.She was best at arguing and being outrageously obstinate.Slapped by her granddaughter today, it was now impossible for her to relent.\u201cGreat! Snappy now, aren\u2019t you? How dare you hit your actual grandma? Have you really taken me as an old lady - think that I\u2019m so old, I can\u2019t beat you up anymore huh? We\u2019re not done today if I don\u2019t teach you a lesson on behalf of your unmannerly mother!\u201d Lu Lanhua rolled her sleeves up as she spat and walked toward Yun Jian huffing in rage.\u201cMom, calm down. Don\u2019t get angry. We can talk this through\u2026\u201d Yun Zheng quickly pulled Lu Lanhua\u2019s arm to stop her.Hah.Yun Jian wore a smirk when she heard what Lu Lanhua said. Could she actually be afraid of her?\u201cEnough!\u201d Grandfather Yun Zhong who had been quietly standing on the side landed a harsh slap on the table and bellowed.It silenced Lu Lanhua at once.It seemed that Old Sir Yun was still reverent, to Lu Lanhua, at least.Plagued by the family plight, Yun Zhong looked like he had aged a decade momentously. He sighed at Qin Yirou as if he had withered from making a significant decision, \u201cAih, divorce. Get a divorce. Take both children with you.

His initial goal was similar to Lu Lanhua\u2019s, to dissuade the divorce.It was just that his attitude was not as harsh as Lu Lanhua\u2019s.However, he had turned to another decision just now.His youngest daughter-in-law had suffered having been married to his unfilial son. There was never a good day in her years of marriage. It had been filled with hardships.Yun Zhong felt sorry for Qin Yirou. She was someone else\u2019s wonderful daughter too, but her life had taken a turn for the worse after marrying Yun Gang. Yun Zhong compromised and ultimately chose to let go.His words shocked everyone.Qin Yirou did not expect him to be the one on her side, as when there was a discord he usually kept to himself.Warmth flooded her heart. She had decided then and there that she would come back to visit the old man when she had settled down with her children after this.\u201cWhat? I don\u2019t agree! I won\u2019t let her take away my grandson no matter what!\u201d Lu Lanhua was vehement, glaring at Qin Yirou and Yun Jian.\u201cShut up, old hag! We\u2019ve owed Yirou too much. Do you want my conscience to be guilty for the rest of my life!\u201d Yun Zhong slapped the table hard several times as he spoke whilst growling at Lu Lanhua. He was close to slapping his palm on her face instead.Lu Lanhua was still intimidated by the old man\u2019s rage. She was furious but she could only clamp her mouth shut.Yun Zhong panted and soothed his tone as much as he could, before looking at Qin Yirou and Yun Jian with a sigh. \u201cYirou, go complete the divorce procedure whenever that unfilial son, Yun Gang, is back. Stay here in this house first. Ah\u2026 he\u2019s had it coming! He\u2019s been asking for this\u2026\u201dSighing while he spoke, Yun Zhong walked out slowly dragging his leaden body. He was going home.Just as he stepped out of the house, Lu Lanhua turned with a glowering stare at Qin Yirou. \u201cGet lost as soon as possible since you\u2019re leaving anyway! This house is my Gang\u2019s property!\u201dShe then glared daggers at Yun Jian before leaving after Yun Zhong.Yun Zheng was in the trickiest position. Not knowing what to say, he could only smile helplessly before he left.Qin Yirou and Yun Jian who were still high-strung were all who remained.\u201cMom.\u201d Seeing that the \u2018family\u2019 was gone, Yun Jian gently tapped Qin Yirou\u2019s shoulder and rubbed back her in pacification.\u201cMom, we\u2019ve braved harder days. As long as you, bro, and I, the three of us are all still together, there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t go through.\u201d Yun Jian took Qin Yirou into her embrace and comforted her softly.The woman did not make a sound but Yun Jian could feel her tears wetting her shoulder.As long as they were together, there was nothing they could not overcome.Yun Jian planned to fully move out of Xinjiang Town and relocate the entire family to Longmen City given this opportunity.Certainly, the plan was close to its execution.\u2026Monday and Tuesday of the next week were the monthly school tests, while the basketball match was on Friday morning.As the monthly test was approaching, many students pulled long faces.If they failed to perform well, their parents would be after them when the results were announced. Therefore, all of them pulled their socks up and started to cram.\u201cXiao Jian, how\u2019s your preparation?\u201d Lu Feiyan looked at Yun Jian glumly with slight nervousness as the test was coming soon.\u201cNo problem,\u201d replied Yun Jian.She could ace it without preparation too. After all, the level of this test was a piece of cake for her.In spite of it, everyone knew that Yun Jian\u2019s results had always ranked at the bottom few places of the class. Each time there was an examination, she was usually the most mournful.Her \u201cno problem\u201d, therefore attracted attention.It was coincidentally heard by Wang Rourou as well. The girl was still begrudged about the dance. Once she heard that Yun Jian had \u201cno problem\u201d studying, she could not help coming over to taunt her.\u201cHey, Yun Jian, how much do you plan to score this time? You ought to study hard.

If you\u2019re so smart, score as high as I will!\u201dYun Jian had already known that the original body\u2019s owner had terrible results, already ranking last in the class and sometimes, even being the worst in the whole school.Wang Rourou\u2019s results were not the best, however, she was among the top ten in class.She taunted her because she was so confident and reassured that Yun Jian would not be able to catch up to her grades.\u201cYou can anticipate it then. Now, please move away because you\u2019re an eyesore,\u201d Yun Jian said while squinting far off into the distance.Wang Rourou stomped away angrily, thinking that Yun Jian will go cry at a corner when the monthly test results were released.Yun Jian finally regained her peace after the girl left.The examination began soon.Yun Jian was not in a hurry to write once she had gotten the papers.Ten minutes was all she took to complete each and every question on the test, before she slept in her seat.The supervising teacher turned a blind eye as she was long used to students with poorer results sleeping during the examination.Wang Rourou who saw Yun Jian writing only for a short moment wore a widening grin.Look, wasn\u2019t she acting like she\u2019s the greatest? She must be stumped after answering the test for only ten minutes!Haha, her current state must be due to the questions being too difficult, she doesn\u2019t know how to answer them!Never in Wang Rourou\u2019s wildest dream would she have thought that Yun Jian had only spent ten minutes on the test and she was done with the questions.When all the test papers were collected after the tests on Monday and Tuesday, the teachers were in no rush to mark them. The monthly test this time was a joint examination among five schools. All the papers would be submitted for scoring by the higher-ups.Consequently, the results were released a few days later as well.\u2026Early Friday morning, the sun was warm with a soft breeze blowing.The sunlight lined Yun Jian\u2019s figure with a layer of gold.She wore a high ponytail today and looked full of vim and vigor.With her bag hooked only on one side of her shoulders, Yun Jian entered the classroom rather relaxed.Li Xiangyi\u2019s shout came from her back. \u201cYun Jian, go to the sports ground quickly. The basketball match is starting soon. Those buffoons from Dongjiang Town have already been waiting there for a long time. We can\u2019t lose in spirit!\u201dYun Jian gently pressed her lips together. She did not reply to Li Xiangyi directly, choosing to speak with her actions.She was standing by the classroom door. When she heard Li Xiangyi, she grabbed her bag and shot it toward her desk that was a few meters away.Score!A precise aim of her bag from the classroom door landed onto her desk. Yun Jian turned to follow Li Xiangyi to the field, leaving a group of dumbstruck students in the class.\u201cOh my god, Yun Jian is so cool!\u201d A boy in the class could not help gasping after a few beats of silence.\u201cI\u2019d looked down at Yun Jian representing our school at the basketball competition, but witnessing what she did just now, I\u2019m impressed! C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go cheer for her at the field!\u201dThe boys in the class marched to the field merrily.Lu Feiyan was already there, having reserved a good spot to cheer for Yun Jian.The basketball competition between Xinjiang Town Junior High School and Dongjiang Town Junior High School was held in the former school\u2019s home ground.Due to the location, most of the academic staff and students had all gathered at the field.Currently on the basketball court, Yun Jian\u2019s dainty frame looked small and fragile among the tall and sturdy basketball players.You can also listen onLiked it?

When he saw Yun Jian, his eyes nearly squashed into straight lines from how much he was grinning.With Yun Jiang playing in Xinjiang Town Junior High, the Dongjiang Town Junior High would definitely win!A girl playing basketball. - Hah, they must be joking!In fact, Zhang Jun was not the only one with this thought. The majority of Xinjiang Town Junior High\u2019s teaching faculty and students shared the same worry.A girl participating and playing against the basketball team of Dongjiang Town Junior High School was something that had never happened in recent years.After all, it was a fact that girls were physically weaker than boys.Could victory still be theirs?Nonetheless, everyone watched in anticipation.\u201cBeep!\u201dThe judge\u2019s whistle was blown.Both teams took their place.There were three sets of matches for this basketball competition, the best of three would win. This meant that the first team to win two games would be considered the winner.Compared to the other players who were fairly nervous, Yun Jian was in a great state of mind. She was not on edge at all from the basketball game.As the sole girl on the basketball court of this competition, Yun Jian inevitably gained the spectators\u2019 attention.\u201cI declare the start of the first game of the annual friendly basketball match between Xinjiang Town Junior High and Dongjiang Town Junior High. Players, get ready!\u201d\u201cReady\u2026 beep!\u201dThe judge blew the whistle that signified the official beginning of the contest.\u201cGo, Yun Jian! Go, Yun Jian!\u201dRight as the whistle was blown and the match started, a thunderous and synchronized cheering erupted.The spectators looked up in surprise toward where the shouting came from, only to see everyone from Class (6) of the ninth grade encouraging Yun Jian rhythmically.The acclamation was deafening.Back on the basketball court, Yun Jian\u2019s comparatively smaller frame had sprinted off with the basketball, traveling like a strike of lightning once the match began.It was as if the ball had gained a life of its own in her hands as it looked nimble and dynamic.Watching Yun Jian close the distance to the opponent\u2019s hoop, Zhang Jun stared at her in panic and shouted at his team members. \u201cBlock her, block her!\u201dHe did not expect Wen Rui to hand the crucial first ball directly to Yun Jian, nor did he expect that the girl whom he had looked down upon actually possessed such speed!She was getting close! - Closer!Glancing at the two opposing players who were stopping her advance, Yun Jian suddenly wore a smile.There was a rule in basketball stating you should dribble the ball, and to not run while holding it.In spite of it, there was no way they could stop her!Yun Jian grinned. Giving the basketball in her hand a dribble, the ball bounced toward in between the two players from the opposing team at an amazing speed that neither were quick enough to respond.As the ball passed both players who were supposed to block her, Yun Jian ran toward them as well.\u201cIs she crazy? She\u2019s passing the ball to them directly! We\u2019re gonna lose, we\u2019re gonna lose!\u201dThe spectators shrieked.However, when Yun Jian was right in front of the two opposing team players, she took a hard stomp and sprang up.The next scene came as a huge surprise to everyone, stunning them on the spot.Leaping two meters tall, Yun Jian flipped right over the boys and landed soundly on the court.The basketball went through both members as well, following its trajectory and landing in Yun Jian\u2019s hands to be dribbled once again\u2026The spectators dropped their jaws.The court and the sidelines were dead silent.Everyone had only one thought through their minds. \u201cOh my god, you could play basketball like that!? Wow, this girl\u2026 she\u2019s a tough cookie!\u201dThe conclusion of their emotions was \u201cHoly sh*t!\u201d.They were completely in shock.You can also listen onLiked it?

In addition, the one who ended the game so briefly was Yun Jian whom everyone had thought would burden the team.It was Yun Jian from ninth grade\u2019s Class (6)!After the first round was won, the second game came into play.Undoubtedly, would Xinjiang Town Junior High still lose when Wen Rui\u2019s team had Yun Jian? - Yun Jian, who had unbelievably evaded two opposing defenders blocking her and made a shot.Zhang Jun\u2019s team had a wavering spirit once the second round started and Dongjiang Town Junior High School\u2019s basketball team was swift to crumble.Two consecutive victories!Xinjiang Town Junior High School\u2019s basketball team had defeated Dongjiang Town Junior High School\u2019s basketball team in a flash!This was unprecedented!There was never a team to earn their victory in such a short time since the history of both schools\u2019 annual friendly matches.They were playing the best of three, so there was no need for the third game since Xinjiang Town Junior High School had won two consecutive games.Amidst the school\u2019s hurrah and applause, Zhang Jun and his team made a hasty exit.\u201cYun Jian, you\u2019re absolutely\u2026 amazing!

It\u2019s Friday too.

You\u2019re our star today!\u201d Li Xiangyi spoke first before Wen Rui could say anything.\u201cMy mom\u2019s taking me to Longmen City tomorrow. I can\u2019t be out too late tonight,\u201d Yun Jian explained softly.The team was taken aback for a beat before they nodded in agreement.Qin Yirou was taking Yun Jian to Longmen City on Saturday morning.That was the reality.They could no longer stay at the current house. With Lu Lanhua\u2019s character, the three of them would have to move sooner or later.Qin Yirou did not want to return to her family. Her family\u2019s attitude was apparent from Qin Junlan.Coincidentally, Qin Yirou had a best friend in Longmen City and she was a government official too.With nowhere to go to now, Qin Yirou thought of asking for her help.In spite of it, they had not seen each other for years. Since Qin Yirou married Yun Gang, she had much fewer chances to meet her best friend. She did not know if she would still help her after so many years.The best friend of Qin Yirou was her closest friend during high school. Both of them shared each other\u2019s secrets.Qin Yirou had been an outstanding student then, managing to get into Di Yi Senior High School like Yun Yi. It was just that her family condition after that did not allow her to continue schooling and she had to drop out halfway to marry Yun Gang.You can also listen onLiked it?

    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Meeting An Old Friend AgainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationEarly the next morning, Qin Yirou had brought Yun Jian along to take the public bus to the bustling center of Longmen City.Then, Qin Yirou painstakingly hailed a cab and came to the city\u2019s Furen Street. She had remembered this place according to her blurry memory.Furen Street was like its name. Those who stayed here were either affluent or influential.Qin Yirou\u2019s best friend was a high ranking government official. There was no doubt that she was rich.Qin Yirou was actually embarrassed to make the trip but she was now trapped at an impasse. She had evaluated every possible solution and could now only ask for help, given there were no alternatives to take.Clenching her teeth, Qin Yirou steeled herself and knocked on the door.\u201cDong, dong, dong!\u201dAfter rapping for some time, there was no noise from the inside of the house.Yun Jian watched Qin Yirou knock the door wholeheartedly from the side and could not help holding her hand. \u201cMom, the door is soundproof. They won\u2019t be able to hear you from the inside if you knock like that.\u201dAs she spoke, she pressed the doorbell beside the door and smiled sweetly at Qin Yirou. \u201cYou should do this.\u201d\u201cOh, this way huh!\u201d Qin Yirou had no idea of such a gadget. She was stunned for a moment before she nodded.She thought deprecatingly, that she was really old now, unable to keep up with the times anymore.Right after Qin Yirou\u2019s words, the mansion\u2019s gate opened to reveal a modern-looking woman in her forties.The woman was voluptuous. Although she was in her forties, she maintained her appearance well. From a glance, she looked like she was just in her thirties.In comparison, Qin Yirou had half a head of grey hair and wrinkles that had lined the corners of her eyes. As her age increased, her figure was growing plumper too.\u201cXiao Ruan\u2026\u201d Qin Yirou felt a pinch on her nose the moment she saw the woman and called out to her.\u201cYirou?\u201d Dong Ruan was still caught at a loss when she saw Qin Yirou.It had only been five to six years since they last met but Qin Yirou had gone through such a massive change. Age had taken a toll on her face and figure. Where was that youthful and vibrant girl from back then?There was a pang to Dong Ruan\u2019s heart. Her hand gripped Qin Yirou\u2019s callused ones as her eyes brimmed with tears.\u201cWhat happened? Yirou, we\u2019ve not seen each other for just a few years. Why have you\u2026 turned yourself into this?\u201d Dong Ruan\u2019s tears finally fell as she spoke.When Qin Yirou remembered their past, she was unable to utter a word of what she had prepared. Instead, her tears fell pitter-pattering.The two old friends who had reunited after so long hugged each other tightly.The past had to be recounted, to explain the reason Qin Yirou turned into an inconsolable crying mess today.Back then, Qin Yirou planned to give up her studies and dropped out of high school in order for her elder brother to marry her sister-in-law and also for her elder sister to find a good husband in addition to her family\u2019s ailing condition.As her best friend, Dong Ruan vehemently opposed her plan and they had gotten into a heated argument.Ultimately, Qin Yirou returned to the town and got married.It was from then on that their friendship gradually faded but both of them had still kept in touch.Five years ago when Yun Gang was caught with a huge debt from gambling and was dunned, Dong Ruan had helped her with the sum since she was unable to afford repaying it.Without a doubt, Dong Ruan had advised Qin Yirou to split from Yun Gang, saying that the man was not dependable.Qin Yirou was reluctant and planned to give Yun Gang another chance, so both of them fought again.Qin Yirou looked meek but she was stubborn once she had made her decision.Back then Dong Ruan had said, \u201cIf you continue on like this, that bastard Yun Gang will cheat on you one day. Then it will be too late for you to regret it!\u201dIt was because of her words that Qin Yirou held them against Dong Ruan for years.Both women were mulish. No one was willing to give in on the matter, thus they severed ties since then.Qin Yirou knew that Yun Gang was a gambling addict, but she had always believed that he would not cheat. That was why she persevered and remained married to Yun Gang.She had honestly never expected that Yun Gang would actually cheat.Like what Dong Ruan had said, she regretted it immensely.You can also listen onLiked it?

The Appearance Of The Male LeadPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euListening to Qin Yirou\u2019s brief narration of her troubles throughout the years, Dong Ruan felt her heart aching for her as well as burning in wrath.Dong Ruan\u2019s character was distinct compared to Qin Yirou. She was unable to withstand injustice, a classic career woman, and was already gritting her teeth in fury listening to Qin Yirou\u2019s account.\u201cYun Gang is a jerk. Yirou, I told you before, Yun Gang and his family are wretched. You just wouldn\u2019t listen!\u201d Dong Ruan was still furious when she spoke, but her tone was remorseful.\u201cOh, Yirou, you should\u2019ve come to me a long time ago. How could I not help you when it was that serious?\u201d Dong Ruan said earnestly.It was only then that Dong Ruan noticed Yun Jian who was standing beside Qin Yirou.\u201cThis is Xiao Jian, right? Look how much she\u2019s grown! I remember back then she was only ten! And now she\u2019s a big girl! She must be in junior high now, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Dong Ruan patted Qin Yirou\u2019s shoulder and stopped mentioning the sad past.Qin Yirou wiped away her tears and smiled. \u201cYeah, Xiao Jiao is a ninth grader in Xinjiang Town Junior High.\u201dAs she said that, she gave Yun Jian a tap and signaled her saying, \u201cXiao Jian, this is mom\u2019s best friend. You can call her Aunt Dong.\u201d\u201cNice to meet you, Aunt Dong,\u201d Yun Jian greeted politely as she looked at Dong Ruan.Dong Ruan\u2019s kindness to Qin Yirou was sincere. Yun Jian could see it from her eyes.One\u2019s gaze cannot lie.Dong Ruan was genuinely concerned for Qin Yirou.\u201cAy, good girl! Yirou, your kid is great!\u201d Dong Ruan grinned at Yun Jian and could not help praising.After that, both women chatted again.Having not met for so many years, it was certain that they had a lot to tell each other.Engaged in the conversation, Dong Ruan turned to ask Yun Jian, \u201cXiao Jiao, why don\u2019t you move to Longmen City since you guys are leaving that house anyway? Come stay at Aunt Dong\u2019s place. You\u2019re a ninth grader now and you\u2019ll be sitting for your high school entrance exam soon. I\u2019ll transfer you to Yi High okay? Yi High\u2019s education is the standard!\u201dQin Yirou had told Dong Ruan everything just now.Since she was divorcing Yun Gang and the house they were staying at was Yun Gang\u2019s property, she had to seek alternative accommodation.Dong Ruan gave it a thought. Her house was huge anyway, so she offered to move Qin Yirou\u2019s family to Longmen City.Qin Yirou was grateful for her help. They had been long-time friends, after all, so she was less courteous.Furthermore, Dong Ruan could transfer Xiao Jian to Yi High!Yi High\u2019s faculty and education were excellent. It was the best junior high school in Longmen City.Plenty of parents had cracked their heads just to send their children to this school, not minding to splurge either, but their efforts were possibly futile.Xiao Jian\u2019s results were poor but they could definitely pick up once she was admitted into the school.When both women reached a consensus, Dong Ruan then asked if Yun Jian was willing to transfer to Longmen City.After all, the child\u2019s opinion was significant.Transferring school meant that she had to enter a new environment and mingle with a new body of people. More specifically, she was transferring in the middle of her ninth grade academic year. It posed a concern that she would be isolated when she went to a new school.Yun Jian was taken aback. She had been planning to relocate her family to Longmen City. Now that Dong Ruan had mentioned it, their thoughts were coincidently aligned.\u201cHmm\u2026 I\u2019m fine,\u201d said Yun Jian with a press of lips and a nod.It was decided.\u201cScreech!\u201dA loud braking sound echoed from the mansion\u2019s yard out of the blue.A shiny black limited edition sports car drifted on the spot and parked right in front of them.The noise shocked Qin Yirou as cars were a rare sight during this era. What was more, it was a sports car.In addition, the vehicle abruptly drifted to stop right in front of them.Yun Jian narrowed her eyes in curiosity when the car door opened to reveal a tall figure from the driver seat.The person\u2019s face came into view. He was handsome, introspective, and enigmatic.When she got a clear view, Yun Jian was stunned.It was him?You can also listen onLiked it?

Why was the girl he had encountered that day here? Regardless, his expression remained stoic.Walking over with his tall figure, Si Yi glanced at Yun Jian with his narrow eyes and greeted Dong Ruan curtly. \u201cAunt.\u201dAunt?Yun Jian was astonished. The man\u2019s nonchalance after killing someone that day and his ability to drive away the secret agent, Enchantress, who was ranked tenth among secret agents was evidence that he was mysterious and unpredictable.She did not know who he was but she knew that someone who could make Enchantress give in was definitely a presence to be wary of.Such a person was actually the relative of her mother\u2019s best friend?As she thought about this, Si Yi had already entered through the door and walked past them. His tall and lean figure disappeared from their sight swiftly.Dong Ruan could only grin awkwardly at Qin Yirou and Yun Jian as she explained, \u201cThis is my elder sister\u2019s kid. He\u2019s spent a lot of years abroad and has only come back for a few days recently\u2026 The child isn\u2019t good with strangers. Yirou, don\u2019t mind him!\u201d\u201cOf course not. He\u2019s quite good looking and looks quite like you, Xiao Ruan!\u201d Qin Yirou said with a hand over her mouth chuckling, not at all minding the boy\u2019s cold treatment.Soon, Dong Ruan and Qin Yirou continued with their endless chatter.Yun Jian stood here with a slight frown, not at all impatient.She pondered about it but she could not figure it out. Alas, she instead gave up.Dong Ruan let Qin Yirou and Yun Jian stay during noon to have lunch at her place, before allowing them to head back to Xinjiang Town. Unable to refuse her, both of them stayed for the meal.However, Yun Jian had not seen Si Yi after that.After lunch, she and Qin Yirou went back to town.According to Dong Ruan, she would handle the school transfer procedure for Yun Jian in the upcoming days. She had a lot of connections in Longmen City. When she was done with the procedure, she would inform Qin Yirou.Then, Yun Jian and Qin Yirou would move out of that house and temporarily stay at Dong Ruan\u2019s.Yun Jian was unable to tell Qin Yirou directly that she had the money to buy a house in cash in Longmen City.In short, they would just relocate there first and she would plan her next course of action later.As they were moving away from Xinjiang Town, Qin Yirou was still somehow heavyhearted, using the remaining days she had to bid farewell with her neighbors. She reminded Yun Jian as well, \u201cXiao Jian, your Aunt Dong says that your transfer will mostly be approved the week after next. You still have a week in Xinjiang Town Junior High, you should say goodbye to your friends properly! Don\u2019t forget to let your teacher know too.\u201dYun Jian nodded and answered, \u201cI know, mom.\u201dTransferring school soon, she did not know how to mention it to Lu Feiyan.Lu Feiyan was the original body\u2019s best friend and she had been nothing but wonderful towards her. Yun Jian had genuinely seen Lu Feiyan as her friend. In addition, the latter would be reluctant for her to leave.As expected, the girl cried when Yun Jian told her about the matter. She was both laughing and crying as she said, \u201cXiao Jian, it\u2019s good news that you can directly transfer to Yi High. Even the last ranking students there are able to get into the number two ranked foreign language high school in our city! You must study well there!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t cry anymore.\u201d Yun Jian did not know how to comfort people and could only pass Lu Feiyan a tissue for her to wipe her tears.After that, she winked at Lu Feiyan. \u201cStudy hard. Let\u2019s go into Di Yi High School together.\u201dLu Feiyan did not grumble about the school being a hard target to achieve anymore. She gritted her teeth and broke out a grin. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Xiao Jian, we can get into the same school after a year!\u201dSimultaneously in the school\u2019s teacher\u2019s office, a teacher, who was sorting through the test papers from the joint monthly examination between the five schools, exclaimed in incredible disbelief, \u201cPerfect score! It\u2019s another perfect score! This student from Class (6) of ninth grade took four tests and scored perfect full marks in all papers!

For Xiao Jian to study there, it was beneficial to both her future and her current studies.\u201cHey, the results from the joint five-school monthly examination are out! I heard that the highest scoring student is from our school!\u201d A classmate who was more informed announced. He had his chin tipped up in pride, as if he was the one who had emerged first in the joint examination.It came as no surprise when the entire class\u2019 attention assumed it to be him as he declared it.\u201cAy, is it true? That\u2019s a test sat by students from five schools and the top one is from our school? This has never happened before!\u201d\u201cOne must know that Yi High was also one of the five schools participating. That\u2019s the city\u2019s best junior high school with a lot of straight A students!\u201d\u201cI heard that the best students at Yi High were very close to getting a perfect score. Is there really someone in our school who ranked first among the five schools? You must be bluffing, unless we have someone who scored full marks in every paper. But how could someone like that exist?\u201dThere were students in the classroom who did not believe it and retorted the informed student just now.\u201cHeh heh, bingo! You actually got it! This person from our school actually got perfect scores in every paper. It shocked all our teachers!\u201d The student replied boastfully again.It was as if he was the recipient of this immense glory.Nonetheless, no matter how resourceful the student was, he was unable to identify who the perfect-scoring student that emerged top one among five schools was.Instantly, the entire class was heatedly talking about the gossip.\u201cWow, Xiao Jian, that person is amazing to score full marks in every subject! The person\u2019s even surpassed those crazy scholars in Yi High!\u201d Lu Feiyan who had finally adjusted her emotions talked to Yun Jian with admiration in her gaze.Yun Jian replied to her with a slight smile and a glint that flashed across her eyes.\u201cHah, the perfect score is not even yours, what are you two being so prideful about?\u201d Wang Rourou was waiting for Yun Jian\u2019s lousy result to be announced so she could sneer at her. Otherwise, she really could not withstand the indignation that she had to go through recently.Perhaps it was because Lu Feiyan was Yun Jian\u2019s best friend. Wang Rourou could not help running over to ridicule them first after she heard what Lu Feiyan said.\u201cOh yeah, Yun Jian, I saw that you\u2019ve only answered the papers for ten minutes during the monthly test. What were you doing? Were the papers too difficult? Say, why didn\u2019t you complete the workbooks properly each time? How can you score well with an attitude like that? You\u2019d better not embarrass our class again this time!\u201d Wang Rourou turned to look at Yun Jian despisingly.\u201cWang Rourou, are you so free that you have to bark at everyone you can? I\u2019m talking to Xiao Jian, what does it have to do with you!\u201d Lu Feiyan jabbed back for Yun Jian, unable to stand the girl.On the other hand, Yun Jian was unperturbed.

What do I do?\u201dEvery time the monthly test results were released, there were students who were joyful and there were students who were fretful.With some students scoring exceptionally, naturally there were also students who did not do well or for some reason and were below par.Students who thought that they had done alright sat at their desks in anticipation.Yun Jian sat at her place without any change in expression while Wang Rourou and Lu Feiyan\u2019s banter naturally stopped there and then.The teacher was here, all the students had gone back to their respective seats to prepare for the class.Madam Jin, who wore a pair of black canvas shoes, had a beaming aura. Even students who were nervous could clearly feel her upbeat mood.\u201cThe results are out.\u201d Madam Jin told the class airily as she stood at the rostrum while occasionally taking glimpses at Yun Jian who was seated at the corner.\u201cEveryone knows that this monthly test is a joint examination by five schools and the difficulty level was higher.\u201d Madam Jin squinted as she spoke and feigned suspense. \u201cWe have a friend in this class whose results were extremely excellent!\u201dShe halted after this, giving her class a hint but not revealing the whole case.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll hand your Chinese papers back first. When your name is called, please step forward to take your test paper. The order of your names are not related to your ranking,\u201d said Madam Jin as she took the stack of papers and called out one name after another.\u201cZhou Xiaoshan, 89 marks.\u201d\u201cYang Lei, 67 marks.\u201d\u2026\u201cMiss Wang Rourou made quite a huge improvement this time, she\u2019s scored 108 marks! Please give her a round of applause,\u201d Madam Jin reported.Wang Rourou who was summoned stood up. She was very pleased with herself as she was the Chinese class representative and the homeroom teacher had complimented her in front of the whole class.She lifted her chin up proudly and walked to the rostrum.Full marks for Chinese was 120. Taking away a few necessary deductions from the essay portion, Wang Rourou\u2019s 108 marks was considerably high.When she got her paper back, Wang Rourou purposely spread her paper to a certain angle so when she passed Yun Jian, the latter could see the big red \u201c108\u201d ink on the corner of it.Her expression was exceptionally conceited, as if she was afraid that Yun Jian did not know that she had scored 108 marks.Before Wang Rourou returned to her seat, Madam Jin\u2019s soothing voice was tinged with thrilling excitement as she suppressed the ecstasy within her to exclaim, \u201cOur next classmate\u2019s results are unimaginable. Uh, not only has she scored full marks in Chinese during this monthly test, she\u2019s scored perfect marks in her three other subjects as well. The maximal mark was 510 and she\u2019s received all 510 of them! She ranked top one in the five-school joint examination! She\u2019s Yun Jian!

Oh, now they remembered!Yun Jian had only been writing for a moment before she was sleeping on her desk during the day of examination!How did she actually score the highest out of five schools?Did that mean Yun Jian could obtain a perfect score by simply and easily answering the papers that felt challenging to them?\u201cYou said it yourself. I only took ten minutes for every paper. How am I supposed to cheat? Copy from others? Does anyone else have better results than me? Or did I copy from books or notes? Will I be able to copy the answers in ten minutes?\u201d Yun Jian was not the type to stay quiet when she was accused. She stood up and countered Wang Rourou.Madam Jin coughed, apparently agreeing with Yun Jian.After all, she was the homeroom teacher of Class (6) and was their Chinese teacher. She had been teaching for at least decades. Analyzing many students\u2019 answers, she could see right through them if they had written it on their own or if they had cheated.Furthermore, it was like what Yun Jian had said. If she had cheated, how did she?If she were to copy from others, no one in the class did as well as her model answers.Even if she were to copy from the textbooks, she would not be able to achieve perfect scores in all four subjects!Honestly, Madam Jin was the most surprised when Yun Jian\u2019s results were announced.How could someone\u2019s results take such a big leap?She had risen to number one of the five schools from last in her own school!\u201cAlright, quit it. The school has verified the matter and has analyzed Miss Yun Jian\u2019s paper. We\u2019re sure that she certainly did not cheat because Miss Yun Jian\u2019s mathematical workings, arguments in Chinese essay, and thought process in the English answers were written in much detail. She\u2019s basically on par with a college student or even a master\u2019s student!\u201dMadam Jin breathed out deeply as she spoke, the astonishment that hit her had yet to recover since first discovering Yun Jian\u2019s results.The class also sucked in a deep breath when they heard Madam Jin.

He was a \u2018man\u2019 and he could not weep like a girl, thus he could only express his feelings bluntly.Yun Jian met his eyes with a smile. Having spent days together, she too had taken the basketball team as her friends.\u201cWe\u2019ll meet again in Longmen City one year from now!\u201d Yun Jian\u2019s farewell speech was short but it gave everyone anticipation.\u201cOkay! You\u2019ll have to be our guide by then!\u201d Li Xiangyi said with a chuckle and a habitual scratch on his head as he stood on the side.Yun Jian nodded with a grin, her beauty dazzling everyone again.\u201cXiao Jian, Xiao Yi, we\u2019ve got to go. We\u2019ll miss the bus if we\u2019re late. Let\u2019s board now.\u201d Qin Yirou bid goodbye to her neighbors respectively and called her children.She was finally leaving this place for which she spent half of her life living in, but it had grown to dishearten her. It was as if the burden in her heart was relieved during this moment.As the family boarded the bus they departed.Yun Jian could see Lu Feiyan shouting goodbye chasing the vehicle when she turned back, until she could no longer see the latter.She could not lay a finger on how she felt at that point of time, but she knew that she was destined to keep moving forward.She was not someone who prioritized kinship, however, she was not heartless.She would not stop moving forward for anyone either.\u2026When they arrived at the bus stop, Dong Ruan drove to pick them up personally.The woman was doing well, having both a house and a car.The only regret was that her husband had passed away. It had been a car accident. He was killed at the scene.She was left with her son who was only eight years old.Other than spending time with her son in the mansion, she was usually lonely. Now that Qin Yirou\u2019s family was moving in, Dong Ruan was overjoyed.The mansion was huge, so there were a lot of rooms to accommodate them.Dong Ruan assigned two rooms each to Yun Jian, Yun Yi, and Qin Yirou, a bedroom and a study room, yet the mansion was still empty.Qin Yirou refused the study room since she had no need for it.After settling down, she planned to head out and look for a job. This was someone else\u2019s home after all, she would not feel at ease staying here long term.Once she saved enough money, they would move out.Dong Ruan had initially opposed the idea of Qin Yirou working. The latter\u2019s hand injury had just healed.Later, she was unable to persuade her and found her a manageable job.The monthly wage was quite high too. At least, it was much higher than what Qin Yirou worked for at the textile factory.As Yun Jian temporarily called the place home, she met Si Yi almost every day but they did not talk to each other.Carrying her old schoolbag, she went to register herself in her new school Yi High, on the third morning since they had moved in.You can also listen onLiked it?

This was the school\u2019s full name.Yun Jian was a transfer student and had come in halfway through the academic semester, thus she had gone to report herself at the principal\u2019s office once she arrived at the new school.Principal Zhang was a middle-aged man with a square face. He sat straight and serious like a stern educator.Dong Ruan was a government official and it was said that she was a high ranking official in the city\u2019s education ministry. Being introduced to the school via Dong Ruan, Principal Zhang\u2019s attitude toward Yun Jian was with a hint of fawning.He had even arranged Yun Jian into the best class of the ninth grade, Class A.Each grade in this school named their classes with letters. For example, Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, and more for every grade.Of course, students who could enter Longmen Yi Junior High School were either from wealthy families or their academic results were impeccable, while students of Class A in each grade were the elites among these students.Due to Dong Ruan\u2019s background, Yun Jian was assigned to Class A immediately.The homeroom teacher of ninth grade\u2019s Class A was a female teacher who had just graduated from college. Miss Yu looked exceptionally young, probably around her early twenties.Getting a position like this as soon as she graduated, Miss Yu\u2019s family must either be affluent or influential as well.She took Yun Jian to the dorm first and let the girl store her belongings there before taking her to Class A.The Longmen Yi Junior High School had a rule. Students of the school were supposed to board in the dorms from Monday to Friday. There were no exceptions, even if one were a young master of a rich household.Yun Jian knew of this a long time ago and had brought along her daily necessities when she came. She did not take long to put away her things as she did not have much to begin with.The students in Class A of the ninth grade were playful and merry during breaks. Miss Yu led Yun Jian into the classroom and signaled the class to quiet down.\u201cThis is our new transfer student. I hope that all of you can be friends. We\u2019ll have our new student introduce herself next,\u201d said Miss Yu.The whole class was looking at Yun Jian with a stare when Miss Yu spoke.The girl was truly pretty with big eyes and thin eyebrows. Her long eyelashes fluttered when she blinked, looking dainty and adorable. It was just that her faded old clothes did not match her features.\u201cTsk, I bet she\u2019s another kid from the poor outskirts. I really don\u2019t know how people like this get into Class A!\u201d a girl said rolling her eyes after taking a jealous glance at Yun Jian\u2019s appearance.Most of the students here spoke their mind without consideration as they had the advocacy of wealthy families. Even the teachers could only turn a blind eye and feign oblivion.Yun Jian heard her too but she pretended like she did not and made a simple introduction. \u201cI\u2019m Yun Jian.\u201dNo more? She was supposed to introduce herself? That was all?Her classmates were stunned. They somehow felt that her name was familiar.Someone suddenly recalled this familiar name and spoke loudly, \u201cI remember now! So you\u2019re Yun Jian? You\u2019re that Yun Jian who scored top one in the five-school examination with perfect scores across all subjects!\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

In spite of it, the teacher assigned to this class was the best in the entire grade.It was obvious that in this world, wealthy and powerful people have the advantage.Nonetheless, in Class A there were also straight-A students who scored the best in the city but had no family background.When the student identified Yun Jiam, in addition to her current attire, the entire class automatically classified her to said group, the ones who were poor but performed incredibly well in their studies.If the international tycoons, who knew Yun Jian in her previous life, heard what these people were saying, they would most probably be rolling on the floor laughing.What a joke! Poor and weak Yun Jian?Who are you kidding?Could she monopolize the entire commerce lane if she was poor? Could she do whatever she wanted in the black market if she was weak?After some clamor in the class, Miss Yu pointed calmly at a desk behind the classroom that was near the trashcan and told Yun Jian, \u201cHave a seat there first. We\u2019ll rearrange the seats again in a few days and will move you to the front then.\u201dIt was not Miss Yu\u2019s intention to isolate Yun Jian, but the classroom was full. That was the only vacant spot.Yi High had always been the school where the city\u2019s parents cracked their heads just to send their children there. If it were not for Dong Ruan, the spot beside the trashcan would probably have been long snatched too.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian nodded and went down the rostrum toward the seat that Miss Yu had indicated.There were a lot of young and rich kids in Class A. Expectedly, there were a lot of them who were up to mischief.As Yun Jian walked through the aisle to the back of the classroom, she saw a boy chortling with a hand over his mouth like he was up to no good.His scheme was all written on his face, however.Yun Jian remained oblivious and made her way to the back.When she was near the chuckling boy, he suddenly stuck his leg out in an attempt to trip Yun Jian, plotting to tease the newcomer.A lot of students in the class were laughing silently, as if accustomed to how the boy would greet new kids.The scenario they imagined would be Yun Jian tripping over without being aware, falling onto the floor with a loud thud while the entire class laughed to their hearts\u2019 content.However, this was not the reality.The boy then stuck his leg out. Yun Jian wore a smirk as her foot that was going to walk over, it instead hovered in the air under everyone\u2019s anticipation.The boy\u2019s leg was already extended in the aisle when Yun Jian\u2019s hovering foot stepped on it.\u201cAh!\u201d The boy\u2019s leg was instead stomped by Yun Jian as he moaned in pain, \u201cOuch, ouch, ouch! It hurts!\u201dYun Jian crushed it with brute force. There was a slight pause before she lifted her leg with shiny eyes that were looking ahead.She had accurately stepped on the boy\u2019s leg based on her intuition.When the class witnessed this, they were all dumbfounded.Each time a new student who did not have much family support but studied incredibly well joined, they would be bullied, just like how the boy attempted just now.In spite of it, none of them had managed to avoid it.However, when Yun Jian walked over, she looked like she did not know anything about it.Why then, had the person being stepped on became the boy?It was as if the new kid already knew their dirty trick but kept it to herself!You can also listen onLiked it?

Instead, he chuckled and rubbed his leg that he had already retracted. All the while he teased Yun Jian right in front of the teacher, \u201cHey, newbie! You\u2019re pretty good! Let\u2019s be friends! I\u2019m Zhang Shaofeng, you are?\u201dAlthough Yun Jian had introduced herself before the entire class, no one actually paid attention to the new kid\u2019s name.Yun Jian ignored him and walked right past him toward her designated seat.There were immediately girls in the class who were upset.Zhang Shaofeng was one of the popular guys in school. He was handsome and extremely charismatic. More crucially, his family was affluent. It was said that he was an heir to a successful group in Longmen City and with a worth in the millions.Many girls in Class A were his admirers.Therefore, they were instantly displeased by the newcomer Yun Jian.\u201cWhat\u2019s the newbie so proud about? How dare she ignore Young Master Feng? Does she really think she\u2019s a gem? Pfft!\u201d\u201cYeah! She\u2019d better take a look at what she\u2019s wearing - tsk, did she pick up her clothes from the street? How could she wear those!\u201d\u2026Yi High\u2019s students were well-to-do. Consequently, in school they liked vying for nothing, comparing who wore the latest and most expensive luxury branded apparel.Yun Jian\u2019s attire caused her to become another topic of discussion among the girls who had not liked her since her introduction.Nonetheless, Yun Jian ignored all of them as if she could not hear.Her seat was beside the trashcan, so she had no desk mate.Just as she wanted to take a little rest and close her eyes, someone touched her arm.Opening her eyes, she was greeted by a docile-looking girl who sat in front of her.\u201cHi, nice to meet you. I\u2019m Chen Xinyi. Can I be your friend?\u201d The girl blinked cutely and continued with a tone so casual it was as if she already knew her. \u201cI know your name it\u2019s Yun Jian. You don\u2019t have to introduce yourself again, okay?\u201dChen Xinyi was gracious. There was a sense of opulence in her vibe, but she did not criticize or look down at Yun Jian like other girls just because of how she dressed.This elicited a sliver of affability from Yun Jian.She nodded and replied to the cute girl. \u201cSure.\u201d\u201cYou agreed. We\u2019re friends from now on, you can\u2019t go back on your word!\u201d Chen Xinyi grinned before she made a funny face at Yun Jian playfully.Right after that, the bell for class rang.Chen Xinyi chuckled and pursed her lips. \u201cWe have to start our lessons. Let\u2019s go to the cafeteria together for lunch.\u201dThe next lesson was English, they had a quiz. It was basically a test, so the third and fourth periods of the lessons were combined.After the two periods of class, it was lunch.Yi High\u2019s cafeteria employed a card payment system where students could load their lunch money onto a card and swipe them to pay for their ordered meal.Lunch was half an hour, sufficient for the students to queue up and eat.Yun Jian did not have her card yet. Chen Xinyi hooked arms with her and generously asked her to use her card first as the school\u2019s cafeteria did not accept cash payment.After receiving their meals and sitting themselves down on the lunch table, Chen Xinyi could not help firing questions at Yun Jian. Even the way she addressed her became friendly. \u201cJian Jian, which school were you in before your transfer?\u201dShe ate a spoonful as she spoke.Hearing \u201cJian Jian\u201d from Chen Xinyi, Yun Jian was surprised at how odd it sounded but did not give much attention to it.She did not dislike Chen Xinyi\u2019s friendliness.That was why she did not reject the latter when she took the initiative to hook arms with her just now.\u201cXinjiang Town Junior High School,\u201d Yun Jian replied, chewing a big mouthful of meat.Her figure was slightly on the petite side. It was still easy for her to fight an ordinary person, but if she were to encounter elite secret agents or assassins from her past life, she would lack physically. She had to nourish herself to build up her physique.\u201cWow, that must be fun\u2026\u201d Chen Xinyi did not mean any disdain. She was purely childlike.Right opposite of their table of four, a handsome beaming face of a boy sat down in front of Yun Jian with his food tray.Looking up, it was Zhang Shaofeng.The plain sight of Zhang Shaofeng roused screams and stares from some girls in the cafeteria.\u201cHey, newbie. I know that you\u2019re Yun Jian, right? Haha!\u201d Zhang Shaofeng was still grinning when he spoke to Yun Jian.He then scanned around before sticking closer to the girl and asked in a whisper, \u201cWhen you were about to be tripped in class, your eyes were looking ahead, not the floor. How did you know that I was going to trip you? Yun Jian, do you know martial arts? You\u2019re awesome! Don\u2019t tell me it was just a coincidence. I have sharp eyes. Can I be your pupil?

He\u2019s not a nice person!\u201dZhang Shaofeng and Chen Xinyi were actually cousins and had grown up bantering. As the former was a few months older, as well as him being a trickster, he was always bullying the poor girls.Consequently, Chen Xinyi took the opportunity and jabbed the boy in front of Yun Jian as revenge.\u201cShh, go away!\u201d Zhang Shaofeng bared his fist at Chen Xinyi hearing what she said and told Yun Jian, \u201cYun Jian, I don\u2019t care. Given you haven\u2019t said anything, I\u2019ll take your silence as an agreement to take me as your pupil!\u201dYun Jian cracked a half smile and shook the chopsticks in her hands, saying faintly, \u201cEat.\u201dThe other two were speechless.A week passed swiftly. Yun Jian had been relatively relaxed at the school without encountering any troubles.Even when there were some petty issues, Chen Xinyi and Zhang Shaofeng were there to cover for Yun Jian.Zhang Shaofeng had also been chasing after Yun Jian and incessantly called her \u201cmaster\u201d, shocking many others.Yun Jian was speechless about it.In the blink of an eye, it was already Friday. Yun Jian packed what she wanted to take home for the weekend, putting them all in her bag since she did not have much. With her backpack only slung on one shoulder, she left the dorm through the school gate.There was a direct route bus from Longmen Yi Junior High School\u2019s gate to the vicinity of Dong Ruan\u2019s mansion.Yun Jian stepped out of the school and walked toward the bus stand.There was a lot of foot traffic outside the school compound, as cars were not yet a common sight in this era. Majority of the students took the bus.\u201cScreech!\u201dWhile Yun Jian was waiting for the bus among the crowd, a black shiny limited edition Lamborghini sports car skidded to the vacant lot in front of the school gate before it halted securely.Yun Jian narrowed her eyes, having seen the charming Si Yi who sat in the driver seat from afar.Why was he here?With a squint, she wondered with curiosity since the guy was barely related to her.As she was engrossed by her thoughts, the girls who crowded around the gate were screaming.\u201cOh my god, who\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cSo charming! How can there be such a person so handsome in this world! Oh gosh, am I dreaming\u2026\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s he here to pick up? His girlfriend? Wow, I\u2019m so envious! His girlfriend must be a rich beautiful girl!\u201dCars were a rare sight in this era, but most of Yi High\u2019s students had private family cars. So it was not exactly a miracle to see a car appearing before the school.In spite of it, this Lamborghini sports car was limited edition. There were only a handful of units in the entire world.Even if one could not recognize its scarcity, one could at least guess its value.The crowd was stunned.While they held their breath staring at Si Yi, too afraid to breathe any louder, they saw Si Yi turning his perfectly sculpted face to look at Yun Jian with his deep beautiful eyes with his lips pressed together. \u201cGet in.\u201dGet in? Who? Everyone searched around for the person.Then, they saw a girl who wore a high ponytail and extremely old and faded clothes, without any branded apparel walking over.You can also listen onLiked it?

The first two times, they had only exchanged gazes. They did not even speak a word.What puzzled her was not that they had never been acquainted. Why was he picking her up?Nevertheless, she was not someone to make conversation.As a secret agent in her previous life, people like her needed to etch in their mind that - the lesser you know, the longer you live; do not open your mouth if it is not your business.Yun Jian was not one to make a fuss. She walked over and pulled the passenger seat of the Lamborghini open before slipping inside.A sports car like that only allowed one seated passenger. There were no additional back seats.Right as Yun Jian closed the door properly, having seated inside the car, the Lamborghini\u2019s accelerator was slammed as the whole car shot across the road like a rocket and disappeared from everyone\u2019s view like a gust of wind\u2026The crowd was still flabbergasted. They had cars at home but they had never seen a car reaching such incredible speed.The speed of the car just now, was not a simple act of driving, it had flown away! It honestly felt like a gust of wind!As the crowd watched the sports car speed off along with the handsome driver who picked up Yun Jian, they looked disappointed.A girl who was considerably pretty arched her brow at her friend while pointing towards the direction Yun Jian had left in. She spoke loudly, as if worried those around them would not hear her, \u201cIsn\u2019t that girl the newcomer of our class! I heard that she transferred here from an average school in a rural town!\u201dWith her words, the students around them shifted their attention to the girl indeed.The limelight pleased her as she continued talking.It was like she was actually the one who was picked up by the Lamborghini sports car just now.This girl had made an appearance before.When Yun Jian had first joined the class, the girl was the one who had mocked her right in front of the teacher, saying that Yun Jian must have come from the poor outskirts. Even ruthlessly jibing Yun Jian about how people like her get into the Class A.The girl was Lu Rongrong. It was as if she knew Yun Jian very well as she began boasting and spreading rumors in front of the school.\u2026It was currently the middle of October and the wind had just cooly swept the region. The weather was rather chilly, especially when it had been raining these days. The change of temperature was felt through one\u2019s bones.In the Lamborghini sports car, the heater was turned on. Contrary to the breezy outdoors, it felt warm and comfortable.Not long after the car left the school compound, Si Yi spoke up first, \u201cMy aunt asked me to pick you up.\u201dWhat he meant was picking her from school was Dong Ruan\u2019s idea and not his.Yun Jian nodded and hummed her reply. \u201cMm.\u201dShe was wearing short sleeves. Seated in the car, the warmth from its heater raised her temperature.Si Yi\u2019s driving skills were excellent. He kept a steady foot on the accelerator and wheezed past the busy roads wildly without brushing past anyone else.Yun Jian\u2019s driving skill in her previous life was top notch among the world too. She thought that Si Yi\u2019s abilities were parallel to hers. Perhaps there would be a difference when they actually contested against each other.Nonetheless, she was certain that Si Yi\u2019s skill was no worse than hers!You can also listen onLiked it?

Her gaze did not even waver. An ordinary girl would have been shrieking of shock from the terrifying speed.Si Yi narrowed his eyes.This girl had seemed to be extraordinary from the first time they met.Arriving at the mansion, Yun Jian went back to her room.At this point in time, no one was dismissed from work yet, whether it was Dong Ruan who was a high-ranking official or Qin Yirou who had gone out to work.The whole mansion housed only Yun Jian, and Si Yi who was in his room not too far away from hers.It was awkward.Yun Jian was already in her bedroom with her laptop switched on as she logged on to the secret webpage.\u201cBeep, beep, beep.\u201dThree beeps later, a notification window popped out. It was a recent message from Snake.Lizard that was short and sharp. \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dShe was already in Longmen City.Yun Jian pressed her lips while her fingers skid across the keyboard. \u201cWait for me. I\u2019ll come right now.\u201d She closed the webpage, turned off the laptop, and headed out after changing into casual clothes.As she stepped out of the door, she saw Si Yi opening his door to exit his room as well.Yun Jian blinked before she walked over to him and stretched out her hand unabashedly. \u201cLend me your Lamborghini.\u201dSi Yi arched his brow as he stared quizzically at Yun Jian. \u201cCan you drive?\u201dHe had checked the girl\u2019s identity. She came from an average background and was still an underage teenager.The truth, however, was not as simple.\u201cYeah,\u201d Yun Jian answered while waving her hand.Si Yi was generous, tossing the keys to the girl.His Lamborghini was a limited edition sports car and he personally had modified it too. It was rare for him to lend it to others. In fact, he had never let anyone else drive the car after it came to his possession.Yun Jian was the first one to drive it other than him.Si Yi did not even know why he had just let her borrow his car like that.In spite of it, Yun Jian was already seated in the driver seat of the Lamborghini with the engine ignited.She stepped on the accelerator, causing a steady rumble from the body of the car. Testing the car\u2019s specifications, she realized that it was a high-performance vehicle.Compared to her favorite car in her previous life, the LaFerrari, this was not lacking in any aspect!\u201cVroom, vroom\u2026 vroom!\u201dAs the last rev of the engine sounded, Yun Jian stepped on the accelerator and disengaged the clutch before the Lamborghini shot out like a strike of lightning.Right in front of the Glittery Gold Hotel, Yun Jian stepped on the brake. The Lamborghini abruptly drifted in front of the entrance and came to a secure stop.The Glittery Gold Hotel was a five-star hotel in Longmen City.One could dine and even be accommodated at the hotel. Its appeal came from its superb interior design that was one of the best in the city.Certainly, its price tag was relatively higher as well.In addition, Longmen City\u2019s high-ranking officials like the mayor, secretary, and other exclusive personages opted for this hotel whenever locational convenience was a consideration.Yun Jian hopped off the Lamborghini and entered the hotel with a squint.With the flash of her eyes, she saw a woman sitting at the corner.From behind, the woman looked ordinary, she was wearing a hat too. Yet her side profile was immaculate and beautiful.She was only in her twenties.Seated opposite her was a middle-aged man in his forties. They were currently conversing.Yun Jian walked over to them while holding a squint in her eyes.It was evident that the woman was Snake.Lizard.You can also listen onLiked it?

As predicted, she found Snake.Lizard.Snake.Lizard was talking to the middle-aged man opposite her. Once she noticed someone approaching them, she stopped the conversation and looked toward to where Yun Jian was.She could not help frowning deeply when she saw Yun Jian moving slowly toward them with both her hands in her pants pockets.Who was this girl?Yun Jian did not resemble her appearance from her previous life, not even the slightest bit. Even her shape and height were distinctly different.She was tall and alluring in her previous life but now, she was petite and adorable.Snake.Lizard could not be blamed for not recognizing her. Facing Yun Jian who was suddenly strolling toward them, she became alert.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The middle-aged man who had not noticed Yun Jian approaching was bewildered by Snake.Lizard who suddenly halted their conversation.Right after that question left his lips, Yun Jian was already right in front of them.The man was surprised. However, when he saw her clearly, he thought that Yun Jian was just a little troublemaker. At once, he waved at her in dismissal. \u201cLittle girl, go over there if you want to play. I have something important to discuss with this big sister here!\u201dAs he spoke, the middle-aged man pointed at the entrance, obviously thinking that Yun Jian had come to the wrong place.Disregarding the man\u2019s conjecture, Yun Jian stared at Snake.Lizard with her clear eyes and slightly pressed her lips together, before reciting a code message. In Yuan Jian\u2019s past life, when she was still the Slaying God, this message was something only she and Snake.Lizard knew. She spoke in German. \u201cYou can\u2019t slay a god, the snake won\u2019t turn into a lizard.\u201dSecret agents like them were proficient in various foreign languages, ranging from populous countries to small rural villages.She had set this code message together with Snake.Lizard back then, and they had agreed to communicate in German, or else it would be deemed ineffective.\u201cWhat are you blabbing about\u2026 Little girl, what are you saying?\u201d The man could not understand German, so he had no idea what Yun Jian had said.Just as he wanted to chase her away, Snake.Lizard stood up suddenly. The hem of her clothes had even brushed past the teacup on the table. Her hasty movement knocked the teacup, but she caught it instantly with her swift reflexes.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Snake.Lizard started but Yun Jian put her index finger on her lips with a shushing expression.Even this action was exactly the same as the Slaying God would do!Snake.Lizard suppressed the shock that was racking through her.Initially, Snake.Lizard and others had assumed that Yun Jian was lost. They concluded this having found that her beloved car was abandoned, the Ferrari sports car, yet she was nowhere to be seen.That sports car had never left Yun Jian\u2019s side. Even when she was out for a mission, she would drive it around.Wherever she was, her car there was as well.Yet when they found the car, there was no news of her. It could only mean that\u2026Not too long ago, however, Yun Jian had contacted Snake.Lizard. Utterly surprised, the latter was also relieved. Yun Jian was alright.After all, Slaying God was the top secret agent! How could something bad happen to her?It was up until Yun Jian revealed their code message and the hush-hush motion just now that Snake.Lizard\u2019s doubt seemed to be answered.\u201cI\u2019ll solve your concern in a few days. You can go now,\u201d Snake.Lizard said to the man while looking at Yun Jian.The man was flummoxed.What?A little girl had popped out suddenly and blabbered something, who would ever understand what she had just said\u2026 yet Snake.Lizard had asked him to leave first?However, the middle-aged man dared not offend the woman, so he turned to leave.\u201cThis is not the place to talk. Follow me,\u201d Yun Jian told Snake.Lizard as she went to the reception to ask for a booth.You can also listen onLiked it?

An Intentional Hard TimePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Slaying God?\u201dThere was only the two of them in the hotel booth. Snake.Lizard asked in disbelief with a deep frown while she stared at Yun Jian, who was seated on the bench opposite her, grinning with crescent eyes.No matter how she looked at the girl in front of her, who had thin limbs and a flawlessly pretty face, she was still a stark contrast from the Slaying God whom she knew - be it her face or her height.Currently, there were no outsiders. Yun Jian nodded at Snake.Lizard with a smirk. \u201cWho else can it be other than me?\u201dThat was also true. Who else, other than the Slaying God, could emanate the dominance that commanded her submission?Aside from the two of them, how could a third person know of the code message between them?\u201cWhy do you look like this now?\u201d She asked in a confounded tone. Snake.Lizard let down her guard. After repeatedly confirming that Yun Jian was the Slaying God.Was there anyone who could actually keep calm if they encountered someone they knew rebirthed into someone else\u2019s body?This was the reason Yun Jian had kept the truth from those around her after the rebirth.Even if she were open about it, no one would believe her. They might even think that she had lost her mind.However, it was different with Snake.Lizard. Yun Jian understood Snake.Lizard and knew her Achilles\u2019 heel. She could tell her the truth fearlessly.At the same time, when she was the secret agent, Slaying God. Snake.Lizard was the person she trusted the most.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story. I touched the box that day and when I woke up, this was who I became.\u201d Yun Jian shrugged and smiled helplessly.\u201cThat sandalwood box?\u201d Snake.Lizard asked, licking her lips.Her question earned a nod from Yun Jian.Snake.Lizard was the only one aware that in her past life, she was going to rescue her kidnapped younger brother.\u201cThere\u2019s no turning back. We can\u2019t change it. But I\u2019m happy with my current state.\u201d Yun Jian diverted the topic wearing a bashful smile.After her rebirth, she was grateful to possess the kinship that she had been longing for.Yun Jian then asked Snake.Lizard to tell her about the Gu Sha Mercenaries\u2019 current status.It put a frown on Snake.Lizard\u2019s brows as her tone turned more solemn. \u201cThose old men can\u2019t wait any longer!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Yun Jian chuckled with an arch of her brow.The old men referred to were some of Gu Sha Mercenaries\u2019 founding members. They were the subordinates of the organization\u2019s former boss.Yun Jian was only sixteen years old in her past life, still a very young age. It was just that she was inexplicably one year younger upon her rebirth, and became fifteen years old.During her previous life, when she was fourteen, she had personally killed Gu Sha\u2019s boss and led her squad into an invasion that later took control over the mercenary. It had only been two years since then.In spite of it, an assassin organization could not be fully supported by just a handful of people.Those old folks had been putting up with her, finding opportunities for an insurgence to wipe her out just because she had killed the former boss.Of course, Yun Jian would not let them get her way. She could even easily have eliminated those old men, but it was not the appropriate time.The old folks had a powerful support network. If she quashed them right away, Gu Sha Mercenaries\u2019 force would be greatly discounted. Consequently, it would pose a grave disadvantage to her if other assassin organizations leveraged the timing of their collapse.What she wanted to achieve was to completely replace the old members of Gu Sha Mercenaries with her own subordinates, letting those old folks fall one step after another into hell!\u201cStay here in Longmen City for now. There\u2019s no need to return to the organization. Notify Tiger.Leopard to keep a close eye on those men. If they\u2019re up to something new, report to me immediately.\u201d Yun Jian wore a half smile that looked enchantingly eerie.\u201cSure!\u201d Snake.Lizard nodded. She had never refused Yun Jian\u2019s order.Tiger.Leopard was the person who had answered Yun Jian\u2019s call in that random shop of Xinjiang Town.Snake.Lizard and Tiger.Leopard had absolute allegiance towards Yun Jian. This was because both of them were saved by her!Without Yun Jian, they would not be here today!\u2026When Yun Jian and Snake.Lizard came down from the hotel\u2019s booth, it was nearly evening.Yun Jian walked in front while Snake.Lizard was behind her. Both of them were strolling down the hotel\u2019s spiral staircase when a boisterous crowd of people came in through the entrance. Judging from their attire, one could tell that they were students.Yun Jian saw someone extremely familiar among the group.It was her elder brother Yun Yi. Why was he here?Yun Jian was surprised, but Yun Yi and the other kids did not see her. Nonetheless, she caught the unease of her brother\u2019s expression.The boy standing beside Yun Yi was not Xu Haozhe, but someone who was dressed rather trendy.The guy was suggesting brashly, \u201cIt\u2019s Xu Haozhe\u2019s birthday party today. We can\u2019t come empty-handed for the meal right? Let\u2019s give him a red packet of a hundred Chinese yuan each, is everyone agreeable?\u201dThe group was fine with this proposal, but Yun Yi who stood among them felt alienated.One hundred Chinese yuan was not a small figure to him. He was currently cornered in a tough spot.The boy seemed to have had an opinion about Yun Yi for a long time, as he suddenly turned to the latter and said with a chuckle, \u201cYun Yi, you don\u2019t have to spend anything. You\u2019re poor, all of us know that you won\u2019t be able to afford it. You\u2019re best friends with Haozhe anyway, he won\u2019t mind.\u201dHis words was a blatant provocation.You can also listen onLiked it?

Standing among the others, he was still the most outstanding, given his tall build and good looks.However, this gave rise to jealousy among the other boys in his class.This was because the majority of the girls in class would cast their eyes on Yun Yi with blushed cheeks, not sparing the other boys even a glance.The boy who spoke just now was the one who despised Yun Yi the most in class, Wu Bing.Wu Bing was an average-looking teenager. He was plump and had a full face of zits, his only redeeming feature was his height.His family was rather well-off, inevitably causing him to feel pompous and more superior to the others. He was usually snobbish and overweening.The majority of Yun Yi\u2019s classmates came from this very city and were quite wealthy.Xu Haozhe had invited the entire class to his birthday party, although there were plenty of them who did not come.Nonetheless, Yun Yi and Xu Haozhe were best friends. The former could not possibly miss it.Given the fact that most of the classmates who attended the gathering today were rich kids. Wu Bing took the opportunity and devised this idea with the sole purpose of embarrassing Yun Yi.Truthfully, Yun Yi was at a loss from Wu Bing\u2019s words.After all, it was his best friend\u2019s birthday party. Although Xu Haozhe had told him ceaselessly to not buy him any presents and that only his presence and sincerity mattered, the other classmates who came with him gifted red pockets.Instead it was him, who was usually the closest to Xu Haozhe, that became a freeloader who did not give a single cent.How could he?In spite of it, Yun Yi was really penniless. At most, he had a few Chinese yuan and even that took months to save.The reality was his family condition was poor. He was basically staying at someone else\u2019s home - how could he have any more money?Wu Bing laughed inwardly. He was planning to see Yun Yi\u2019s embarrassment.\u201cBig brother!\u201dA crisp and clear voice sounded timely. It was melodious like the angel.A girl who was about fifteen years old was seen walking down from the spiral staircase.She was dressed averagely, while a woman wearing a hat followed her.It was the girl\u2019s pretty face that perked up everyone.Yun Jian walked over to Yun Yi and flashed him a smile, disregarding the rest of his classmates. \u201cBig bro, why are you here too?\u201d\u201cXiao Jian?\u201d Astonished, Yun Yi had wanted to ask Yun Jian the same question only for her to speak first.\u201cIt\u2019s Zhe\u2019s birthday today. He\u2019s hosting a party at the restaurant for everyone here. Our class has come to celebrate with him.\u201d Yun Yi\u2019s nerves were slightly soothed the moment he saw his baby sister.With what happened previously, he even felt that there was nothing unachievable with his sister here.\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Yun Jian pretended to only just understand the situation and nodded before flashing a grin. \u201cThen he probably won\u2019t mind if I bring my friend along for a free meal, right?\u201dYun Jian stepped aside to introduce Snake.Lizard as she spoke.The group of teenagers could not help rolling their eyes when they heard her.They had witnessed shameless people before, but not to this extent. She was asking to be a freeloader herself!Surprised as he had never met Snake.Lizard, Yun Yi looked at Yun Jian. \u201cXiao Jian, this is\u2026\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s my friend,\u201d answered Yun Jian with a squint.\u201cYun Yi, is this your younger sister?\u201d Having been interrupted by Yun Jian when his scheme was about to succeed, Wu Bing could feel his teeth gritting together as he looked down at Yun Yi.Before he got Yun Yi\u2019s reply, he continued impatiently. \u201cYun Yi, is your sister bringing her friend to the party too? It\u2019s not - not too considerate, isn\u2019t it? Xu Haozhe is being nice, treating all of us to a meal. It\u2019s fine that you didn\u2019t contribute towards his gift money, but now you\u2019re inviting two more people\u2026\u201dAs his words faded to a stop, Wu Bing\u2019s implication was clear.He was reminding Yun Yi that his sister and her friend were freeloaders too when he was already leeching off Xu Haozhe.You can also listen onLiked it?

He smirked viciously, without any guilt from saying something so harsh, and continued exaggeratedly as if he was being a charitable person. \u201cNever mind, forget it. I think I\u2019ll just pay on behalf of you guys for the gift money too!\u201dHe then fished out a wallet made of genuine leather from his pants pocket and pulled out three one-hundred Chinese yuan bills.When he did so, he kept an eye out for everyone\u2019s gaze. He made sure to put on a show as if he was actually superior to everyone else.\u201cWow, Wu Bing, your wallet is made of authentic leather, right? That\u2019s so cool! This design hasn\u2019t even come to market yet!\u201d One of the boys with thick-framed glasses exclaimed.His words made Wu Bing more boastful.Holding the hundred yuan bills in his hand, Wu Bing was not in a hurry to humiliate Yun Yi. Instead, he was full of himself from flaunting his possessions that his gaze towards the others changed.\u201cThis wallet was my birthday present this year from my uncle. It\u2019s imported from France.\u201d Wu Bing lifted his head up proudly when he boasted.He then turned to look at Yun Yi to thrust the three yuan bills in front of him, it was like he treated his gesture as charitable. \u201cTake them, you don\u2019t have to return it!\u201d His tone was supercilious.It was like three one-hundred Chinese yuan was nothing in his eyes, highlighting the fact that his family was wealthy.Yun Yi clenched his fists. He was so close to hurling a punch, aggravated from how Wu Bing humiliated him. However, he held himself back.\u201cKeep your money. We don\u2019t need it!\u201d Yun Yi spat through gritted teeth.They were poor but even then, they had dignity!\u201cOh ho, Yun Yi, I\u2019m kind enough to help you out of your predicament. Why won\u2019t you accept it?\u201d Wu Bing instead accused Yun Yi of burning bridges.There was a hint of glowering from Yun Yi\u2019s expression.Watching her elder brother being bullied, Yun Jian would definitely not sit around.Snake.Lizard who stood behind Yun Jian finally understood the whole story. She kept quiet as well, waiting for the girl\u2019s instruction.\u201cWe have to chip in gift money if we\u2019re staying for dinner, is that so?\u201d Yun Jian blinked, talking on Yun Yi\u2019s behalf.\u201cEveryone\u2019s chipping in some money. You guys won\u2019t actually sponge off the dinner, yeah? Little girl, your big brother isn\u2019t accepting my good deed. Why don\u2019t you take this money on behalf of him?\u201d Wu Bing told Yun Jian in a condescending tone while waving the three hundred Chinese yuan bills in his hand.To Wu Bing, he only had one goal, that was to humiliate Yun Yi.The means to do so were not important!Obviously, he had also assumed Yun Jian to be a peasant girl who would perk up when offered money.\u201cOf course we\u2019ll chip in the red packet too!\u201d Yun Jian smiled at Wu Bing showing her pearly teeth.Thinking that Yun Jian accepted his bait, Wu Bing quickly shoved the bills, used to shame Yun Yi, toward Yun Jian and looked at the boy disdainfully. \u201cThen take it quickly!\u201dIn his subconscious, he believed Yun Yi\u2019s family was in no financial condition to put three hundred Chinese yuan on the table in a flash!Yun Jian suddenly reeled in her bright smile, which was replaced with an icy shadow. She turned slightly without looking at the expression of the teenagers, glimpsing at Snake.Lizard\u2019s purse before turning back to face them.\u201cOne hundred Chinese yuan per person isn\u2019t good enough, is it? We got to make it one thousand each at least?\u201dYun Jian called Snake.Lizard after that. \u201cLiz.\u201dHaving worked with Yun Jian for so long, Snake.Lizard knew exactly what she meant.She opened her purse and took out three stacks of hundred Chinese yuan bills!She had the habit of bringing cash with her and Yun Jian knew it.Watching the group anticipatingly watching the drama unfold, and then being in a state of bafflement; she then recalled how her elder brother was being bullied. Yun Jian did not restrain herself.Even if she could not tell Qin Yirou the truth, she must let her elder brother imply a few certainties.Yun Jian looked at the astounded Wu Bing who held the three lone notes and chuckled coldly. \u201cOne thousand each, no need to return it!\u201dThe same words were repeated right back at Wu Bing.You can also listen onLiked it?

That meant her purse was filled with cash!The commodity price during this time was very low. It was considerably impressive for a student like Wu Bing to even be able to present one hundred Chinese yuan.At the very least, the parents of these students were high-ranking officials or tycoons. They could produce one hundred Chinese yuan but one thousand Chinese yuan was not a small figure.One thousand Chinese yuan could cover an average person\u2019s cost of living for a very long time!That was why everyone was flabbergasted as they witnessed what happened. Their eyes were close to falling from how wide they were stretched.Yun Yi was poor, so his younger sister must be poor too.Yet how did the friend of his baby sister have so much money in her purse?More importantly, why did the woman listen to the girl so obediently?\u201cXiao Jian, you\u2026\u201d Yun Yi\u2019s eyes were widened in disbelief as he stared at Yun Jian, and Snake.Lizard who was behind her.His baby sister was becoming more mysterious.She had unexplainable skills and an enigmatic friend\u2026Why did it feel like he understood her less and less?They were biological siblings who had grown up together, yet Yun Yi felt like it was the first time he had gotten to know Yun Jian as he stood dazed on the spot.Yun Jian shot him a reassuring gaze but did not explain further.Simultaneously, Wu Bing felt like running away.His hand that gripped the three one-hundred Chinese yuan bills, with the assumption that he could humiliate Yun Yi, were sweating. When his eyes fell on the three slabs of cash in Snake.Lizard\u2019s hand, he felt defeated.In retrospect, he must have been laughable now.A male voice then sounded just in time to lift the tense atmosphere. \u201cYi, all of you, you guys are here. Come on up. We\u2019ve been waiting for you!\u201dRight at the top of the spiral staircase stood Xu Haozhe dressed in a dandy suit. He descended down with his tall muscular build and a charming face that paralleled Yun Yi\u2019s good looks.When he saw Yun Jian, Xu Haozhe was taken aback. He then ran to her despite everyone\u2019s surprise and looked at her in adulation. \u201cYun Yi\u2019s sis, you\u2019re here too! Come, come. C\u2019mon, let\u2019s go up and have a seat. I\u2019m so happy that you could grace my birthday party with your presence!\u201dXu Haozhe\u2019s reaction perplexed everyone.Why was the girl regarded so highly of by Xu Haozhe?In addition to what happened just now, it seemed the story behind this girl was not as simple as she looked like!Yun Yi\u2019s younger sister was extraordinary!\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian flashed Xu Haozhe a smile and recovered to her usual state.She then pointed at the three stacks of banknotes in Snake.Lizard\u2019s hand and told Xu Haozhe. \u201cThis is from everyone to you.\u201dShe was really gifting it to him? That was thirty thousand Chinese yuan!The teenagers had only known that Yun Jian took out the thirty thousand Chinese yuan to vent for her elder brother, but they did not expect her to really give it away.Thirty thousand Chinese yuan was no joke!\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Xu Haozhe glanced at the present and was shocked.\u201cKeep it,\u201d Yun Jian told him with a wink.Xu Haozhe who was still astonished thought that it was really a gift from his classmates and felt that they were really generous. Therefore, he accepted the gift money without hesitation.Wu Bing looked like he ate a frog.After all, he was the one who had suggested this gift idea. They had the money. Even if they really wanted to chip in one thousand Chinese yuan per person, it was a little much, but it would give them good face.In spite of it, Yun Jian\u2019s action was like a big invisible slap that mortified him.You can also listen onLiked it?

This meant that the rest of the tables served another purpose.Yun Jian was currently seated between her brother Yun Yi and Snake.Lizard.Xu Haozhe sat on the right of Yun Yi. Four of them were lined along the same table.\u201cThe dishes are already ordered. I told the servers to serve us first. My dad\u2019s business partners will come later as well. Don\u2019t fret, we\u2019ll just chat among ourselves!\u201d Xu Haozhe told his chattering classmates after he seated himself down.To the others, Xu Haozhe\u2019s family was powerful and rich as his father was a businessman.In spite of it, Yun Jian knew that Xu Haozhe was the son of Longmen City\u2019s top mafia boss.When he said \u201cmy dad\u2019s business partners\u201d, he probably meant people also involved with gangsters.By inviting his son\u2019s classmates, Xu Haozhe\u2019s father was obviously leveraging his son\u2019s birthday party to strengthen his connections with his peers who could be resourceful to him.After all, a gang depended not only on itself, should it wish to survive and develop in the long term.Yun Yi similarly knew about his best friend\u2019s identity, opting to remain silent.From the moment he became best friends with Xu Haozhe, the pair never picked on each other\u2019s identities!After a while, the dishes were served.The servers delivered the dishes one after another while the teenagers enjoyed themselves.To have a meal in the Glittery Gold Hotel, after all, was a costly experience. Even though most of them were wealthy, it was impossible for them to dine here often. Otherwise, they would have gone beggarly soon.Yun Jian sat in her spot and specifically picked large chunks of meat to feed herself.Her physical strength was lacking, so she had to consume high energy foods.Training by purely running was no longer adequate.\u201cXiao Jian, eat slowly. Nobody\u2019s fighting with you!\u201d Yun Yi cracked a smile and wiped away the crumbs on the corner of his sister\u2019s lips.\u201cHahaha, Mayor Gu, here please!\u201d A loud tenor male voice rang from the door.A group of middle-aged men between their thirties to forties entered the VIP hall. The two standing in the front were well-dressed men, while behind them the rest were greeting each other courteously, appearing powerful and authoritative.They had obviously taken today as a gathering to network and extend their forces.Those who filed in later looked gentlemanly and lofty like they were chiefs in their field.Yun Jian narrowed her eyes and turned to look at Snake.Lizard, seeing that she was also discreetly pressing her lips together when she saw the first man who entered among the group.The middle-aged man was none other than the man who was conversing with Snake.Lizard, when Yun Jian encountered her downstairs.More surprisingly, Xu Haozhe walked to the man and called him, \u201cDad!\u201dThe middle-aged man was Xu Haozhe\u2019s father, the top mafia boss of Longmen City, Xu Zetian!Xu Zetian was distinctly the most respected person standing in the group, however not too long ago, he was asking for help from Snake.Lizard pleadingly!You can also listen onLiked it?

His position was one of the highest ranks among Longmen City\u2019s officials and his political stature in the city was remarkable as well.It was not at all strange for Xu Zetian to have contact with government officers as a mafia boss.Yun Jian narrowed her eyes while she watched the entourage of middle-aged men walk in.Xu Zetian did not notice Snake.Lizard and Yun Jian here. He was nodding at his son, Xu Haozhe, with a smile before he stepped into the hall with Mayor Gu and sat themselves down on an empty steamboat table.The others followed suit.These people were either high-ranking officials, gang members, or tycoons. Their social statuses were not lowly. As expected, they blended in swiftly and found acquaintances who could bring them some sort of advantage. Familiarizing each other, they sought win-win cooperations.This was the purpose of their presence at the gathering. It was not for the birthday of Xu Zetian\u2019s son.Xu Haozhe was somewhat disheartened. His father did not even wish him a happy birthday. Even his birthday party was a guise for the man to expand his influence.Although it was the same every year, it still felt like his favorite toy being cruelly crushed right in front of himself, yet he could only watch helplessly when every piece of anticipation of his ended up in disappointment each time.Xu Haozhe could only push his emotions deeper into himself lest others noticed his low spirits.\u201cZhe, happy birthday!\u201d It was as if Yun Yi had discovered Xu Haozhe\u2019s forlorn gaze as he placed his hand on the latter\u2019s broad shoulders, a sense of comfort at this juncture of time.\u201cHappy birthday!\u201dWith Yun Yi leading, the rest of their classmates wished Xu Haozhe respectively.The boy pressed his lips together. He was genuinely touched as the emotion in his eyes could not be feigned. His voice got a little raspy. \u201cThank you guys\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, we\u2019re all old friends. What are you thanking us for? It\u2019s what we should do!\u201d Someone grumbled.Yet it only served to move Xu Haozhe even deeper.Following the rest, Yun Jian wished the boy a happy birthday as well, but her attention was actually on Xu Zetian.Snake.Lizard had told her about the latter\u2019s identity, including why she had met with him.What Yun Jian did not expect was that Xu Zetian was actually a member of the Gu Sha Mercenaries.It was just that his influence within Gu Sha Mercenaries was immensely limited.To explain with an example, members of Gu Sha Mercenaries were scattered across the globe. There were at least a few hundred thousand of them. Among these people, they were divided into groups like intel, assassination, investigation, and so on.Xu Zetian was only a tiny force that Gu Sha Mercenaries had distributed in Longmen City.As the boss of Gu Sha Mercenaries in her past life and having left everything to Tiger.Leopard and Snake.Lizard to manage, it was not unusual for Yun Jian to have no idea of Xu Zetian\u2019s presence.While Xu Zetian was a member of the organization, it would be like an ordinary person wanting to meet the president if he intended to see Yun Jian.Such was life, however, who would know that Yun Jian was actually here in Longmen City and in her current rebirthed state?There was a sudden crash when Xu Zetian, who was seated not too far from them, dropped the wine glass in his hand, causing it to shatter.He had been conversing with Mayor Gu but his composure dissolved in an instant.It was because he saw Snake.Lizard when he looked up. In a panic, he abandoned Mayor Gu while disregarding what everyone else would make of that and walked toward her.The men were flummoxed indeed. Xu Zetian had left the influential mayor to go over to a woman? What was he going to do?They then heard Xu Zetian carefully asking Snake.Lizard, \u201cYou\u2019re here too? Why didn\u2019t you say so? Do you want to sit over there?\u201dWho was the woman? Why was she prioritized over the mayor?Mayor Gu himself was as surprised as the rest.Snake.Lizard turned to look at Yun Jian, waiting for her opinion.As she did so, everyone shifted their gaze to Yun Jian.The woman whom Xu Zetian was reverent of was taking orders from Yun Jian?You can also listen onLiked it?

Although she was dressed averagely, there was a commanding aura from her.This girl was the one whom he met downstairs not too long ago. He had thought that she got lost in the wrong place and asked her to leave them alone\u2026What was going on now?Snake.Lizard was highly ranked upon the Gu Sha Mercenaries that he was also a part of. The particulars of what position she held, Xu Zetian had no right of knowing. He only knew that Snake.Lizard held a significant position in the organization.Even then, Xu Zetian could only fantasize Snake.Lizard\u2019s stature. Yet a personage like her had to bow down to Yun Jian?Who was this girl?If Xu Zetian were to know that Snake.Lizard was one of the founding executives of the Gu Sha Mercenaries, his legs would have given up on him on the spot.Then, if he were to know that the harmless looking Yun Jian was the organization\u2019s big boss, he would absolutely pass out and need to be sent to the hospital.Nonetheless, Xu Zetian did not know either of these secrets.Such was life\u2026 Xu Zetian was Longmen City\u2019s top mafia boss who was basically one of the most powerful and dominant figures in the city, but within the Gu Sha Mercenaries, he could not even find out who the boss of the organization was.\u201cUh\u2026 sure.\u201d Xu Zetian rubbed a hand over his mouth and bowed several times to Yun Jian and Snake.Lizard before slowly walking back to Mayor Gu with a tensed body.\u201cWow, Yun Yi, your baby sis knows Xu Haozhe\u2019s father?\u201d A girl who sat at the same table asked Yun Yi in surprise once Xu Zetian left, obviously just wanting to strike up a conversation with the boy.Yun Yi was popular in class, especially liked by the girls.He was sincere to everyone and had a gentle mannerism.\u201cUh, I don\u2019t know either.\u201d Yun Yi glanced awkwardly at Yun Jian and Snake.Lizard in an attempt to divert the topic.He would love to know why Xiao Jian\u2019s friend knew Zhe\u2019s father too!Others did not know, but Yun Yi was well aware that Xu Haozhe\u2019s father was no exemplary businessman. He was a mafia boss!Xiao Jian\u2019s friend knew the mafia boss and what was more, the mafia boss was reverent of her. Even when he was talking to someone as important as Mayor Gu, he could leave him and come over to greet her!Yet the culprit of everyone\u2019s doubt, Yun Jian, was currently devouring the plate of meat in front of her.\u201cBurp\u2026\u201d At the receiving end of everyone\u2019s anticipating stares, expecting her to give some sort of explanation, Yun Jian burped.\u201cI\u2019m full.\u201d Yun Jian stroked her tummy and grinned sweetly at them.Everyone\u2019s smile froze, a little while a huge wave of shock washed through them.That was all? No explanation?After the meal, it was already night time.However, no one was in a hurry to go home.Xu Haozhe suggested with a chuckle, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the new arcade and hang out for a bit? I heard that they got a new shooting simulation game there, the gun controller is like a real gun!\u201dHe turned to look at Yun Jian as he spoke.Even until now, Xu Haozhe could not forget the scene of Yun Jian counter-firing the sniper.You can also listen onLiked it?

He had suggested going for the shooting game because of Yun Jian. When she killed the sniper that day, she looked just like a sharpshooter!Otherwise, he would not be going to the arcade for some simulated game-gun. He was someone with a real gun, after all. The simulated pistol in the arcade was scoff-worthy.Other than those tagging along, some of Yun Yi\u2019s classmates decided to head home, especially Wu Bing. After Yun Jian defeated him, he had wanted to leave since then. Now that dinner was over, he had slipped away a long time ago.Snake.Lizard was not planning to go to some children\u2019s playground, so Yun Jian tossed her the car key to Si Yi\u2019s Lamborghini and had her drive the car back. She would take it back the next day.Snake.Lizard hummed her agreement and turned to leave with the key.Minus those who left, there were about a dozen of them. A few girls had stayed to spend more time with either Yun Yi or Xu Haozhe.Both the latter were considered immensely good looking in their school. The girls usually did not have much opportunity to come in contact with them.\u201cLet\u2019s walk there following the street. It\u2019s not very far, it\u2019s at the turn two streets down!\u201d Xu Haozhe pointed ahead and said.\u201cSure,\u201d Yun Jian said with a nod.\u201cWe\u2019ll take it as a stroll!\u201d Xu Haozhe chuckled.The group of teenagers then sauntered along the city\u2019s street.The city night was beautiful. The sky that Yun Jian could see was illuminated by the city\u2019s neon lights while passersby brushed past them.When the breeze blew with the chill of an autumn night, the refreshing wind was somehow frosty as Yun Jian was wearing short sleeves.Yun Yi took off his jacket and draped it on Yun Jian, saying with a smile, \u201cPut it on, Xiao Jian. Don\u2019t catch a cold.\u201dHe was always loving towards his younger sister. It was like that since they were kids.Yun Jian took a slight pause. She was not actually cold. Enduring all sorts of hardship in her previous life, this breezy wind now was really insignificant.In spite of it, a warmth spread in the bottom of her heart. She could not help thinking about her baby brother from her past life.If he were still here, would he be this nice to her?\u201cThank you.\u201d Yun Jian pressed her lips together. She did not return the jacket to Yun Yi. Instead, she wrapped it around herself.Yun Yi beamed and ruffled Yun Jian\u2019s hair.The group soon arrived at the arcade that was located on the second floor of a tower.Tall towers were scarce in 1998\u2019s Longmen City. Such structures were only beginning to pick up the trend. This also signified the current status of Longmen City\u2019s central.When Yun Jian and the other teenagers entered the arcade on the second level, they saw the simulation shooting game which had a huge screen. The biggest crowd was gathered in front of said machine, mostly made up of youths.\u201cI\u2019ll go get the tokens. Hold on!\u201d Xu Haozhe left with his words.You can also listen onLiked it?

To her, the shooting games and whatnot here were a little childish.The storms of bullets and shells that she had been through in her past life did not lack in comparison to the scenes available in the simulation game machine.\u201cI\u2019m back!\u201d Xu Haozhe ran back from the counter holding a big pile of game tokens. He then distributed them to everyone.There were a lot of people gathered in front of the simulation shooting machine as it was the venue\u2019s newest addition. Even the gun controller was similar in weight to a real gun. Although the player would only shoot at the huge screen, the effect was quite like shooting a real gun.Students of this era were eager to give it a try, thus there were masses of people both watching and playing the game.\u201cHah, looks like we\u2019ll have to wait for a bit. There are too many of them waiting to play!\u201d Xu Haozhe said, stroking his head.Guns and cars were always the boys\u2019 preference, but girls were different. Other than Yun Jian, the other girls from their group had gone to play different arcade games together, those that appealed to young girls like claw machines.Simultaneously, a band of youths exclaimed boisterously in front of the simulation shooting machine.Standing at the front of the game was a young man in his twenties. He put down the pistol controller wearing a victorious smirk.The shooting game was played by aiming and shooting the targets on screen with the gun controller.Without a doubt, the controller had no bullets. It only provided a visual effect of hitting the target on the screen. Nonetheless, discounting the fact that it contained no ammunition, the gun controller\u2019s feel and grip were akin to the real weapon.Therefore, the launch of this machine instantly attracted the attention and welcoming of flocks of youths who liked guns.\u201cWow, Bro Lei is amazing. It does make a difference that you\u2019ve held a real pistol before. You struck thirty-two targets in a minute!\u201d A guy who stood not too far away sang praises to the guy holding the gun controller.It was as if they were worried that other people wouldn\u2019t know that this young man in his twenties had held a genuine gun!As expected, the crowd exclaimed and gasped when they heard the revelation.Bro Lei was incredibly flattered, thinking he was superior.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You guys have never held a real gun. The real deal is still different from this toy!\u201d Brother Lei crowed, tipping his chin so high that his nose was going to point above his eye level.\u201cAre you guys done? Can you move if you are?\u201d Xu Haozhe stepped forward and asked when he saw the group not moving away nor continuing to play after the round.Brother Lei who was still bathing in the crowd\u2019s adoration and applause glared at Xu Haozhe at once.\u201cWhere the f*ck did you come from, you bastard child? How dare you fight for the game with me?\u201d Brother Lei clenched his fists and bumped them together in a challenging manner. There was a swagger in his provocation, reflecting how conceited he felt.It was as if he was saying \u201cI\u2019ll beat you up if you say another word\u201d.Xu Haozhe opened his mouth to retort. He had just asked a question, yet the other party was beginning to shout at him angrily. However, Yun Jian spoke faster than him, while mercilessly stepping on the other party\u2019s pride. \u201cHitting only thirty-two targets in one minute, your shooting stance is flashy but garish. You should move!\u201dThe mass was astonished by Yun Jian\u2019s harsh critique that hit every pretentious spot of Brother Lei.The latter looked enraged.What the f*ck, where did this group of people come from?You can also listen onLiked it?

Therefore, he felt very supercilious, having held a real gun before.He felt even more prominent when he played the shooting game, like he was standing on top of the world, overlooking a group of kids who had never even seen a real pistol. It was as if he had an elevated status.In addition, the shooting simulation game had just been released. It was already impressive that he could strike thirty-two moving targets on screen within one minute!It was the highest record on the machine!In spite of it, Yun Jian had butted in and criticized his assumed superiority as well as belittled him when he was proudly blowing his own trumpet.How could Brother Lei stay quiet about it?He did not care that Yun Jian was a girl. He growled back at her, \u201cWhere did you kids f*cking come from? Do you know who I am? How dare you try to snatch this game? Tsk, are you bored of being alive?\u201dHe then pointed at Yun Jian viciously. \u201cF*ck you, does my shooting skill require a rascal\u2019s comments? Give it a go if you\u2019re so smart!\u201dBrother Lei was a frequent patron of the arcade and a thug on the streets. He was good in games, thus he was respectfully referred to as the \u201cKing of Games\u201d in the clique.He had subconsciously thought that he was the king of the arcade too. Any arcade games that he had played, he would be the one to renew the highest score!This was why he had overbearingly challenged Yun Jian.He was not ready to believe that a young little girl could defeat him.The boys from Yun Yi\u2019s class who had tagged along were now worried. They did not expect Xu Haozhe and Yun Jian to be at loggerheads with someone the moment they came to the arcade.In addition, Brother Lei looked menacing, like you would be doomed if you provoked him. What should they do?Yun Jian cracked a smile, unintimidated by Brother Lei\u2019s daunting character. Instead, her smile was amused as she sneered, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll have a go. Move.\u201dSeeing that Yun Jian was not scared and was going against his challenge, Brother Lei\u2019s gang was stunned.Brother Lei himself was startled too and took a double take at the girl.Yun Jian wore clean clothes, although it was apparent that her garments came from roadside vendors. Her gaze and demeanor, however, exuded a distinct aura.Was this an illusion? Brother Lei shook his head. This was just a little girl who liked to outshine others!\u201cAlright, c\u2019mon, have a go you punk! Just for what you said, if you didn\u2019t hit as many targets as I did this round, you have to take off your clothes and kneel down before my brothers! Hmph!\u201d Brother Lei glowered in his threat.\u201cXiao Jian, don\u2019t\u2026\u201d Yun Yi was anxious, panicking when he saw his baby sister going up against people like Brother Lei and his gang who were obvious thugs.These people could do anything!Before Yun Yi said anything louder, Xu Haozhe pulled him back.\u201cYi, trust your sister! Don\u2019t you want to see her limit?\u201d Xu Haozhe said softly to Yun Yi looking at the aforementioned girl.The shooting game could test a person\u2019s shooting skills. This was the ulterior reason for Xu Haozhe to trick Yun Jian here.He wanted to know the marksmanship level of Yun Jian who could counter-strike a sniper!Yun Jian wore a grin that raised goosebumps. She told Brother Lei flatly, \u201cAfter I win, you\u2019ll have one arm broken!\u201dShe would not let those who sexully harassed her off the hook so lightly.What an unnerving tone!

In fact, he was already fantasizing about her nude state.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to win first!\u201d He looked at Yun Jian condescendingly with a scoff.How could he take her threat just now seriously? Even his gang of brothers wouldn\u2019t give a second thought for the girl\u2019s words.What a joke! How could Brother Lei lose to an underage girl?Consequently, he was impatient to see Yun Jian lose and cry begging for mercy, but would still be undressed by them.It was not like his gang was unfamiliar with crude deeds like this.They were thugs. They had committed a lot of nasty deeds. They would usually just grab whichever woman they set their eyes on. If they failed, they would drug her and force themselves on her. It would always work out.Yun Jian was pretty, it was a visible fact. Actually, when she had first locked horns with Brother Lei, the rest of his gang had been checking her out.It was also the reason Yun Yi was fretful. How could he remain oblivious when his baby sister was being undressed by the eyes of a gang?\u201cCome on, little girl. Why are you still standing there? You wouldn\u2019t be afraid now, would you?\u201d One of the guys from Brother Lei\u2019s gang could not help urging when he saw that Yun Jian was not in front of the arcade machine yet.Yun Jian scoffed. She threw the handful of tokens in her palm into the air and caught them charismatically before she took one out and passed the remaining tokens to Yun Yi.\u201cBig bro, hold these for me,\u201d she told him.\u201cXiao Jian, don\u2019t force yourself!\u201d Yun Yi bit his lips and finally said worriedly.Despite the fact that Yun Jian counter-killed the sniper that day, he was still worried for the girl as her elder brother.\u201cMm.\u201d Yun Jian flashed him a smile feeling warmth spread within her.It felt great to have someone supporting her.Before Yun Jian made her way to the shooting game, she turned to look at Xu Haozhe and smiled showing her teeth. \u201cWatch carefully now.\u201dLeaving the vague words, she went to her destination.Xu Haozhe was flummoxed.Yun Jian had discovered why he had brought her here? Xu Haozhe spoke to Yun Yi in a whisper just now. He did not expect the girl to have found out.That was why she asked him to watch carefully.Xu Haozhe felt his cheeks heating up immediately, embarrassed that Yun Jian had exposed him.Musing, he consoled himself that it was fine. He just wanted to know how skilled she was. What was wrong about that?!While Xu Haozhe was occupied with his thoughts, Yun Jian who was in front of the game machine was not in a hurry to insert the token. She picked up the gun controller and bounced it in her hand.The spectators were bewildered by her action. What was she doing?Yun Jian was checking the difference of the gaming console from the real gun.She weighed it momentarily as she inserted the token.A string of English words popped up on screen promptly. The Chinese subtitle reading \u201cShoot-out starts!\u201dThe game has begun! Yun Jian narrowed her eyes while the spectators held their breath.One after another shooting target moved from the side on the screen.As the targets moved, a steady rhythm of shooting was heard from the machine\u2019s speaker.\u201cBang, bang, bang, bang, bang\u2026\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?

Players could usually still strike the targets with a constant pull of trigger at the screen, despite their lack of aim.Simply put, a fool knew how to work such a simple mechanism too! Unless someone was so stupid that they did not know where the trigger was.Whether the bullets could hit the moving targets on the screen, however, was another story of its own.When Yun Jian pulled the trigger of the gun controller, she looked just like any other person who kept firing at the huge screen.It did not seem unusual, until everyone noticed that the constant stream of \u201cbang\u201d meaning that each shot struck a moving target!The speedily moving targets that people usually could not catch in time to aim, were being shot by Yun Jian\u2019s controller without missing a beat!If an average person were to shoot the targets that popped out continuously, the influx of targets from the opposite side would have already disappeared by the time they aligned their aim. That would be considered a failure as they would miss the opportunity to shoot other targets.Yet each shot fired by Yun Jian was as if she had already known the positions of each target that appeared in multiples.Each pull of the trigger shot a target accurately. She managed to not miss a single target!\u201cThirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three! She got thirty-three targets!\u201d Someone could not help but shout, feeling fervent as they watched.It had only been less than ten seconds into the one-minute shoot-out.In less than ten seconds, Yun Jian had shot thirty-three shooting targets and overtaken Brother Lei!She was still firing shots!Oh gosh!Since she had begun shooting, the spectators went from disdain, to shock, and now to stupor.There were even people at the back who had started to cheer and whistle.Brother Lei blanched. When he was pompous and condescending to Yun Jian a few seconds ago, he now looked like he was just beaten up violently.Yun Yi felt like his emotions had just gone on a rollercoaster ride. Meanwhile, Xu Haozhe was currently suppressing the tremor that was threatening to rack through him. He shakily counted the moving targets on the screen that he could barely follow with his eyes, yet they were respectively shot down by Yun Jian.No matter how exaggerated the feelings of those around her were, the girl, who had a knee propped up in front of the shooting video game in the cliche shooting stance, remained unaffected.Her finger pulled the trigger swiftly as she raked the shooting targets on screen.When the game ended, the huge words appearing on the screen, and a string of digits pushed everyone\u2019s emotion to the climax.The red words that popped up on the monitor read \u201cHighest record\u201d with white digits below them that displayed \u201c203\u201d.Yun Jian had shot two hundred and three targets in one minute!\u201cOh my god! My eyes aren\u2019t deceiving me right! You could do that with a gun! This girl is so cool! Did you see her shooting stance just now? She\u2019s awesome!\u201d Some guys who loved firearms were nearly jumping in ecstasy from the scene he had just witnessed.Brother Lei who had shot thirty-two targets in a minute was already amazing, but Yun Jian shot two hundred and three targets in the same amount of time!Was there a need to compare their results?\u201cGodly sharpshooter! She\u2019s divine! Did you guys see? Not one of her bullets went astray! This girl is a godly sharpshooter!\u201d The crowd was rowdy and it attracted the other people from other arcade games.Yun Jian who had gently put down the simulated gun, stood up, and went to Brother Lei beaming.It was a beam but there was a piercing gleam hidden.

Crimes such as brawls and violence were part of their daily lives.Brother Lei had intended to let this episode end right here, he was at a loss after all, but Yun Jian was brash.Out of patriarchal ego, Brother Lei\u2019s face fell at once as he looked at Yun Jian and cussed, \u201cF*ck off, whose arm are you breaking? You stick figure kids? Do you want to fight?\u201dWas this raising the curtains for a brawl?Afraid of getting involved when they saw Brother Lei exploding in anger, the spectators hurriedly retreated a few steps.The little girl had won, but Brother Lei and the gang were never ones to keep their words.Furthermore, they had yet to lose in any fight they had gotten into.Brother Lei had support to back him up too!Rumors had it that Brother Lei and his gang had assaulted someone to the extent they were incapacitated for life. While they were taken into custody by the police, they were released without charges half a day later.How was that possible if not for a higher-ranking, influential alley covering up for them?Someone reminded Yun Jian kindly, \u201cLittle girl, leave quick! Don\u2019t push it!\u201dBrother Lei heard the whispers around them as well and felt his esteem boost. His malicious gaze locked on Yun Jian\u2019s face with a crude smirk. \u201cHmm\u2026 little girl, as long as you apologize to this big brother and be my company tonight, I will forgive you!\u201dAddressing himself as \u201cbig brother\u201d served only to disgust Yun Jian further.\u201cI only want your arm.\u201d Yun Jian wore a smile but it did not reach her eyes.\u201cWhat!\u201d It was like Brother Lei did not hear her clearly. He was baffled again at the teenage girl\u2019s audacity. He had given her an out but she was not taking it. Instead, she was going up against him face on?Xu Haozhe watched from the side quietly without the intention to step up and help Yun Jian.He was the son of Longmen City\u2019s mafia boss. If he were to disclose his identity, Brother Lei and his gang would cry begging for mercy. However, he watched on, squinting while wondering how Yun Jian would resolve the matter.Being held back by Xu Haozhe, Yun Yi was unable to stand guard before Yun Jian. Though, he knew that his best friend, Zhe, would definitely help out if Xiao Jian was unable to take the guys down. The thought provided him a slight sense of comfort.\u201cOh my gosh, this girl can shoot but calling out Brother Lei like that, is she voluntarily taking herself to hell?\u201d The crowd could not help muttering.\u201cShe\u2019s a pretty little girl, it\u2019s a pity that she\u2019ll be ruined anyway after facing Brother Lei!\u201d Someone in the crowd sighed whilst avoiding being heard by said man.So what if Yun Jian was a sharpshooter? To the spectators, Yun Jian was doomed meeting a hooligan like Brother Lei.\u201cLeft hand.\u201d Yun Jian scanned Brother Lei, unfazed by the latter\u2019s intimidating aura.\u201cWhat?\u201d Brother Lei was confused.He was not the only one. The others stunned on the spot, perplexed by her words as well.What left hand?Yun Jian already took two steps closer to Brother Lei.Her next course of action was simple yet extremely swift.Before Brother Lei and the gang could react, Yun Jian\u2019s hand wrapped around Brother Lei\u2019s left wrist lithe like a snake.\u201cCrack!\u201dA crisp crack of the bone rang.Before Brother Lei responded to the fact that Yun Jian was in front of him, his left arm was already broken by her.A sharp pain shot up and spread through his body as his moan broke out immediately.\u201cAh! Ah! My arm! \u2026\u201dIt took a mere three seconds.The spectators were stupefied.

Their eyes were wide like saucers.What made this girl so delicate again?Just because Brother Lei pointed a finger at her, she broke his entire arm!The tyrannical action shocked the crowd tremendously.She was a devil dozens of times scarier than Brother Lei!Yun Jian narrowed her sight and side-eyed Brother Lei\u2019s members who were gawking at her. She challenged with a smirk, \u201cStill here? Do you guys want to roll on the floor like him too?\u201dAs she spoke, she pointed at Brother Lei who was thrashing on the floor in agony, while she beamed like a blossoming flower.With Brother Lei as the precedence, the hooligans felt chills coursing through their spines upon meeting Yun Jian\u2019s grinning face as they heard what she said.How dare they stay here any longer?The gang carried Brother Lei who was still rolling around on the floor and vanished from the arcade in a flash.The two people who carried Brother Lei while they fled were nearly tripped by the door due to their haste. They managed to avoid falling and ran off even faster.Those who watched them laughed heartily.Who could have thought that Brother Lei and the gang were the ones fleeing in the end?Yun Jian\u2019s eyes shone as she turned to face Yun Yi and friends, asking, \u201cDo you guys still wanna play?\u201dThe teenagers shook their heads like a rattle drum.Hah, with the divine sharpshooter Yun Jian here, they would just be embarrassing themselves if they were to play!It was just that they were still surprised that Yun Yi\u2019s younger sister was so charismatic while beating up Brother Lei and his gang, in addition to being a sharpshooter!When Yun Jian broke Brother Lei\u2019s arm, no one had actually captured how she did it!\u2026Parting with Xu Haozhe and the rest of their classmates, Yun Yi and Yun Jian walked back to the mansion.It was around seven or eight o\u2019clock at night, a constant breeze was sweeping past them. Yun Yi who wore short sleeves, was shaking in the cold since he had given his jacket to Yun Jian.\u201cYun Yi, I was just moving around just now. I\u2019m still all warmed up. You can have back your jacket!\u201d Yun Jian took off the jacket and returned it to Yun Yi when she saw the boy shivering, not giving a chance for the boy to oppose.Yun Yi opened his mouth with the intention to retort, instead it split into a smile.His baby sister was concerned about him! How could he reject her kindness?Yun Yi quickly put on his jacket.Returning to the mansion, the house was brightly lit but the adults were not home yet.Dong Ruan was a government official and was usually home late. Sometimes, she would not even return home if work occupied her the entire night.Her son was fully entrusted to the private school\u2019s teachers, so he was rarely home as well.Qin Yirou had gotten a job as a restaurant waitress. Her wage was relatively higher than as a textile factory worker. In addition, she only had to serve and clean up the tables. It was just that she would finish work late, around ten o\u2019clock at night.Qin Yirou didn\u2019t have any qualifications, thus Dong Ruan could only allocate her a job at places like the restaurant.Now that Yun Jian, Yun Yi, and Qin Yirou were staying in Dong Ruan\u2019s house, it made the house feel livelier.\u201cXiao Jian, I\u2019m gonna rest up in my room. I\u2019m going back to school early in the morning tomorrow. We\u2019re having a monthly test in a few days. I can only fully concentrate on my revision if I\u2019m in school.\u201d Serious about studying, Yun Yi told Yun Jian once they arrived home and went upstairs to retire for the night.Not too long after Yun Yi left, a tall figure walked down. It was Si Yi.Yun Jian was about to explain when Si Yi\u2019s good looking lips parted to speak first. His first question surprisingly did not enquire about his car. \u201cYou just got home?\u201dSi Yi wore a slight frown when she saw Yun Jian\u2019s exposed arms. The short sleeves could hardly deter the cold.He took off his jacket and tossed it toward Yun Jian, saying aloofly, \u201cLayer up when it\u2019s cold at night. My aunt will blame me if you catch a cold!\u201dHis sculpted face tilted away as he spoke. His last words were obviously a lie he made up.He was confused as well. He was here to ask her for the car keys, was he not?You can also listen onLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: A New Company. New CruisePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationYun Jian was taken aback. Frozen for a brief second, she caught the jacket that Si Yi chucked her and slowly draped it on after a moment of hesitation. Then, she spoke dazedly, \u201cYour car is with my friend. I\u2019ll return it to you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cMm.\u201d Si Yi nodded and took a glance at Yun Jian with his deep eyes before turning around. Without a goodbye, his tall form disappeared from Yun Jian\u2019s view.Yun Jian was bemused once more. She pressed her dry lips together with a jerk on the corners of her lips.\u2026The next morning, Yun Jian asked Snake.Lizard to drive Si Yi\u2019s Lamborghini over and returned both the car and the car keys to him.Then, she headed out with Snake.Lizard.She had just settled down in Longmen City, however, the decision to start a company in the city was made a long time ago.Yun Jian was a person of determination and always kept her word. Since she had said so, she would definitely fulfill it without delay.Zhang Zhifan and his men were already transferred to Longmen City long before Yun Jian herself moved here. The group was currently staying at a rented house in Longmen City.Yun Jian had arranged this secretly, keeping it from the knowledge of Qin Yirou and Yun Yi.The current Country Z was only starting to develop its economy. The people\u2019s life was slowly progressing from poverty to moderate prosperity.In the past, people walked as a mode of transportation. It was gradually being replaced with bicycles and motorcycles during this era. To own a car as the means of transport, however, was only affordable by wealthy families.Nonetheless, as times changed, cars would be introduced sooner or later, thereby becoming the people\u2019s most convenient mode of transportation.This meant that one day, eventually, each household would be able to afford a car.Of course, Yun Jian had deduced this from the present circumstances and the future business trend, as well as completing a fact check.Some parts in the European and American regions, which were thriving economically and had a better standard of living, were already growing toward this direction.The reality proved that Yun Jian\u2019s deduction was accurate too, but this was of course, a revelation of the future.What Yun Jian had in mind to set up was a car dealership.The idea seemed outrageous. How could a girl who was not even eighteen open a shop that sold cars?Starting a company required capital. It was undeniable that Yun Jian had the money.She also had both local and overseas channels to import and export cars.In spite of it, Zhang Zhifan and the rest of his men jolted when Yun Jian pitched her business idea. They nearly passed out from the shock.\u201cWhat? You want to start a car - car - car\u2026 car dealership?\u201d When Zhang Zhifan stuttered the bombshell, his gaze at Yun Jian was incredulous.If one owned a motorcycle during this time, they could already flaunt it. Cars were the symbol of riches!Furthermore, to open a car dealership, they had to purchase the cars in bulk.Secondly, they needed working capital. Then, they had to submit relevant applications and possess a showroom.These were the necessary procedures.Yun Jian nodded and leaned against the corner of the table showing her long legs. She wore a natural smile when she told Zhang Zhifan, \u201cI told you, you don\u2019t have to worry about the capital. What you need to do is to fully operate this business for me.\u201dIt was impossible for Yun Jian to not seize the opportunity to make money when there was one.With investment comes return. Yun Jian would never set up a business that was bound to lose money.\u201cMe?\u201d Zhang Zhifan pointed at himself in a trance.\u201cYou.\u201d Yun Jian grinned. \u201cAnd the company will be registered under your name.\u201dAfter a pause, Yun Jian was glowing with confidence, causing Zhang Zhifan and his men to look at her with a renewed perspective.\u201cThe new company will be named\u2026\u201d Yun Jian looked up slightly to set her sight afar. Smiling, she said, \u201cNew Cruise.\u201dA new life, a new voyage. - New Cruise.You can also listen onLiked it? Take a second to support Novels on Patreon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Money Makes The World Go RoundPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis chapter is updated by wuxiaworld.euTranslator: EndlessFantasy Translation Editor: EndlessFantasy TranslationZhang Zhifan was completely befuddled. He did not expect Yun Jian to trust him so much.Yun Jian was bearing all the capital funds, and he did not have to be concerned with the process of starting the company, yet his name was to take full credit when the company was being registered.This was a godsend that one could rarely encounter in life!At the same time, Zhang Zhifan stood firm on one belief in his mind. - Whether Yun Jian could succeed in the endeavor or not, he would remain loyal!\u201cSis Jian, don\u2019t worry! I, Zhang Zhifan, guarantee with my head, that I\u2019ll do my best!\u201d Zhang Zhifan declared seriously.Since he was subdued by Yun Jian that day, Zhang Zhifan and his men had seen Yun Jian as their boss and had been referring to her as \u201cSis Jian\u201d.If Zhang Zhifan became the chief of the company, his men would naturally become the company\u2019s founding members.The group of ex-gangsters looked at Yun Jian fervently and spoke simultaneously, \u201cSis Jian, we promise you our allegiance and swear to stay with you till the end!\u201dYun Jian smiled with a nod and told Zhang Zhifan, \u201cSubmit the application form for the company as soon as possible and keep an eye out for a store location. Let me know when you\u2019ve found the place. You don\u2019t have to worry about the other matters.\u201d\u201cMm!\u201d Zhang Zhifan nodded.Leaving the men\u2019s rental, Yun Jian and Snake.Lizard walked along the pavement.\u201cYou still love money like you used to. You already own a few international enterprises, but you never miss an opportunity to make money,\u201d Snake.Lizard teased while walking beside Yun Jian, despite her staying silent just now.Yun Jian suddenly cracked a grin and side-eyed Snake.Lizard with a tinge of a young girl\u2019s guile. \u201cMoney makes the world go round. Who doesn\u2019t want money?\u201dSnake.Lizard had an aloof temperament, yet she could not help a tug at her lips upon hearing what Yun Jian said.\u2026Yun Jian returned to school on Monday.Establishing a business could not be hastened, especially the procedure of the application.Yun Jian was currently seated in the class for her lesson.She twirled the black pen in her palm out of boredom while she looked around leisurely.Once class was dismissed, both jokesters, Chen Xinyi and Zhang Shaofeng, sprang to her.\u201cHey, master, it\u2019s been so many days. Shouldn\u2019t you be teaching your pupil something amazing, no? Ah, like what you did previously, knowing that I was going to trip you without looking at the floor, yet also having the time to kick me instead. That was so cool!\u201d Zhang Shaofeng stuck his handsome face closer, speaking to Yun Jian in veneration.Chen Xinyi shoved the boy away and laughed. \u201cIgnore him! Let him be! Jian Jian, let\u2019s talk!\u201dSince Yun Jian had transferred to Yi High\u2019s Class A, people had been trying to find faults within her. However, they were all thwarted by Zhang Shaofeng and Chen Xinyi, making life easy for her.Nevertheless, troubles still came her way sometimes even when she was not looking for any.Yun Jian noticed that a heated gaze had been trained on her for a long time now, although she pretended not to notice.The owner of the gaze seemed to have lost her patience as she walked toward Yun Jian.Lu Rongrong asked roughly, \u201cHey, who\u2019s the one who picked you up from school last Friday?\u201dLu Rongrong could not be blamed. Si Yi was too charming for his own good. His impeccable charisma and handsome features had bewitched plenty of girls.Yun Jian glanced up at Lu Rongrong before ducking back down to look at Chen Xinyi without regarding her.Riled up from the reaction, Lu Rongrong grabbed a book from Yun Jian\u2019s desk and hurled it against her table in a tantrum, speaking even louder, \u201cI\u2019m asking you, you bumpkin!\u201dYou can also listen onLiked it?
