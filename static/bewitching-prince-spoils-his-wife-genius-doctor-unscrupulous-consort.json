When she was only 5 years old, it was concluded that she was a trash, her dantian completely ruined.But when she examined her body just now, her \u201cdestroyed\u201d dantian region at some unknown time, was actually completely healed.Although she didn\u2019t know why, it was definitely a great blessing for her.Only by getting stronger as soon as possible, could she change her current passive situation.Baili Huangzhuang believed that after what happened today, Baili Yuyan and Xuanyuan Huan wouldn\u2019t dare to bother her for some time.But just as Baili Huangzhuang was about to start cultivating, a tender voice suddenly sounded in her ear, \u201cThat Xuanyuan Huan is really too disgusting!\u201d\u201cI think that Baili Yuyan is even more shameless!\u201d The tender and high pitched cry was followed by a sharp voice.The 2 voices seemed to sound from nowhere as Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s eyes widened in suprise.

It made anyone who saw it revere from the bottom of their hearts.The sleek and glossy palace contrasted against Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s figure.

It gave off profound and mythical feelings, deserted like a small square.2 bold colors, black and white blended together to create an unspeakable sense of harmony. Both sides of the palace hall had two separate passages that led to the rear area.At that time, the familiar young and delicate voice rang out, \u201cMaster! Master!\u201dBaili Huangzhuang looked up in the direction of the sound, only to see two unidentifiable fluffy objects, one black, and the other white, rolling towards her.That\u2019s right! They rolled towards her!Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s eyes widened as she examined the two boys carefully, her expression suddenly turning brilliant.2 balls of fluff appeared in front of Baili Huangzhuang, one black and the other white. Their whole bodies were made of soft fur, making one think that it was a mere fur ornament or decoration at first glance.But if they were to look closer, they\u2019d be able to discover that it actually had 2 eyes and a nose. It was in fact, a living creature!Currently, 2 pairs of eyes, each huge like a grape\u2019s peered up at her, blinking curiously.\u201cMaster!\u201d The white ball cried while affectionately rubbing against Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s leg.The black fluff ball, not wanting to be outdone, immediately started rubbing against her other leg, calling, \u201cMaster!\u201dThe white fluff eyed the black one disapprovingly. \u201cIt\u2019s my master!\u201d\u201cMy master!\u201d The black one cried.Watching the two fluff balls argue, Baili Huangzhuang decided to interrupt. \u201cCan\u2019t one of you guys tell me what exactly this Primordial Chaos ring is and what it does?\u201d\u201cI can!\u201d The white fluff gave a little jump, saying, \u201cThe Primordial Chaos ring is an ancient artifact that appeared when the Shengxue continent was first created, and can make the owner unrivaled in the world!\u201d\u201cThen what happened with me passing through time then? Is it related to the Primordial Chaos Ring?\u201dThe black fluff jumped a little too, saying, \u201cBy the time the owner obtains the Primordial Chaos ring, the owner\u2019s blood has been remembered. However, after a long period of time, the ring may no longer remember the owner. When there are too many energy fluctuations, it may cause a rift through space and time, and only then may the owner pass through.\u201dAs the two fluffballs struggled to one up each other in their answers, Baili Huangzhuang gradually began to discover the roots of why she\u2019d passed through time and space.She did not expect to find, that this Primordial Chaos Ring was actually such a great benefit to her!Whoever becomes the master of the Primordial Chaos Ring can become peerless in this world. She had just so happened to find the Primordial Chaos Ring, and with the blood that accidentally fell on the ring, she had been recognized as the master of the Primordial Chaos Ring. By chance, a rift had randomly opened and she was transported through space and time to become the young miss of the General\u2019s household.She had heard legends of those powerful experts at the world\u2019s apex leaving behind their precious heritage or artifacts, but she\u2019d never expected that one day, an artifact would suddenly appear in front of her.Under the leadership of the black fluffball and white fluff ball, Baili Huangzhuang walked through the channel from the palace hall, into a stone room in the rear area.It\u2019s said that there was a very powerful cultivation technique here.The stone room was empty with nothing but a raised platform in the middle of the room, blooming with hazy black and white light.The two colored lights constantly mingled and entwined, emitting a mysterious aura that unwittingly attracted one\u2019s heart.Baili Huangzhaung slowly approached the raised platform. Brilliant rays of light flashed inside the hazy glow, surrounding a single merit law scripture. It\u2019s cover was black, the body thick and heavy. It emitted dense magical energy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDemonic Calling Scripture!\u201dIt was 3 simple words, commonly found everywhere. But here, they seemed to contain boundless power and strength, making people not dare to look at it!With just a glance, Baili Huangzhuang could easily tell that this was a treasure, a real treasure!With both hands, Baili Huangzhuang immediately seized the Demonic Calling Scripture. The second she took the Demonic Calling Scripture away from the stand, the radiant black and white rays that sparkled immediately faded away, no longer flashing vividly.Just by opening the Demonic Calling Scripture, Baili Huangzhuang could feel her head tingle violently.

The contents of the Demonic Calling Scripture had been firmly imprinted in her mind.She looked again at the Demon Calling Scripture in her hands. The cover had become completely white, and half of the text had vanished.Baili Huangzhuang then left the Primordial Chaos Ring. Unwilling to be left behind, the two black and white fluffballs ran after her.Ignoring the two fluffballs feelings, Baili Huangzhuang instructed them that they absolutely cannot leave the Elegant Daylily Pavilion until she finished her closed door cultivation.Baili Huangzhuang knew that if someone found out that she comprehended the Demon Calling Scripture, their faces would\u2019ve surely turned terrified. That is because, the Demon Calling Scripture is taboo merit law!It\u2019s cultivation speed is far from comparable to normal cultivation techniques, but only the master of the Primordial Chaos Ring could practice it.If other people were to try, there\u2019d be no possibility of succeeding. If they were to force it, they\u2019d only be digging their own grave.Cultivation techniques were divided into 4 grades. The worst was the Flow Merit Law, and the rest, in ascending order, is followed by the Star Merit Law, the Moon Merit Law, and the Sun Merit Law.And the most common technique grade majority of cultivators practice, is the Flow Merit Law.It\u2019s well known that, the highest cultivation grade technique is the Sun Merit Law.This Demonic Calling Scripture\u2019s grade was like a gambling chip, and was something Baili Huangzhuang had practically never heard of.Time flashed by. In the blink of an eye, a month had already passed.Baili Huangzhuang opened the door that hadn\u2019t been touched for many weeks. Golden fragments of sun shined on her body, warm and sunny.A graceful, sunny smile bloomed on Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s busy jade like face as she stretched her waist lazily. The results of going into closed door cultivation for a month really didn\u2019t disappoint her at all!As long as a somebody has stepped inside the Houtian Boundary, they are considered to be a cultivator.The Houtian Boundary divided into 3 realms, namely: Mysterious Earth Realm, Mysterious Eon Realm, and Mysterious Heaven Realm. Each realm is also divided into 3 states: early stage, intermediate stage, and late stage.A month of closed door cultivation and with the Demonic Calling Scripture\u2019s help, Baili Huangzhuang has succeeded in breaking through into the middle stage of the mysterious earth realm!Baili Yuyan had started cultivating from the early age of 5. Now at 16 years old, she is currently at the late stage of Mysterious Earth Realm, honored as a great talent.Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s cultivation speed, if this news were to be spread outside, it\u2019s unknown how many people would faint from shock!\u201cAfter staying inside for so long, it\u2019s time to take a walk!\u201dHer black like ink phoenix eyes flashed with helplessness and sorrow. Since the age of 5, she had never been outside the General\u2019s household, and had even forgotten what the imperial capital even looked like.Moreover, her cultivation also needs some stuff, so it\u2019s better to prepare now.Hearing Baili Huangzhaung\u2019s words, the twin fluffballs hastily jumped up and rushed towards her!\u201cMaster, I also want to go!Seeing 2 fluffy bodies zoom in her direction, Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s pupils widened as her body moved rapidly, managing to dodge the two furballs.Bang! Bang!The sound of 2 heavy thumps echoed across the room, 1 black and 1 white, two soft bodies cuddled together as 2 pairs of limpid, watery eyes looked at her tearfully.Baili Huangzhuang facepalmed. These two boys, besides their clinginess to her, they also have a certain kill technique\u2014\u2014 acting cute!In this month, she had deeply felt that these two boys were sent by heaven to become her nemesis!

With those two around, it seems like it\u2019ll be lively today.The Imperial City. The horde of citizens were nearly 10 Li long as they flocked the streets, both sides filled with stalls. They sold all kinds of stuff, voices reverberating throughout the street.Walking in the busy streets, Baili Huangzhuang couldn\u2019t help but almost imagine that of her life before she became the General Household\u2019s young miss.It\u2019s just that, the two constantly cheering boys on her head clearly reminded her that she was no longer the Baili Huangzhuang of 1000 years ago.\u201cSay, how about I give you two a name?\u201dBaili Huangzhuang\u2019s eyes twinkled with light.

So I made such a name, it was perfect!\u201dA breathtakingly beautiful smile bloomed on Baili Huangzhuang face.

If it\u2019s Prince Chen, then she also has some knowledge about him.If she was one of the biggest jokes the people liked to gossip about, then Prince Chen was the second joke.3 years ago, the present Emperor had suddenly made an unknown common man a Prince, giving raise to huge waves in the court. This man was Dibei Chen.Even though the court officers all protested, the Emperor still insisted on acting as willfully as before and made the man a Prince, even knowing that he was a cripple.For a long time, rumors everywhere speculated that Prince Dibei Chen must\u2019ve been the Emperor\u2019s illegitimate child. Otherwise, why would he confer the title of Prince to a incontempt cripple?But the Emperor, despite being aware of this rumor, chose not to step forward and explain, but on the contractionary, seemed to silently acknowledge it. So over time, everybody started to silently acknowledge Prince Chen as such too.Since the Emperor had made Prince Chen a prince so brazenly, it was believed that he must\u2019ve been heavily doted on by the Emperor. But although his first year was luxurious, the following years he got less and less as his status plummeted.Baili Huangzhuang slowly approached the noisy crowd. It could be due to them being fellow sufferers in her mind, or also because her heart held a trace of curiosity about this Prince Chen.After all, in this huge Imperial City, the tragedy in her life couldn\u2019t be compared to anyone else\u2019s, but Dibei Chen\u2019s.Walking amongst the crowd, Baili Huangzhuang looked at the target that held the circle\u2019s attention. On the 3rd floor of the Drunken Immortal Pavilion, stood two figures. With just a glance, Baili Huangzhuang could see a figure she absolutely loathed.Xuanyuan Huan!Xuanyuan Huan\u2019s face was bossy as he looked disdainfully at the pale, golden robed figure in front of him.\u201cDibei Chen, say, if I wasn\u2019t careful and accidentally knocked you down, pushing you off from the third floor of this building, then what would you do?\u201d Xuanyuan Huan\u2019s face held a sarcastic sneer, his sardonic attitude like he was treating Dibei Chen as a joke!Baili Huangzhuang looked at the back of the pale, golden robed figure. This must be Dibei Chen, no doubt.\u201cIf Prince wants to push, then what can I do?\u201dHis light voice was faintly warm from alcohol held a tinge of ridicule, like a refreshing cool breeze that stroked the heart, appearing free and indifferent.Xuanyuan Huan frowned when he saw his calm face. For a moment, he couldn\u2019t even tell who was doing the actual bullying.He was the most disgusted by Dibei Chen\u2019s indifferent appearance, as if nothing could ever affect him, ah.Acting like he was so high, when he was actually just a clown, he\u2019ll (XYH) let him see how much of a joke he(DC) really was!\u201cBig brother, how can trash act this way?\u201dThe second Prince, Xuanyuan Jing hadn\u2019t noticed the rising tension between Xuanyuan Huan and Dibei Chen yet, speaking with a smile, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just push him off already?\u201dXuanyuan Jing had just stopped speaking when he suddenly pretended to fall forward, his entire body stumbling towards Dibei Chen.

Too scared to move, he could only scream for help.\u201cHaha!\u201dIt was unknown who laughed first, but everybody couldn\u2019t help but laugh loudly.As the second prince hung from the railing, parts of his clothing had been torn, revealing his snow-white ass, arousing ridicule among the crowd.\u201cThe Second Prince\u2019s ass is so white, ah!\u201dAmongst the crowd, somebody spoke quietly, bringing around another bout of laughter.\u201cHaha, today we can see the ass of the royal family, its nothing different!\u201dEveryday, Xuanyuan Jing was always arrogant and despotic.

He no longer tried to cover himself, and could only scream at Xuanyuan Huan for help.Xuanyuan Huan\u2019s face was also very ugly. He originally wanted to insult Dibei Chen some more, but he\u2019d never thought that Xuanyuan Jing would actually be so foolish and lose him some face!

So over time, the herbal market changed into what it is now.Thinking about this, Baili Huangzhuang was very happy. Others may not know of the herbs uses, but she does, ah!This way, she could easily get precious herbs, and nobody would bother to stop her! This was simply like pie falling from the sky!\u201cPie is good, but you also need money ah.\u201d Baili Huangzhuang frowned.

As her total savings only amounted to 5 gold coins, she could be described as poor.\u201cThe poor can\u2019t afford it, ah!\u201dBaili Huangzhuang sighed, this matter was really urgent. Without money, she can\u2019t carry out her plans.When it comes to money, a handsome face emerged in Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s memory.

If the blister were to pop, then the pain would be gone, but a slow, tormenting poison would be released in its place.The symptoms would reveal itself in 7 days without any prior notice.

Once he realised that the imperial physicians couldn\u2019t do anything, he will definitely inform the outside world to call skilled doctors and physicians into the palace to treat his son.By that time, Baili Huangzhuang would sweep in and cure Xuanyuan Huan, giving her publicity free of charge!Then, everybody would know of her Godly Doctor Square, and business would naturally flow steadily from then on.\u201cWe\u2019re going to the palace now?\u201d Little Black and Little White were both puzzled before speaking up angrily, \u201cIn my opinion, it\u2019s not much better than just directly killing Xuanyuan Huan!\u201dXuanyuan Huan forced Master to suffer so much, this little pain is really not worth it!\u201cCompared to what he had done with the dead Baili Huangzhuang, this death is far too easy!\u201dA sharp light flashed through Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s eyes as the enchanting smile on her lips revealed a trace of ruthlessness.

She would first let Xuanyuan Huan taste all the pain the drug could possibly offer, before curing him of the poison.As he envisioned the moment when Xuanyuan Huan thanks Baili Huangzhuang gratefully, Little White laughed.\u201cThat\u2019s right. We also need to let everybody know just how severe this illness is before I cure it. Otherwise, how would I be able to show off my medicinal skill?\u201dThe next two days were just as Baili Huangzhuang had expected. Many doctors and physicians entered the palace with their heads held high, but left the palace sighing with heads tucked low.This strange illness was completely unheard of.Whether it was the miasma poisoning powder or itching powder, they were all Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s exclusive, hand-made recipes. Throughout the millennium, the recipes had gradually gotten lost in the flow of time. It was completely normal that nobody in Shengxue continent had any idea what it was.Furthermore, even 1000 years ago, there were only a small number that knew of these recipes.Because Baili Huangzhuang was always interested in drugs, poison, and powders back then, she had always spent her free time researching these various things. As such, many of these recipes were made by her own hands.When she had shown her results back then, all the elders noisily clamored as if they had seen a dog fly or a chicken bounce.Baili Yuyan had to be forcibly restrained due to the itching powder, her skin and flesh teared open. Nowadays, she hid in her estate, never visiting Xuanyuan Huan once even while he was ill.This matter aroused everybody\u2019s suspicions. After all, who didn\u2019t know Baili Yuyan and Xuanyuan Huan were a couple?Now as they saw such a situation, they couldn\u2019t help wondering in their hearts: Did something happen between the two?Although Baili Huangzhuang didn\u2019t know how bad Baili Yuyan\u2019s wounds were, she could easily guess that they weren\u2019t small.This itching powder was her own recipe, so how could she not know just how serious it could be?Baili Yuyan had poisoned her blind, so she\u2019ll destroy her looks! It\u2019s an eye for an eye.\u201cAnother day passes, more doctors enter the palace and walk out shaking their heads.

An arrogant air was suddenly present before her.The guards\u2019 original disdain cracked a little, stunned by Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s suddenly imposing attitude.As the palace guards, they had met many big shots and officials, however, they had never seen anyone with such a frightening demeanour.Not even His Royal Highness possessed such a lofty attitude. Under such an imposing aura, their primal instincts yearned to pledge their allegiance and serve her from the bottoms of their heart. But even so, they still didn\u2019t dare to defy their orders.The guards slowly recovered one after another as they stared, flabbergasted by this young girl, Baili Huangzhuang. Who is she!?How could her aura be so frightening!Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s face was still indifferent, a trace of haughtiness in between her brows. These guards were just dogs who lowered their heads to the strong. As long as you had the ability, they would be respectful to you.In her past life, she was the head of an extremely distinguished aristocratic family. Her lofty and imposing aura had been trained since young, and she may have passed through space, the imposing manner engraved in her still remained.Sure enough, as soon as she released her aura, the guards no longer dared to look down on Baili Huangzhuang. How could a normal person possibly have such an imposing, yet dignified aura?The Imperial Palace was a spectacular sight, gold and jade in glorious splendor. It released a blatant solemn and dignified air, making one deeply aware how small they were.Under the guard\u2019s leadership, Baili Huangzhuang finally arrived at the East Palace.The usually quiet East Palace was abnormally busy. Doctors, physicians, ministers, a group of 3322 people continuously worked to improve Xuanyuan Huan\u2019s condition.Upon seeing another doctor arrived, everybody just took a quick glance. For the past three days, a new doctor or physician would come almost every moment, and they were already long used to it.But when everybody saw Baili Huangzhuang, their faces all changed. It wasn\u2019t because of her looks, but because her age was just too small!A 15 year old girl that might not even be able to distinguish between the different herbs, but actually wants to treat the Crown Prince, is this a joke?!\u201cWhy\u2019d you bring this little girl here! Aren\u2019t you just causing trouble!?\u201d One of the many imperial physicians in the East Palace roared angrily.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough they were all working together to treat the Crown Prince, you can\u2019t just turn to any doctor one could find when critically ill and bring in this child!The body guard seemed to have already expected the physician\u2019s anger and had left as soon as brought Baili Huangzhuang to this room.Although the other doctors didn\u2019t say anything, their attitudes and thoughts were all the same. This little girl coming here is of no help what so ever, and is only a burden!\u201cElders, I still haven\u2019t even seen the Prince\u2019s condition, so are you already able to say that I can\u2019t cure your Prince?\u201dBaili Huangzhuang voice was unhurried, her clear, jade-like face indifferent and carefree.

Today, it can finally be considered as the start of his revenge.Baili Huangzhuang frowned a little, why does this guy insist on dragging her into their conversation?She\u2019s actually getting shot even while lying down, ah!Meanwhile, many of the pharmacists and doctors by the Crown Prince were all looking at Pang Tangping unhappily.This man was simply too arrogant!This situation in the East Palace was just because the Crown Prince\u2019s illness was never seen before, but with just a glance, he already started to look down on them all!Pang Tangping noticed Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s frown and instantly started to taunt her, \u201cLittle girl, what are you looking at?\u201dHearing Pang Tangping\u2019s disdainful and provocative words, Baili Huangzhuang\u2019s rosy face turned icy.\u201cI see a fat pig.

She was unflattering in the Emperor\u2019s eyes, so it was only reasonable to marry her off to Dibei Chen.\u201cSo then, are you really willing to marry Dibei Chen?\u201dOther people might not know, but Ji Wenbin knew clearly that Baili Hongzhaung and Dibei Chen were both very familiar with each other.Before, he had seen Dibei Chen sevral times in Godly Doctor Square.

He no longer continued to ask.Putting all the medicine into the Heaven and Earth bags, Baili Hongzhuang left for Heavenly Jewel Pavilion.Heavenly Jewel Pavilion was the largest shop in the Imperial City for all things cultivation.

Just the layout alone was enough to make a person\u2019s eyes light up.Even in the night, Heavenly Jewel Pavilion was as bright as day.All the pills, precious herbs, and weapons were displayed with a price tag, sorted out by rank and level, letting its visitors find the items they needed as soon as possible.The waiters and waitresses were all handsome men and beautiful women with gentle, polite smiles, naturally making one happy.Noticing Baili Hongzhaung, a waitress immediately came over and smiled, \u201cMiss, what might you\u2019ve come to buy here today?\u201d\u201cA pill furnace, do you have it?\u201dShe took a look around and had only seen pills, herbs, weapons, etc, but never once seen a pill furnace.Hearing Baili Hongzhaung wanted to buy a pill furnace, a touch of surprise appeared in the waitress\u2019s eyes before they returned to their usual calmness.Although Heavenly Jewel Pavilion did indeed sell pill furnaces, the people who bought them were very little.After all, pill masters were just too rare.

Du Hanyue was an apprentice pill master.Although her own concoction skills were insufficient, pill master Yun Qingfeng\u2019s skills were very well known.The hunting feast was right around the corner. She and Baili Haoxuan needed to show a good performance, so an appropriate pill was very important.Only after flattering Du Hanyue did she get him to promise to beg his master Yun Qingfeng to refine the siblings some pills.But this Du Hanyue was also ruthless, and even wanted them to buy him a pill furnace!This was an item expensive like no other, but under their current circumstances, the two siblings could only clench their teeth and bleed money!Seeing Baili Hongzhaung appear, Baili Yuyan\u2019s face turned disdainful.\u201cYou, you actually dare to enter Heavenly Jewel Pavilion?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou can enter, so why can\u2019t I enter?\u201dBaili Hongzhuang\u2019s words were sarcastic.

Just by opening Godly Doctor Square alone, her income was far higher than her own.Although she could eat and drink well in the General\u2019s Household and the monthly allowance of silver coins were many, the expenses were also large, so the real amount of money in her hands are actually rather little.Too lazy to bother with Baili Yuyan\u2019s nonsense, Baili Hongzhaung directly walked to the pill furnace shelves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Can you get it for me?\u201d Du Hanyue asked, pointing at the silver pill furnace.She fancied that pill furnace for a long time now, but it was always too expensive and the money in her hands was never enough.But since Baili Yuyan conveniently wanted to request something, she naturally wouldn\u2019t let the opportunity slip by.Seeing Du Hanyue choose the most expensive pill furnace, Baili Yuyan heart secretly turned gloomy, full of hatred and jealousy!She carefully looked at the price tag below it: 200,000 gold coins!

Although Heavenly Jewel Palace did indeed sell immortality pills, they\u2019ve long been snatched up, all in preparation for the royal hunting feast!If it wasn\u2019t for the Imperial City\u2019s pill masters being so rare, and the skilled pill masters being even rarer, then she wouldn\u2019t be doing everything here just to please Du Hanyue.\u201cI\u2019m only interested in this one, I don\u2019t want any others!\u201d Du Hanyue voice was slightly cold, \u201cYou can\u2019t even afford to buy me this, but still want to ask for my master\u2019s help.\u201dHearing this, Baili Yuyan turned anxious, \u201cLady Du, just wait a little.

Why did they leave me at the General Household\u2019s gates?\u201dBaili Hongzhaung frowned a little.

Before, I had just so happened to have accidentally seen a similar pendant in Feng Bo country.\u201d\u201cA family token?\u201d Baili Hongzhuang was a little surprised, \u201cFrom which family?\u201d\u201cThe Lan Family.\u201d Dibei Chen\u2019s words were blunt.As long as somebody was on at least his level, they would all know that this jade pendant belonged to the Lan Family. But the strange thing was, why is this jade pendant with Baili Hongzhuang?Since it was a family token, it was very precious.Furthermore, the jade pendant was something only directly-related descendants of the Lan Family could have. It\u2019d be extremely strange for it to have fallen into the hands of an outsider.\u201cThe Lan Family?\u201d Baili Hongzhuang raised her eyebrow, \u201cFeng Bo country doesn\u2019t have a Lan Family.\u201d\u201cI never said that the Lan Family was in Feng Bo country. Rather, it\u2019s an aristocratic family famous for being on the apex of cultivation- the Lan Family!\u201dBaili Hongzhuang\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. As the family head in her past life, she knew very clearly just how powerful of a background it was to be most prestigious aristocratic cultivation family on the continent.According to reason, a direct descendant of such a family usually wouldn\u2019t go to such a small, unknown country like Feng Bo. Moreover, her parents were being chased, making the possibility of them coming willingly, almost zero.Watching Baili Hongzhuang lower her head and think deeply, Dibei Chen\u2019s deep, ocean-like eyes flashed with intelligence.The fact that Baili Hongzhuang possessed the jade pendant alone was enough to prove her connection with the Lan Family. Otherwise, how could she even have the chance to hang it around her neck?\u201cWife, do you have a relationship with the Lan Family?\u201d Dibei Chen slowly asked, his handsome face unusually serious.Baili Hongzhuang lifted her head. The moonlight was dim, specks of light falling on Dibei Chen\u2019s elegant and perfect face, letting her clearly see his appearance.After a long while, Baili Hongzhuang spoke aloud. \u201cCan I trust you?\u201dDibei Chen\u2019s eyes changed as his lips formed a quiet smile. \u201cYou and I are husband and wife now. Of course you can trust me.\u201dSeeing how Dibei Chen was still speaking so flippantly, Baili Hongzhuang didn\u2019t bother to talk to him again, turning around to leave.Dibei Chen caught her hand and suddenly pulled, reversing their positions so she was under him. It was just like before, but this time, he was even closer to her.\u201cI was saying the truth.\u201d Dibei Chen stared at Baili Hongzhuang, his eyes gentle, \u201cYou have to believe, no matter what, I won\u2019t ever do anything to hurt you.\u201dThe words were spoken by Dibei Chen like an oath, firm and devoted.Baili Hongzhuang\u2019s eyes slowly changed. In that moment, she saw Dibei Chen\u2019s true dedication.The reason she asked this question was because although she and Dibei Chen\u2019s relationship was a bit messy, she still believed that he wouldn\u2019t harm her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSometimes, there doesn\u2019t need to be any reason to have a heart-to-heart. If two people believe each other to be able to get along, then it counts as having gotten along.\u201cWhatever you want to say or ask, you can just talk frankly.\u201d Dibei Chen smiled, \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone.\u201dA gentle smile blossomed on Baili Hongzhuang\u2019s face, \u201cActually, I\u2019m not a daughter of the Baili Family.\u201dHearing her words, Dibei Chen\u2019s eyes that were usually still and tranquil like a lake suddenly became turbulent, the waves similar to a stormy sea. This was a possibility he hadn\u2019t ever thought of before.Earlier, he had already sent some people to search Baili Hongzhuang\u2019s background, but still hadn\u2019t ever heard anything about this. He was very clear of his own abilities. If he still couldn\u2019t find out, then that\u2019s just how deeply guarded of a secret that was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you hadn\u2019t known about this jade pendant, I still never would\u2019ve known what it represented.\u201dA Lan Family daughter!That was the first thing Dibei Chen\u2019s mind came to. But after thinking about it, he knew that it was impossible.He was very clear what kind of a monster the Lan Family was. How could the powerful Lan Family let a child be dropped outside?\u201cHow did the General\u2019s Household wife take you?\u201d Dibei Chen asked again.Baili Hongzhuang explained, clearly telling him everything she knew from her mother\u2019s diary. She also wanted to know more about her own life.\u201cYour whole body was covered in blood?\u201dDibei Chen\u2019s handsome face frowned. The Lan Family has always been strong. Even in the entire Shengxue Continent, there were very few powers that could contend with them. It was impossible for a daughter of the Lan Family to be reduced to such a state.But if not so, how could a Lan Family jade token be on Baili Hongzhuang\u2019s body?Suddenly, Dibei Chen\u2019s eyes flashed, suddenly recalling something!\u201cWife, was it true that you couldn\u2019t cultivate?\u201dBaili Hongzhuang nodded slightly, \u201cYes.\u201d\u201cSo\u2026 \u2026 what was the reason why you couldn\u2019t cultivate?\u201dWhile everyone knew that Baili Hongzhuang had a trash physique and couldn\u2019t cultivate, nobody knew if she was trash because of her body\u2019s constitution, if the meridians were damaged, or some other problem or not.Baili Hongzhuang inspected Dibei Chen, sensing he knew something. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t suddenly be asking her this.\u201cMy dantian was broken.\u201d Baili Hongzhuang replied truthfully.When she had first found out, she had thought it was very strange. In this world, people usually became trash because there was a problem with their body\u2019s constitution or the meridians were blocked. A dantian could only be broken if the body was seriously injured.At that time, she was very young. It should\u2019ve been almost impossible for someone to deal such a ruthless hand to her.Finally hearing Baili Hongzhuang\u2019s reply, Dibei Chen\u2019s face suddenly changed, his normally calm face revealing shock.\u201cWhat does my broken dantian have to do with my history?\u201dThe light in Dibei Chen\u2019s eyes sunk, slowly saying, \u201cI remember many years ago, the Lan Family created a big stir. The most favored son of the Lan Family head had betrayed the family, killing many of the family\u2019s members before leaving with his wife and daughter.\u201dBaili Hongzhuang was startled. If such a thing really did happen in the Lan Family, then could it be that\u2026.\u201cIt impacted the Lan Family greatly. Lan Yunxiao was the most promising candidate to become family head, so nobody could understand why he would suddenly turn his back on the Lan Family. This was a secret the Lan Family had deliberately kept hidden from the world so many people only knew of the results, and not what actually had happened.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou mean I could be that Lan Yunxiao\u2019s daughter?\u201d Baili Hongzhuang asked aloud.Dibei Chen pondered. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. Your jade pendant is a Lan Family token, something that only direct descendants of the Lan Family possess. It\u2019s impossible for it to fall into the hands of outsiders.\u201d\u201cMy parents seemed like they were fleeing from something and was forced to leave me with the General\u2019s Household.\u201d Baili Hongzhuang frowned, \u201cWas it the Lan Family that killed my parents?\u201d~~~Dantian: A place 2 points below the navel where qi residesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
