Rarely breathing fresh air, Zhang Tie walked alone on the road to school. \u201cIt should be more azure without the black smoke rising from the towering chimneys into the sky,\u201d he thought while absent-mindedly striding over the black puddles on the cement ground. After it rained, the remaining water on the ground was black and smelt like the coal ash in the mill areas. While this city brought people a sense of safety, it also brought the feeling of being bound and the feeling of congestion. Looking into the distance, Zhang Tie found the huge chimneys to be pretty dazzling under the crystal blue sky.Teacher said that chimneys symbolized human civilization and guaranteed the prosperity and survival of human beings. Those upright chimneys, however, reminded Zhang Tie of his p*nis and the black smoke his seminal fluid. They polluted air like how the liquid polluted his underwear. Although he couldn\u2019t remember who was in his dream last night, for the third time this week, he could feel something sticky inside his underwear. In this age that severely lacked living necessities, Zhang Tie only had four pairs of underwear. Two pairs were tailored from his father\u2019s torn sweaters, while the other two were his brother\u2019s hand-me-downs. As it was always raining these days, two pairs of his underwear were still wet, including the current one. He only had the last half-dried one left; therefore, he had no other choice but to go to school miserably in this pair of underwear.The half-wet, coarse cloth turned hard and felt uncomfortable in the trousers. As a result, he always felt pain on his d*ck. It also felt very cold; Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but shiver. What was more was the 15-year old\u2019s d*ck got damaged. What torture!It was said that human society owned rich materials before the Catastrophe. In that age, underwear was sold by the dozen. Moreover, many precious articles like cigarettes, wine, meat, and as well as various rare and eccentric goods could be easily bought from a place called the supermarket. At that time, an ordinary man could afford 40-70kgs of rice or wheat through a day of labor, which was enough for him to live for half to one month, or perhaps even longer. It was also said that a mysterious energy called \u201celectricity\u201d was made; human beings could use it to do many unimaginable things. Additionally, people also invented many great weapons which made them the only ruler on the celestial body. They were so arrogant that they held everything else in contempt. Unfortunately, what waited for the heyday was the Catastrophe.Zhang Tie always thought that even the gods could not stand the unending greed of humans; therefore, it launched the Catastrophe and created the Star of God. As punishment, the gods beat human beings back from their peak into a simpler age. As a result, human beings lost all the magical powers brought by science and technology. They had neither electricity, nuclear power, explosives, nor those amazing weapons. According to the most accepted saying, there was some particle in the unknown rays carried by the Star of God that greatly changed all micro components of the substances on the celestial body. Take the original star as a pot of plain water. Once the almighty god or any celestial beings found human beings uncomfortable, they could spray a hand of salt or pepper powder onto it casually, and as a result, the plain water was no longer plain. Likewise, the star was not the very same either.After the catastrophe, what people felt was fortunate might be that steel and iron were still as hard as before; they could be used to cast into cutleries, swords, and armors for the army. Black coal was still combustible; they could still bring light, heat, and energy to human beings. In other words, everything made from the above two such as cutleries, swords, armor, thermal energy, and steam engines would be the last dependence of human beings in this age\u2026It was more than a 40 minutes\u2019 walk distance between home and school. Zhang Tie had to go through the slums in the western parts of Blackhot city and the barren region at the margin of the urban mill district before he arrived at school. The name of Blackhot City originated from the Blackhot Mountain next to the city. It was said that Blackhot Mountain was one of the longest mountain ranges on Kun\u2019ang Continent before the Catastrophe. Back then, people created an aircraft that could fly faster than sound; however, it still took the aircraft several months to fly across the range from one end to the other. Take Blackhot City for an instance. It was actually a fine branch south of the Blackhot Mountain Range. It stretched over 20,000km, a length that many people would not traverse in their whole lives.When the Catastrophe arrived, the Kun\u2019ang Continent, which covered hundreds of millions of square miles, was divided into pieces due to the tremendous geological and plate movements, akin to a loaf of bread being split by kids. Numerous parts formed, while the others directly disappeared. Through vicissitudes, people today could not imagine the magnificence of Blackhot Mountain and the grandeur of this vast continent. Even now, the world was still too large for everyone. The location 800km west and north of Blackhot City has yet to be explored; it was still an unknown. However, the area where Blackhot City was located, south of the Blackhot Mountain Range, covered more than 400 million square km. More than 9 billion lived here. It was a gathering of numerous countries, city-states, and clan forces; however, it was merely a slim and narrow belt on the map of the whole continent. With lofty mountains on the northernmost and westernmost regions and vast oceans on the southernmost and easternmost regions, it was the area with high population density. On the map, it was named the Blackson Human Race Corridor.After the Catastrophe, it took human beings about 100 years to find out what happened to the planet when the Catastrophe fell. It then took the remaining people almost 100 years to recover slightly. Unexpectedly, they found that human beings were no longer the only ruler of the planet. Those eccentric demons and dark clans from underground took human beings as delicious dim sum and slaves. They made the planet dangerous and posed several challenges to the survival of human beings.Today marked the 889th year on the Black Iron Calendar after the Catastrophe. Human survivors continued to multiply and now stood firm on the Kun\u2019ang Continent once again. Furthermore, driven by countless steel, iron, and steaming machines, they became ambitious to further explore the planet and convince the world that they were the rightful rulers once more.Blackhot City was younger than 40 years; it was the symbol of humankind\u2019s rejuvenation and re-ignition of ambition. It was young compared to the numerous human countries and city-states in the southern area of the Blackhot Mountain Range. Blackhot City was founded by businessmen and mill owners. As an industrial city, it occupied a seat in the Andaman City-State Alliance Parliament. Same as most emerging cities in this age, the city relied on rich resources, which included rich coal and mineral resources. The entire city and its 3 million inhabitants were depending on the rich resources from underground the city. It was ruled by the Coal, Steel, and Iron Federation of Blackhot City (CSIF). Numerous steam locomotives would carry coal, steel, iron, cutleries, swords, and armors, as well as other weapons and equipment, out of this city from factories. Meanwhile, they also transported in goods from outside the city.Under the most firm chimney was the mill where Zhang Tie\u2019s father worked. As an iron and steel mill, it almost always ran around the clock. Ever since Zhang Tie was born into this world, the chimney had been emitting black smoke. It witnessed the human\u2019s decision to rejuvenate.When Zhang Tie arrived at school, he found that Captain Kerlin, the military officer and educational director of the school, was standing upright like an iron tower at the school gate as he usually did. Ox-egg eyes gazing at each student entering the Seventh National School of Blackhot City seriously, he was patting an iron rod like a toothpick on his other hand, which produced a frightening sound. No student dared to look at his scary face that was covered by a black eye patch. They all passed as fast as they could, with their heads lowered.\u201cStop!\u201d A poor boy standing not far from Zhang Tie was stopped. The thunder-like voice caused everyone to shiver. When they found out that they were not the one, they quickly lowered their heads and passed the gate while silently praying for the boy.The poor boy turned pale. When he saw Captain Kerlin walking towards him, his legs shook heavily as he staggered, \u201cCaptain\u2026 Kerlin\u2026\u201dAs the most terrifying one-eyed man in the school, perhaps even in the whole Blackhot City, he preferred being called Captain Kerlin instead of Director Kerlin. It was a precious experience accumulated by numerous predecessors in this school at the cost of blood and tears. As Captain Kerlin could fight terrifying demons, any resistance or struggle in front of this terrifying man was in vain and would only make him more thrilled.Silently, Captain Kerlin simply pointed at the trousers of the boy with the iron stick in his hand.Perhaps due to the rain, there were some mud marks on the boy\u2019s trousers; that would be seen as guilty by Captain Kerlin.\u201cI\u2026 I will clean it right away!\u201dWith his wrist raised high, Captain Kerlin glanced at the shiny watch, slowly and expressionlessly. He held that pose silently for more than 10 seconds while he patted the iron stick, which produced a horrible sound,\u201dPah Pah\u201d.Zhang Tie doubted that this guy aimed to just show off his valuable watch. When he patted the iron stick, it reminded Zhang Tie of a timber wolf wagging its tail.\u201cYou know what will happen if I see you like this after school!\u201d\u201cI know\u2026I know\u2026\u201d the unlucky boy hurriedly rushed into school like having been remitted. When Zhang Tie was curious as to why Captain Kerlin was so kind today, unexpectedly, the one-eyed man looked at Zhang Tie\u2019s direction and rapidly arranged his mane-like hair. He stood upright, showing his well-developed pectoral muscles and made a magnificent pose. He raised his developed pectoral muscles and even shook them like a sexy lady. Besides that, a smile appeared on his ferocious face which almost frightened Zhang Tie.\u201cMiss Daina, good morning!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA fragrant wind blew past Zhang Tie, as a mature and beautiful lady passed by him. Needless to say, Zhang Tie knew who was coming; the dream last night became clear now. Zhang Tie became breathless when he saw that exaggerated, undulant curve of her waist and hip from behind. With her beautiful curly brown hair, Goddess Daina entered the school gate under the thirsty look of all the male animals. The proud goddess nodded to the one-eyed man who greeted her. He instantly became thrilled, and his face turned red. As a result, the iron stick in his hand was bent, reflecting his horrible face.Miss Daina was the very woman that all male students in the school desired to see in their dreams; they also fantasized about her when they masturbated. Her husband had died in the front lines soon after they got married. She was the goddess and the only scenery in the school. She was the flower on the cliff and the person whom Zhang Tie fell in love with secretly. She made the young beasts live an enthusiastic life.\u201cIn two more years, I can afford a house downtown!\u201d shouted the one-eyed man towards her back like a lion in heat \u2014 No, a disgusting and horny boar. Zhang Tie would even like to kill and replace him when he thought of the scene where Goddess Daina is groaning painfully under him\u2026\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d glancing at the rest of the people maliciously, the one-eyed man shouted. As a result, everybody, including Zhang Tie, lowered their heads and rolled through the school gates. Zhang Tie greedily sniffed the last fragrance in the air. That beautiful and mature figure always made Zhang Tie self-abated. He was not even brave enough to have a face-to-face look at her. If Goddess Daina was a noble and beautiful swan flying elegantly over the tranquil lake, then Zhang Tie felt that he would be a wild duckling that fell into a quagmire full of coal ash. Lowering his head, Zhang Tie gazed at the pair of old leather boots and became somewhat frustrated. What could a poor student like him give to Goddess Daina? Even Captain Kerlin was striving for her? **? How long would it take him to live downtown with high city walls like Captain Kerlin? Thirty or forty years? Thinking of this, Zhang Tie suddenly turned blue. However, the very thing inside his trousers, once again, became hard once he sniffed the fragrance of a mature female in the air\u2026On the stony wall before him, several words were carved into it \u2014 WELCOME TO THE AGE OF BLACK IRON.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_The Seventh National School in Blackhot City was a standard male school; there were literally no female students in the school. Courses for male students were completely different from those for female students. For the purpose of conserving resources and increasing teaching efficiency, boys and girls were separated into different schools after five years\u2019 compulsory preliminary education in the same school. All courses in the school for males were for survival. Each young man entering school should accumulate their survival assets in the fastest speed and at the least cost! Each graduate had no graduation certificate at all; the best certificate was surviving in this world. Thus, each course in the school was closely related to your survival. In the male school, besides learning basic Chinese, laws, and math, they also had to learn skills like taking care of seeds, making it mature, and turning grains into food. In contrast, education in the female school would be more human-friendly with courses like music, literature, cooking, fine arts, and dance.How to use all resources near you and turn them into basic survival tools.How to use convenient resources and build the simplest house.How to identify and avoid attacks from dangerous wild animals.How to make basic medicines with wild plants.How to deal with several common diseases.How to use weapons.How to increase your own physical strength\u2026After eight years\u2019 national compulsory education, 99% of common graduates would leave school and enter society. They had to start their own lives. If you had learned well at school, you could be a tenant with a hoe, a worker inside a factory, or a soldier in the army \u2014or the food of alien clans or cannon fodder, although you have a little training. The national education spirit in the Age of Black Iron was to cultivate survivors instead of wild animal wastes, in the most efficient means and at the least cost.Of course, same as before the Catastrophe, compulsory education in this age was not the greatest. After eight years\u2019 compulsory education, only a few elite students with a strong background or exceptional talents were qualified to learn more professional knowledge and receive true elite education in more senior and mysterious places. Naturally, Blackhot City didn\u2019t have any senior elite colleges at all since it was founded by a group of businessmen and mill owners. It only had an ordinary commercial school which was already much-in-demand for commoners.Only the human cities with deeper cultural deposits and core agglomerations owned true elite colleges; however, they had strict enrollment conditions that only one in ten thousand students could be enrolled. To put it simply, the Seventh National School in Blackhot City had one thousand graduates each year. Despite this, for eight consecutive years, it failed to cultivate a single graduate that was qualified to enter a true elite college. Eight years ago, a Chinese talent named Li Shizhen was selected by the Continental Alchemists Trade Union. He was directly taken away after graduation. The man became the pride of the entire school, and as a result, his personal photo was hung in the exhibition room of the school for eight years. In each general assembly, the headmaster would always talk about Li Shizhen\u2019s glorious past. The other two photos that were hung together with Li Shizhen\u2019s photo were both legendary graduates from the school. The high-end education in this age was definitely true elite education. By contrast, the enrollment size of ten million students a year in national high-end colleges before the Catastrophe was utterly a myth. Knowledge in this age was unexpectedly expensive and was only mastered by the minorities, a few clans, powerful schools, and all shrines and churches. Only the true elites could have the opportunity to touch that.Although Zhang Tie worked hard at school, he failed to become an elite or a lucky dog in this age where everyone was striving for survival. As none of Zhang Tie\u2019s family members or relatives were big figures, Zhang Tie was also common in every aspect. He was not the worst, good, elite, or crap. If it went on like this, Zhang Tie felt that he would have to follow in his father\u2019s steps. He might look for safe and stable work after serving the military. He would strive to be a common worker in a city mill and marry a diligent woman with a common look. He would have several kids and work hard like an ant for the food of the whole family until one day, he would lie in bed, almost dead, recalling his miserable and dark life like a tiny screw in this age and missing the beautiful ladies like Goddess Daina whom he had met, but never slept with. Then he would raise his quivering hand and raise his middle finger towards this motherf*cking age before kicking the bucket\u2026Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but shiver when this thought came to mind. He entered the classroom and swore to never live such a life. Although he had long made such a decision, he especially reminded himself to live long enough to have gold coins and sleep with enough beautiful women. If one day he had to pass away, Zhang Tie hoped for such a scene: a great number of beautiful and sexy ladies would weep for him, perhaps even die for him. Meanwhile, many disobedient children and grandchildren couldn\u2019t help but chuckle to themselves, or even LOL, that thankfully, the old man kicked the bucket.Zhang Tie imagined that he might also live those big figures\u2019 lives one day \u2014 dozens of pairs of underwear in the cabinet, dozens of pairs of new leather shoes, meat in each meal, and a personal maid with plump, sexy breasts and butts\u2026Zhang Tie always thought this way. He always thought that no big figures would worry about food and clothes. However, it was unreachable like an ugly duckling rolling in a quagmire yet dreamed of being a giant dragon.About ten minutes before the technical class, when Zhang Tie entered the classroom, he found several beasts peering out the windows with one hand rubbing fast. Some of them even slightly groaned. Zhang Tie looked out a window, and what impressed him was Goddess Daina\u2019s plump breasts as she passed by the flower terrace with her slim and supple figure\u2026Zhang Tie swallowed his saliva\u2026\u201cBastards!\u201d\u201cBighead, what\u2019s up! Come on! Let\u2019s enjoy it\u2026\u201d the acne-covered guy who was rubbing his d*ck out of his trousers turned around and suggested Zhang Tie 'sincerely\u201d.\u201cNo, I saw Captain Kerlin heading for our classroom. You keep enjoying it!\u201dHearing this, everyone stopped and turned pale. Their d*cks shrunk in a speed that could be identified by naked eyes, like deflating balloons. Then the classroom was in general turmoil. Several people\u2019s flesh, even the pubic hair, was caught by the zippers. Therefore, howls and wails spread throughout the classroom. God bless. Zhang Tie would bet that Captain Kerlin would definitely rush in and break their eggs if he knew what was happening in the classroom\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEveryone instantly returned and pretended to stand in front of their operating tables. All of a sudden, the classroom became quiet. Zhang Tie also went to his operating table and cleaned it casually. He then started to check whether the tools on it were well arranged. Ten minutes soon elapsed. When the bell rang and the teacher walked into the classroom with a large amount of things in hand, Captain Kerlin still hadn\u2019t shown himself. Relaxing, those bastards glared at Zhang Tie, although they dared not to be presumptuous in the classroom.The teacher was a 50-odd year bald man; he always looked gloomy and spoke as little as possible. However, no one dared to look down on him, as the old man once made a pile of waste into a small, single-cylinder streaming machine in a single morning by using several simple tools in front of them. The streaming machine started to rotate when a fire basket was put on it. Besides the old man, every teacher in this age was great.As usual, when the bald man entered the classroom, he wrote \u201cman-made spiral spring\u201d on the blackboard. He then began his lessons, and after that, he left formulas and relevant data on the spring winding ratio, compressive slenderness ratio, core diameter, and tensile strength and designated people to distribute his steel wires. Each student received three steel wires. Their work this morning was to casually manufacture three kinds of spiral springs. Receiving the steel wires, everybody started to work on their own operating table. Those bastards looked totally different from before since they were striving for their survival now. The bald man walked out of the classroom with a glass of water in hand.The largest difference between human beings and the powerful beasts and alien clans that only knew how to massacre was that human beings could create and use tools. Springs, although tiny, were applied in many areas. Undoubtedly, creating springs by hand became a survival skill.Getting his own steel wires, Zhang Tie thought for a while and got an idea. He kept the formulas in mind and measured his three steel wires in different lengths and thicknesses. Then, he started to calculate on a writing board. Finally, he had decided the shape of the three springs. Namely, a simple column compression spring, a concave type compression spring, and a column-type torsion spring with a round hook\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Each operating table was an iron desk that was longer than a meter. A rotary vice clamp was fixed on one end of each iron desk, and tools were placed in the tool slot at the front of the desk. The tools included: a hand saw, file, hammer, chisel, screw tap, incisor, straight steel ruler, divider calipers, scratch awl, and vernier calipers. On the other end of the table, there was a set of pedal-type grinder and an anvil that was placed beside the grinders.This was the most common and the cheapest operating table that was meant for apprentices. It was said that each senior operating tables was matched with a steam-powered module and a melting furnace. As for the experienced workers, a senior operating table was enough because they could make almost everything on it.With his plan in mind, Zhang Tie instantly put on his work uniform and put on his protective goggles. He then started with the largest steel wire. As he had no special steel wire control panel, he had to utilize the existing tools to process it. After fixing the steel wire and the wooden board onto the jaw vice, he placed the core well inside and fixed one head of the steel wire onto it. After rotating it in the clockwise manner carefully, he checked and found no problems, thus he continued to rotate it.Generally, it was not that hard. After a while, Zhang Tie had almost finished his first spring. He counted the number of spring circles and cut off the excess circles on the anvil. He then grinded the two burry ends of the steel wire with the grinder, and finally, the simplest column-type spring was made. He tested it and found it to be truly flexible. Zhang Tie\u2019s spirit rose as he finished the remaining two springs easily. It took him a bit more time to complete the round hook. By comparison, when Zhang Tie was working hard on a round hook with a chisel, someone else had already finished three springs.Finally, the bald man walked inside and answered the questions of the students who raised their hands. He checked each student\u2019s three works and explained tempering heat treatment on the springs. He emphasized that the ends of the springs should be round and tightened. He then solved problems regarding the coiling of springs and the creation of internal and external torque arm tools. The students then had another try. Three hours in the morning soon passed in this fashion\u2026The students ate lunch in the school cafeteria. This was also a benefit of the school, although the food was not that good. They often saw no oil for a couple of weeks, and the food could only sated their hunger, but was not enough to fill them. Even then, the crowd that rushed towards the cafeteria at lunch time was really horrible.According to the arrangements of the school, cafeterias were divided by grades, and even the number of diners was fixed. As the number of dining plates was always less than the number of students in each grade\u2019s cafeteria, there were always some people with bad luck that failed to get their lunch at each noon. As a result, they would directly pass out on the playground where they accepted military skills training in the afternoon. Zhang Tie himself had encountered this occasion twice. From then on, he deeply understood the first rule in the Age of Black Iron, namely striving to fill his stomach.The only rule in the school cafeteria was to line up; therefore, if you didn\u2019t want to be part of the starved group, you would have to line up as soon as possible. Besides that, you should also be strong enough in case of aggression from others. Certainly, luck was also very important.Take this time for instance.Zhang Tie was standing in the middle of the line. After three hours\u2019 classes, the group of fifteen or sixteen-year-old male students were starved. The line was already long, while many students continued to join in. Thankfully, Zhang Tie slipped away extremely fast after class. Otherwise, he might have had no food today. When the slowest students arrived at the end of the line gloomily, the students at the front had already gotten their lunch and were ready to eat it. Right then, the noisy school cafeteria suddenly became quiet. Zhang Tie looked back and found a group of people led by Glaze swaggering over. Although they arrived last, they didn\u2019t line up at all. Instead, they strutted directly to the front of the line. Seeing this group, the students who had just received the dining plates turned pale.F*ck, disgusting craps. They do this every noon! Zhang Tie verbally abused inwardly.\u201cHo ho, sorry to trouble you today!\u201d They swaggered in front of the students who were receiving lunch. Speaking kindly, they showed off an arrogant air with their heads raised and nose towards the sky. They crossed their arms while showing a smile of ridicule. They looked at the students, whose faces had already turned pale, like what a cat would do to a mouse.\u201cMother f*ckers! They\u2019re really arrogant!\u201d Zhang Tie abused in a low voice.\u201cYou can also be arrogant and grab others\u2019 food like them if you are able to beat them!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s said that Glaze has already passed the examination and is qualified to be a LV 2 soldier. Two surging points inside him have already been ignited. Seventh National Middle School has not seen such a great figure for many years!\u201dTL note: The more surging points ignited, the greater the soldier would be.\u201cHe was just born strong; he has nothing to be proud of. They are just simple-minded guys with well-developed limbs. Are they attracting the school party in this naive method just to gain a recommendation?\u201d\u201cHumph\u2026 humph\u2026 no more jealousy. He\u2019s born with that exceptional aptitude, and they are much stronger than us, so we should stay away from them\u2026\u201d\u201cHe has a great dad, a big figure in the CSIF!\u201d\u201cBig figure? Pah! He\u2019s just a head guard !\u201d\u201cNaturally, those behind him are also big figures!\u201d\u201cI will never concede to that motherf*cker! No matter the reason!\u201d\u201cThey will beat you when you walk out the school gate, and it will take you one month to get up. Isn\u2019t that enough of a reason?\u201dWhen the people beside Zhang Tie discussed in a low voice, the boys being grabbed walked over dejectedly. When seeing the unlucky fellows, some showed looks of sympathy, while others looked cold. However, nobody dared to comfort them, not even with a single word. Each student at the school had to strive for themselves. This was why the cafeteria was several dining plates short everyday. If you didn\u2019t fight for yourself, nobody would fight for you. As for the weak people, they had no options. They either had to surrender to humiliation or suffer from nosebleeds and broken bones.The gloomy and embarrassed passersby reminded Zhang Tie of something. What would I do if it were me? What if they grab away my beloved Goddess Daina instead of just a dining plate? What would I do? Zhang Tie suddenly became worried. It seemed that he had already seen the desperate and weeping face of Goddess Daina. The teenager felt painful inside.Never\u2026The youth growled inside like a beast.\u2026The second floor of the cafeteria was for teachers. There were also several pairs of eyes peering over from behind the glass wall.\u201cLV 2 soldier. He was so powerful in front of those kids. Glaze himself could easily beat a dozen of them easily. He has such a physical advantage!\u201d\u201cThe group led by Glaze was composed of four people. By comparison, there were several hundred people behind them. They simply understood half of patient teachers\u2019 lessons and had learned how to compete and fight for their own lives, but they ignored the other half \u2014 teamwork, which was extremely critical to their survival\u2026\u201d\u201cThis is the difference between human beings and beasts. No matter how weak they are, weak individuals can be powerful enough to take down a strong beast once they have united.\u201d\u201cThey might understand this in the future, but not now\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI will see who among them can realize it first!\u201dThe voices behind the glass wall gradually became unclear amidst the sounds of friction from the forks and knifes and the crunching of food.Although Zhang Tie had no appetite, he still ate his poor lunch. He then queued up and seriously washed his dining plates and dinnerwares under a water faucet. After giving them back to the cafeteria, he felt somewhat frustrated, as the desperate and weeping face of Daina constantly appeared in his mind as if it truly had happened. He walked away with his head lowered; he became more depressed whenever he occasionally noticed the pair of heavily worn leather shoes with two patches on it. When he walked into the woods close to the school, he found himself surrounded by several people.\u201cAre you still satisfied with what you did to us this morning?\u201d A fist had already landed on his stomach before he had realized. Zhang Tie almost vomited his lunch. Bending over painfully, Zhang Tie finally realized what was happening. \u201cF*ck! I\u2019m surrounded by them. I already noticed their hostility in class, I shouldn\u2019t have forgotten that.\u201d\u201cBeat him!\u201d the moment he bent over Zhang Tie heard this voice, he found a pair of feet in front of him. Without thinking, he instantly tried his best to hug the pair of feet, and surprisingly, he knocked him over. Zhang Tie then quickly threw himself onto the opponent and punched the boy\u2019s nose before that he had realized what was happening. As a result, the guy fell flat on his back\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Right then, he felt a great force hit him from behind, and Zhang Tie was kicked away from the boy under him by another foot.In response to the force, Zhang Tie rolled forward along the direction of the force and instantly stood up by using \u201cCarp Jump\u201d. Carp Jump was a martial arts skill where a man would use the force generated by his legs, waist, and stomach to stand up when he is lying on the ground. The moment he stood up, he noticed two people pouncing towards him from both sides simultaneously. Zhang Tie kicked the person on the right; however, the boy was agile and instantly leaned his body while raising his leg at the same time to block Zhang Tie\u2019s kick. Feeling the pain, the boy grimaced and grabbed Zhang Tie\u2019s right hand by using both hands. Zhang Tie threw a punch at the boy with his left hand, but another pair of hands seized Zhang Tie\u2019s left hand the moment he sent it out. The moment he wanted to struggle, a heavy kick landed on his stomach, and Zhang Tie instantly lost his will to fight.The whole fight ended within thirty seconds. It was predictable; Zhang Tie fought six adversaries alone without any preparation while his opponents attacked him after delicate planning. Compared to the other six people, the yellow-skinned and black-haired Zhang Tie was evidently weaker. He was 175cm in height and 15 years of age. By contrast, among the attackers, even the shortest among them was as tall as Zhang Tie, while the tallest one was taller than 180cm and was 1.5 times as heavy as Zhang Tie. This was the difference between races.Bending over, Zhang Tie continued to vomit as his two arms were held up by his attackers. The attackers groaned and rubbed the areas where Zhang Tie had previously hit them before they surrounded Zhang Tie. The boy who Zhang Tie hit ferociously also stood up. All of a sudden, the boy felt something salty and wet in his mouth, and when he touched it, he noticed that he was bleeding from his nose which caused his hand to be dyed with blood. Being irritated, he strode forward and punched Zhang Tie in the nose as revenge for what Zhang Tie did to him. As a result, Zhang Tie was dazed as his nose ached. He felt a salty liquid instantly cover the inside of his throat from his nasal cavity. Zhang Tie instantly coughed. \u201cMotherf*cker,\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inwardly, \u201cwhat a quick revenge!\u201dSoon after, the rest of the group began to punch and kick him ferociously. Zhang Tie suffered from more than 10 punches and kicks. Had he not been supported, he would have long fallen to the ground. Zhang Tie kept gasping for air; he felt like a suffocating fish that had been thrown into the sand. He didn\u2019t even have enough strength to move his fingers.A boy intended to give Zhang Tie another punch, but his hand was held back by another person.\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Doug. His nose will be fully broken with another punch. It will be trouble if he\u2019s disfigured!\u201d\u201cYeah, we made a deal. No more punches and don\u2019t kill him. Motherf*cker, the zipper tore off my hair this morning. It\u2019s still aching now\u2026\u201d explained the guy who held Zhang Tie\u2019s right hand.\u201cBighead has average performance during the usual paired exercises. Unexpectedly, the two of us alone might not have been enough to control him today!\u201d said Barley, the most goddamned horny fatty in the class and the one who had suggested Zhang Tie to enjoy the view this morning. The acne covered boy was the founder and organizer of the jerk-off campaign and was one of the most infamous scums in his grade at Seventh National Male Middle School. He had stolen his father\u2019s money and sought for a prostitute to end his virgin status. He always treated this as glory and showed off constantly in front of others.Doug hurriedly rolled paper into slim columns and inserted them into his nostrils to stop the bleeding. Raising his head, he pointed at his nose madly and showed the wounds to the others. \u201cF*ck, you\u2019re not as wounded as me. How do I have such damn bad luck\u2026\u201dHe gave another punch to Zhang Tie\u2019s stomach in anger. As a result, Zhang Tie completely poured out his lunch like a fountain; a great amount of wet and steaming vomit sprayed onto Doug\u2019s head. The others were stunned. Looking at Doug, who had paper columns still inside his nostrils, being sprayed by Zhang Tie\u2019s vomit caused everyone\u2019s face to twitch. Everyone tried to control the compulsion to laugh out. The two helpers beside Doug also moved back two steps with their hands pinching their noses. Similarly, the two men who were clasping Zhang Tie\u2019s arms also let him go instantly. They were really afraid of being sprayed on by Zhang Tie when he turned his head around.\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d screamed Doug weirdly before he rushed away in an unprecedented speed.Seeing Doug run away, the five other guys began to laugh out loudly. Zhang Tie recovered his composure after vomiting; he gasped for air and struggled to stand up. Noticing this, the two guys closest to him became alert and moved one step back. They were afraid of being sprayed on by Zhang Tie, who, at that point, could not even walk.Zhang Tie stood to attention quiveringly and gazed at the bear-sized figure behind the group. He squeezed out a smile as he said, \u201cCaptain Kerlin\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, you plan to attack us when we turn around? Bighead, do you think we\u2019re idiots? You read too many crap novels about knights!\u201d\u201cDo you want another beating!?\u201d\u201cToo young, too naive! We have not used that trick for many years\u2026\u201d the pudgy Barley grinned shamelessly as he shrugged his shoulders with jumping fat.\u201cReally?\u201d a horrible voice was heard behind them. All of a sudden, the five pleasant individuals were like frozen Mandarin ducks. Being rigid all over, their faces turned pale, and they kept sweating, as their legs begun to shake. Zhang Tie was really amazed at the series of difficult performances and movements in such a short period of time. Hearing Captain Kerlin\u2019s voice, Zhang Tie looked calm, yet his brain spun rapidly\u2026With his arms crossed, the most terrifying one-eyed man in Blackhot City wandered out from the woods behind them. Although he only had one eye, the way he gazed at people was like how a timber wolf would when they stared at chicks.\u201cCa\u2026 Ca\u2026 Captain Kerlin!\u201d the five people staggered in unison.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d raising his head, Captain Kerlin asked with his nose facing the sky.\u201cWe are\u2026 are\u2026\u201d staggered Barley, who was stopped by Captain Kerlin with a crude look.\u201cShut up, it\u2019s not your turn to speak!\u201d Captain Kerlin stared at them with wide eyes and pointed at the miserable Zhang Tie with a finger as strong as a wooden club. \u201cYou! Tell me what happened!\u201dHearing Captain Kerlin ask Zhang Tie, the group of five instantly turned blue. They were scared to death. With eyes opened widely, they stared at Zhang Tie full of fear,sadness and despair. If Zhang Tie told the truth, Barley dared to bet with his ass that when the captain knew that his beloved goddess was dirtied by some students this way, he would definitely make them impotent for the rest of their lives. Because of the special education system and courses, Blackhot City allowed a couple of injuries or deaths each year in each national middle school with no one who would claim responsibility for them.\u201cYes sir, Captain Kerlin. We were betting\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie made a decision inside. He considered fights between boys in the male middle school to be normal. In the recent years, he had fought with others many times. Although he suffered a little bit this time, it was still fine. After all, his father always taught him to forgive other people, and once he did, he would insist that they need to compensate him for what they did.\u201cBetting\u2026?\u201d Captain Kerlin frowned slightly and looked at the innocent Zhang Tie. He then turned and stared at the rest of the five, \u201cHe said you were betting, is that true?\u201dBetting? Of course, the five nodded like chicks who had been starved for three days.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow were you betting? What was the wager? You want to lie in front of your smart Captain?\u201d Captain Kerlin gazed at Zhang Tie.\u201cWe made a bet that if they failed to beat me together, then I can beat them back and take all the money in their pockets! I\u2019ve won the bet, so I invite Captain Kerlin to be the witness and do the righteous thing for me\u2026\u201d Barley and the rest gazed at Zhang Tie and finally became relaxed. Some of them started to curse inwardly, \u201cHe\u2019s still scheming for our money at this critical moment!\u201dZhang Tie strode forward towards them while cleaning his nose. He then punched and kicked each one of them on the nose and stomach respectively in front of Captain Kerlin. In an instant, the noses of the five continued to bleed with their heads lowered to the ground. They groaned painfully, yet no one dared to fight back.When the five stood up, Zhang Tie stretched out his hands in front of them and twiddled his thumbs with his index finger. Everyone knew the meaning of this\u2026Getting paid for beating others, what a wonderful life!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The least contributed was five copper coins while the most contributed was ten copper coins. Zhang Tie put the coins into his pocket without any hesitation. When it was Barley\u2019s turn, the damned fatty took out nine copper coins from his upper pocket and said while shaking and presenting an embarrassed but flattering smile, \u201cYou win\u2026\u201dLooking at Barley furiously, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t say anything. He didn\u2019t move back his hand at all. \u201cAre you sure that was all of your money? You know what the wager was. All of it, all of it\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie stressed the three words. They had been classmates for several years. Zhang Tie naturally knew how much the damned fatty had since he was always the richest among them and always took groups of people to restaurants.Barley and Zhang Tie glared at each other for a few seconds as their nose continued to bleed. Barley noticed Zhang Tie becoming increasingly confident with his raised shoulders. When Zhang Tie pretended to open his mouth to release the news, Barley\u2019s fat face finally twisted as his acne filled face turned blue. \u201cHo\u2026 ho\u2026 I almost forgot that I had some more\u2026\u201d saying this, with his eyes closed, Barley took out four shiny silver coins from his left pocket and placed them in Zhang Tie\u2019s hands.Seeing the four silver coins, Zhang Tie also opened his mouth slightly. \u201cI\u2019m rich now! One silver coins is equivalent to one hundred copper coins. He might have stolen his father\u2019s money again\u2026\u201dThis was a \u201chuge amount of money\u201d for Zhang Tie; however, Captain Kerlin didn\u2019t even glance at the silver coins. With arms crossed, he kept an eye on how Zhang Tie slapped the poor guys as one of his hands continue to stroke his short mustache, which was as hard as steel needles. Zhang Tie felt a little weak under the stare of Captain Kerlin.\u201cErm, interesting. Boy, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cZhang Tie!\u201d\u201cYou were good at being beaten. You dared to bet with them in this way. Well, I\u2019ll remember you!\u201d saying this, Captain Kerlin left right away.\u201cBighead, we\u2019re even\u2026\u201d raising his head, Barley sat on the ground so as to reduce the nose bleed. \u201cWe beat you and you also beat us. You got our money, but you saved us. To be honest, we have to thank you!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie also hurriedly took out some toilet paper from one of the trouser pockets. He rubbed the toilet paper into two columns and tucked them into his nostrils to stop the nosebleed. \u201cAfter all, we\u2019re students. It\u2019s ok to fight. I also didn\u2019t want to see anything happen to you, just like how you didn\u2019t want to see anything happen to me!\u201dWith the paper in his nose, he spoke in a low and muffled voice. It felt somewhat uncomfortable.\u201cDo you have more paper?\u201d Barley stretched out a fat hand.Zhang Tie pulled out all of his toilet paper and divided it with them. The others instantly imitated Zhang Tie\u2019s actions to stop their nosebleed. After a while, the six boys looked at each other and felt that it was very funny. A Chinese proverb came to everyone\u2019s mind at this moment, \u201cWith scallions into the nostrils, pretend to be an elephant.\u201d Motherf*cker, it was really ironic. Everyone wanted to laugh, but they didn\u2019t.After murmuring with the others with their heads lowered, Barley solemnly said to Zhang Tie something that Zhang Tie would never have thought of before.\u201cAfter what happened today, we felt that you\u2019re good enough. Therefore, we have solemnly decided to invite you into our organization. We hope you consider it\u2026\u201d\u201cYour organization?\u201d Zhang Tie glared at them in a doubtful manner. These craps shouldn\u2019t establish an organization. They were just a ragtag group.Noticing Zhang Tie\u2019s doubt, the crew pretended to be magnificent. Although their depressive expressions were not persuasive at all, Zhang Tie could still feel their enthusiasm.\u201cOut of blows, friendship grows. We have a good opinion of you; therefore, we have decided to invite you after discussion. Don\u2019t look down on us. Saplings today might grow to be towering trees in the future. Nobody is born to be a big figure. Once we have united, we will win a place in Blackhot City sooner or later!\u201dThe words moved Zhang Tie. Unimaginable. These guys should not be this ambitious. Compared with them, he would be the most timid one. Barley noticed that Zhang Tie was somewhat moved, so he continued, \u201cWe will graduate this year. After graduation, we basically have to serve in the army for eight years. We may encounter dangers and frustrations. It is really hard for one man to survive in this age, but brothers can always help you with whatever you meet in the future. There will always be a solution. With the help of brothers, we will not be easily bullied even in the troops!\u201dThe last words finally moved Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie began to be interested in their organization. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the organization?\u201d\u201cHit-Plane Brotherhood!\u201d said Barley proudly.Hit-Plane Brotherhood? Zhang Tie suddenly felt a chill when he thought of the scene from this morning where the group stood and masturbated in front of the windows. It was said that people had already invented an aircraft called the plane that could fly in the sky. Only god knew how and when \u201cmasturbation\u201d became associated with planes for the numerous adolescents. Zhang Tie could never think through how the dull and boring manual single-cylinder piston movement was related to that aircraft. He felt that the most holy place in his heart was stained when the scene of the damned fatty Barley masturbating in front of the windows that faced Miss Daina came to mind.\u201cI\u2019m willing to join, but you have to promise me one condition!\u201d Zhang Tie told Barley after several seconds.\u201cWhat condition!?\u201d\u201cNobody is allowed to treat Miss Daina that way in school from now on!\u201d the 15 year old young man felt great when he said this. Zhang Tie was a bit thrilled. No matter what, although he was weak, he could still protect Miss Daina in his own way.\u201cNo problem, that\u2019s a deal. From today onwards, you are one of us!\u201d the fat Barley responded frankly. It was not the first time for them to do this to Miss Daina. Even so, many animals in the school were doing the same thing every day; however, after today\u2019s event, the crew also realized what they did this morning was too risky. It was truly over for them if they were seen by Captain Kerlin. It was not an excessive condition while at school. No matter what, no one would stop them if they did that at home.Zhang Tie joined the Hit-Plane Brotherhood in this fashion. The crew\u2019s spirit rose with their new member. They seemed to have forgotten what had happened just now. Zhang Tie also didn\u2019t intend to give them their money back. He had made this decision, and if this damned fatty Barley asked for him to pay back in the name of the brotherhood, then he would instantly leave this motherf*cking brotherhood. Zhang Tie also understood the other members, which included Barley, Doug, Sharwin, Bagdad, Leit, and Hista. He was familiar with them as they were all classmates. The only contemporary rule in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood was being confidential about all situations regarding the brotherhood. They had no boss, and all decisions were determined through discussions.What amazed Zhang Tie was that the brotherhood was divided into different ranks ever since it was founded several months ago. Everybody agreed with the rules and considered it to be very fair. Barley naturally enjoyed the highest rank. According to Hista\u2019s explanation, Barley might be the largest contributor to the brotherhood; therefore, only Barley was qualified to be a Lv 2 member which meant Barley himself could vote twice each time. Consequently, a Lv 3 member could vote three times. As for Zhang Tie, since he was a new member, with the exception of Barley, he was only qualified to vote once like the others.When walking out of the woods, the fat Barley looked at Zhang Tie and hesitantly said, \u201cThat\u2026 the money\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s mine!\u201d Covering his pockets, Zhang Tie looked at Barley in an alert manner.The damned fatty scratched his head embarrassingly with a bitter smile, \u201cIt\u2019s fine. Let doug wait for another couple of days\u2026\u201dWhen the others heard what Barley said, they showed an obscene smile.\u201cDoug was really unfortunate today, hahaha\u2026\u201d squinting his eyes, Sharwin laughed. \u201cWhat bad luck!\u201d\u201cHe had waited two weeks for today!\u201d Hista shrugged his shoulders.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet him wait a few more days\u2026\u201d\u201cThen his face will be full of acnes!\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dZhang Tie couldn\u2019t understand what they were talking about at all. However, he felt the way they talked was somewhat obscene.\u201cHey\u2026 hey\u2026 you will know about it later. This is benefit for members!\u201d Barley said secretly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Zhang Tie had no idea how he was going to stand the hunger until school was over. He completely poured out his lunch earlier when he was beaten by the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood at noon, hence he had no choice but to stand the starvation. When he could no longer stand the hunger, he would drink water like a fish at a water faucet at school between classes. This was also a survival skill that he learned at school in this age. Drinking clean water like a fish could alleviate starvation and slow down the deterioration of physical strength. A person without food and water could survive two days at most, yet a starved person with only water could survive for more than three days. This showed the importance of water.What made Zhang Tie feel fortunate was that the class this afternoon was collective military drill, the class that consumed the least energy. In the training grounds for the entire afternoon, each undergraduate would wear infantry uniform and light armor and would carry a spear that was longer than three meters on their shoulders for training. They would perform formations and bayonet charges under the orders of the instructor. To be a level 1 pikeman and attain an emblem of a Level 1 pikeman symbolized the beginning of manhood and was the dream of most students when they served the army. Pikemen were the ones in the army that focused on formations and collective cooperation. They can be both the strongest arm and the weakest. A pikeman square matrix solely composed of first-ranked pikemen could easily defend against the attacks from enemies who were not in formation and had three times their number.Similarly, a heavy-armored square matrix composed of fifth-ranked pikemen was an important force on the main battlefield. With the citizens of Blackhot City and the millions of inhabitants that surrounded it, only three fifth-ranked heavy-armored square matrixes could be formed. This was the ultimate force used by the Coal, Steel, and Iron Federation (CSIF) to rule the city.Zhang Tie\u2019s physique was not greater than others; he looked thinner and weaker compared to the rest of the group. He didn\u2019t really like this profession. Zhang Tie had difficulties when he brandished and pierced with the three-meter long pike, which was heavier than 10kg. In the later stages, whenever he saw his powerless pike, Zhang Tie would always doubt whether he would be able to strike and kill the enemy with such low speed and force. Speaking of the pike, even the damned fatty Barley looked better than him. Zhang Tie gradually felt weak after fifty attacks; however, the damned fatty didn\u2019t weaken until more than seventy moves. Clearly, Zhang Tie was the weakest one in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood.Although he didn\u2019t like this profession, Zhang Tie had to admit that even though he disliked it, the square matrix composed of pikemen brought him a great sense of safety. Whenever he stood in the middle of the square matrix conspicuously and looked at his classmates around him, he would always feel a sense of safety. This feeling was very contradictory. It seemed that this was the reason why a small figure like Zhang Tie felt depressed in such an age \u2014 on many occasions, you had to depend on those you disliked.When the afternoon training ended, Zhang Tie felt like his whole stomach and belly was like a sac full of water. Whenever he moved, the water inside would always make a sound which made him uncomfortable. Whenever he attacked, each time he made a slightly fierce, big movement, Zhang Tie would always feel the water inside his stomach dash to his throat like a rising tide with a weird taste. The moment it made his throat uncomfortable, it would fall back. His hands were always powerless. For several instances, Zhang Tie felt the instructor\u2019s sharp stare on him and felt reluctant to leave. Zhang Tie had no other choice but to grit his teeth.The coach especially paid attention to Glaze. The square matrix with Glaze was the most spectacular among the six square matrixes on the training field. Glaze, a LV 2 soldier, instantly displayed the difference between him and the other green birds. He was as tall as 190cm and wielded a standard military pike that weighed more than 30kgs and had a red-headed flag attached to it. Glaze stood out and commanded the whole square matrix. Under the appreciative eyes of the coach, Grace became very thrilled. He would always wail like a ghost and howl like a wolf for each movement. As a result, the whole training ground was filled with his howls.Although Zhang Tie despised him to some degree, he would never deny that he would be killed by Glaze within a couple of movements or perhaps in a single move. Glaze truly had the right to be proud. With the exception of Glaze, the rest of the students in the graduating class were just reserve soldiers, not even first-ranked soldiers. Normally, most people would be promoted to first-ranked soldier before the age of 18, namely two years before providing military service. During the eight years of military service, more than 95% of the commoners would retire at the third or the fourth rank, while a few of them would reach the fifth rank. Only professional soldiers and people who survived on the force might reach the sixth rank. Soldiers who were promoted to be fighters could gain respect wherever they were.The moment training ended, Zhang Tie removed his smelly uniform in the locker room, hurriedly wore his shoes, and rushed out with his hands on his stomach without greeting the other members of the brotherhood, who were led by Barley. This made the members of the brotherhood embarrassed, as they were preparing to greet Zhang Tie. As a result, they kept staring at each other with a vacant look.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d the freckled and brown haired Sharwin scratched his head.\u201cI saw him drink a lot in the afternoon. He might not be able to stand it!\u201d replied Bagdad. As a black man, he was the strongest in the brotherhood. The training this afternoon was very easy for him. Naturally, he was the one with the highest fighting power in the brotherhood.\u201cHoho, poor guy!\u201d smiled Leit.\u201cI am the poor one!\u201d Doug, even now, was still resentful especially when he recalled that he was sprayed with Zhang Tie\u2019s vomit at noon. Doug always felt that he was the laughingstock throughout the afternoon.\u201cEasy, man. Barley will fetch those silver coins for you!\u201d Hista winked and made a obscene posture that everyone understood. Staring at Barley, he instantly became generous, \u201cWe brotherhood members have to eliminate the status as virgin and become true men!\u201d\u201cTrust me, you will have your benefit!\u201d Barley comforted the sad Doug as he patted him. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s shadow, Barley\u2019s fat face shivered painfully when the four silver coins came to mind. He shook his head. \u201cWhat an interesting guy! Although I have not seen what he\u2019s capable of, I find him to be smart and not bad. He\u2019s a reliable guy! At least I don\u2019t have to worry about being screwed over!\u201d rubbing his chin, fat Barley said in an experienced way.With the exception of Doug, who was still sulking, the rest of the group nodded.Zhang Tie rushed to the washroom and had a long piss. He finally became comfortable. Meanwhile, his belly also thundered. Walking out of the washroom stall, he simply washed his hands and dashed out the school gate. With four silver coins and thirty to forty copper coins in his pockets, he had to find something to eat, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t even have enough strength to return home.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was a bakery a short distance from the school gate. Usually, Zhang Tie could only swallow his saliva whenever he saw the delicious bread. Touching his pocket, today, Zhang Tie was finally brave enough to enter this bakery. He spent 10 copper coins to buy a loaf of brown bread. As he devoured the loaf of brown bread like a wolf and exited the bakery, Zhang Tie instantly noticed Miss Daina.Miss Daina was always eye-catching. Captain Kerlin and another male teacher were talking about her diligently and gently. Zhang Tie\u2019s face even transformed with the bread still inside. Zhang Tie was suddenly stunned when he saw Miss Daina. Captain Kerlin didn\u2019t even glance at him, probably because he felt it was too shameful to be familiar with him. However, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t realize until they were far away. He instantly turned back and looked at himself in front of the beautiful glass showcase. With the half loaf of bread that he almost choked to death on in his hand, his mouth was opened while his head inclined. Because he continually trained in the afternoon and hadn\u2019t stopped his nose bleed yet, two paper balls were stuck inside his nostrils. His eyes were squinted like a crack, and his face showed that he had been beaten by others. He just stood there like an idiot with bread crumbs and saliva hanging at the corners of his mouth. He was clearly slow-witted.Miss Daina should have seen him just now? Zhang Tie became endlessly frustrated and gloomy. No wonder she didn\u2019t even glance at him. He really was slow-witted\u2026 Lowering his head, he saw the pair of grinning and wretched leather shoes once again\u2026The 15-year old depressed teenager felt nothing but frustration.Seeing Miss Daina leave, Zhang Tie felt the beautiful shadow was becoming increasingly far away from him. At this moment, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t even feel like following her silently for a distance. He stood outside the bakery and stared at those passersby. He finally finished the remaining loaf of bread with one bite after another. Then, in a sluggish manner, he walked towards the commercial area that was located in the eastern parts of Blackhot City. His parents had found him a part-time apprentice job through someone they knew. He had to work two hours a day for two days a week before going back home\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Naturally, since Blackhot City was founded by the Coal, Steel, and Iron Federation (CSIF), Blackhot City had a rich commercial atmosphere.Its commercial areas were naturally located in the best place downtown; it was far away from the production area and in the upper eastern region. The commercial area in Blackhot City was very prosperous. Bulk commodities exchanges were established in the prosperous sections of the commercial region, and any trade volume there would make commoners scared. Rich coal, iron, and steel in Blackhot City made it a prosperous city. There would always be trains that carried the specialties outside of Blackhot City around the clock.The small grocery store that Zhang Tie worked for was also located in the prosperous commercial area of Blackhot City; however, it was much more remote and shabby compared to the magnificent facades and barracks of the large-scale business groups, free trade bodies, and exchanges.As the railway station was less than three hundred meters away from the store, its guests were from all walks of life. The store was close to a flea market that was founded spontaneously by local residents and foreign pioneers. It was very noisy every day. From the way they dressed, most people here were in the lower-middle class. People struggled to survive here. The people here hoped to become the very vendor in folk fairy tales who found a special object and became rich of it. Those fairy tales also encouraged groups of uninformed pioneers who traveled from afar to enter the unknown lands west and north of Blackhot City with their chests raised high. Naturally, if one had enough luck and foresight, they could also buy good items here.When Zhang Tie arrived at the grocery store, Donder, the fat owner, was huddled up on a lounge chair outside the store. He was enjoying the sunset afterglow and peered at the passersby with half-closed eyes. Unless a plump or beautiful woman passed by the grocery store, he wouldn\u2019t even slightly move his head. In the event that one passes by, he would always watch them walk off for a long distance.As usual, Zhang Tie\u2019s first task was to clean the store. Next, he had to check and clean the counter. Finally, he would adeptly calculate on an abacus. After a year of practice at the grocery store, Zhang Tie\u2019s largest achievement was that he now knew how to use the weird mathematical tool known as the abacus. This was a really practical skill that he had never learned at school. Zhang Tie always thought that it would be helpful for his development later on in life, as his father had always planned for him to be the bookkeeper at the Blackhot Coal Exchange. Naturally, he didn\u2019t need to think about it until he finished his military services. For commoners, It was satisfactory to find a job in the downtown area after serving the army, no matter the job.The moment he finished bookkeeping, a guest entered. Before the fat Donder sat up, Zhang Tie had already closed his accounting book and started to greet the guest.\u201cExcuse me, sir. What can I do for you?\u201d asked Zhang Tie. The guest was a 40-odd year man who wore the uniform of porters from the Blackhot Railway Station and smelt of coal ash. Zhang Tie guessed that he was a passerby, as it was the closing time in downtown.\u201cI\u2019d like to see some white crystals!\u201d said the porter while skimming through the cases containing crystals on the counter. Most of them were common Class-I crystals while there were also some Class-II crystals. White crystals accounted for the highest percentage among all crystals. Some white crystals were natural, while others were artificially created. Compared to the crystals with the same size and quality, double-headed crystals were usually more expensive than single-headed crystals, and natural crystals were much more expensive than artificial crystals, although the latter looked more beautiful. Nevertheless, given the effect, artificial crystals were still poorer than natural ones. It was said that crystals were just used for decoration before the Catastrophe. During that time, people had not known that crystals could be used to help humans cultivate. The usage of crystals had become a common sense that even street vendors knew about. Crystals in this age were a standard strategic material which supported the lives of many.\u201cIs this all that you have?\u201d the forty-odd year man seemed a little bit disappointed. It seemed that he was not satisfied with these common commodities. Zhang Tie was slightly amazed by his expression since even common Class-I crystals were not cheap for commoners.\u201cWe have something better, but they are more expensive. Do you want to have a look?\u201dWith a smile on his face, the man casually patted his waist pack. Zhang Tie knew what the man meant. He put on a pair of white gloves and took out a more delicate case from a container drawer behind him. Zhang Tie placed it on the counter carefully and opened the case in front of the man. The case contained four white crystals, two of them being double-headed crystals while the rest were single-headed crystals. They were crystal clear with little impurity. However, what was most attractive about the crystal was the hazy and pyramid-like fine sand in each crystal. The two larger two-headed crystals contained the better pyramids. When observed carefully, each side of the pyramid shined mysteriously. It was the divine workmanship between the heaven, the earth, and the natural combination of the energy in the universe. Not only could white pyramid crystals help the user enter meditation quickly, but it also enabled its user to absorb the energy from the universe faster and arouse their physical potential and vitality.As expected, much like Zhang Tie when he first saw them, the forty-odd year man didn\u2019t want to avert his gaze when he saw the pyramid-based crystal. Class-III crystals were the highest-end commodity in the store; each crystal\u2019s market price was more than two gold coins. In Blackhot City, a single gold coin could sustain a family of three for two months.The price of each crystal was marked beneath it. When the man saw the price of the crystal, he became hesitant and pointed at the single-headed crystal. \u201cIs it possible\u2026 for the price to be lowered?\u201d\u201c218 silver coins is the lowest price we can afford. Our commodities are all marked honestly. Pardon, sir, are you buying this as a present?\u201d\u201cEn? my son will be sixteen next year, and I want to give him a surprise. He\u2019s a genius!\u201d saying this, the forty-odd year man smiled with warmth and pride on his face which reminded Zhang Tie of his own father.\u201cWell, 215 silver coins, and I will gift you a packing case and 100g of crystal sand. This is the lowest price we can provide\u2026\u201d explained Zhang Tie honestly. As the 40-odd year porter might have been introduced by a friend, he might have understood the situation and the reputation of this general store and knew that this was a very fairy price in Blackhot City. Given the bonuses, he agreed instantly.The man carefully took out his purse from his clothes and paid with two gold coins and fifteen silver coins before he left with the commodities and presents that were well packed by Zhang Tie. A business worth more than two gold coins was big even for the store.The store\u2019s luck might have been used up because besides two loiterers, there was no more business an hour after the man had left.Zhang Tie sat behind the counter with his hands supporting his jaw as he watched the street outside and thought about the events that transpired today.The sun had finally set, and darkness had arrived. The dead fish on the lounge chair moved and twisted as he stood up reluctantly and moved his chair back into the store.\u201cWhat\u2019s happened? Did you get beaten up today?\u201dThe boss smiled pleasantly when he saw the wounds on Zhang Tie\u2019s face.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I fell!\u201d responded Zhang Tie.\u201cWell, boy, no more pretending. It\u2019s nothing serious. When I was your age, I also got into fights often. Beat or beaten, it was normal. Fight back when you lose!\u201d Donder lectured him generously.The only thing in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind was his stupid look when Miss Daina saw him. Hearing what Donder said, he couldn\u2019t help but murmur, \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t fight back?\u201d\u201cBoy, so you\u2019re a green bird. You can always fight back. Only idiots and good-for-nothings dare not to win. If your opponent is stronger than you, then you have to surpass him with ten times more effort. Then, you can beat him with a more powerful strength. If you can\u2019t reach their level, you\u2019ll have to play tricks. Under the mask, you have to beat them stealthily!\u201d the boss lectured him while making gestures. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s idiotic look, the boss seemed to be dissatisfied. He patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder heavily. \u201cBoy, I think that you\u2019re clever, so I\u2019ll teach you what I\u2019ve learned in my life over the past dozen years. When you can\u2019t fight your opponents with your fists, then you have to compensate in this way\u2026\u201d pointing at Zhang Tie\u2019s head, he raised his head high. \u201cListen! A soft tongue is sharper than any weapon as it can even break hard bones and smart brains!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe last words of Donder slightly moved Zhang Tie; he felt that it was reasonable. \u201cWho\u2019s proverb is that?\u201d\u201cDonder!\u201d\u201cLiar, I don\u2019t believe you!\u201d\u201cWhatever, erm. I will not provide you supper as usual!\u201d Donder added meanly.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thinking of Donder\u2019s words, 'soft tongue is sharper than any weapon as it can break hard bones and smart brains!\u201d, the depressed teenager felt a bit better.When Zhang Tie passed the flea market, carbide lamps along the street were ignited one by one. Lamplighters in the Blackhot City were shaking bells on their four-wheelers and parked them in front of each lamp. They climbed onto the poles, removed the lampshades, added fuel, and ignited them. When they left, sexy women with half exposed breasts appeared under the shadows of carbide lamps close to the railway station as the passersby ogled. A couple of those women gathered and talked about something to their companions. Following that, some of them laughed presumptuously and madly.Zhang Tie walked and peered at those women under lamps. They made him upset and gradually aroused his desire.\u201cBaby, come here to your aunt. Let me teach you how to be a man\u2026\u201d a forty-odd year plump and enchanting woman with red curly hair greeted him at the end of the alley beside a lamp pole. Zhang Tie could see her clearly. Looking into Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes, the woman slightly lowered herself so that Zhang Tie could notice her magnificent white breasts. She squeezed the two exposed balls outside the collar and groaned slightly, \u201cMmm\u2026\u201d. She then opened her mouth and slowly licked one finger. Seeing this, Zhang Tie felt that a muscle in his throat was shaking like a rubber band, his blood had rushed to his brain, and his crotch instantly rose up. Zhang Tie escaped under the lecherous laughter of the women.The flea market beside the railway station became really noisy at night. People from all walks of life appeared when the darkness arrived. Zhang Tie recovered his composure when he was almost 100 meters away from that terrifying and alluring woman; however, the untamed thing was still raising high. In order to avoid embarrassment, Zhang Tie had to pretend to hide his hands in his pockets so as to press down the wild thing.The moment Zhang Tie walked out of the flea market, a voice from a roadside stall slowed him down.\u201cBoss, you got all these things from the ruins?\u201d\u201cOf course, look at this book. The characters on it are Chinese and Andaman City-States Alliance has no such publishing. Look at its cover. it\u2019s an abacus from a Chinese clan, a computing tool that could date back to several thousand years before the catastrophe. How could it be preserved so well if not from the ruins?\u201d\u201cWe are not idiots, I also know that this is Chinese; however, nobody recognizes it. Bullshit, what motherf**king abacus. Nobody uses such an antique at all\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you the truth\u2026\u201dZhang Tie was attracted by the word \u201cChinese\u201d. He moved over towards the stall and squatted together with the other two in front of the roadside stall. Many things were placed on a water-proof cloth in a disorganized way. The cloth was no larger than two square meters. The only attractive goods were daggers and copper wrist guards on the four corners of the cloth. In the flea market, each stall owner would declare that their odd goods were from the ruins after the Catastrophe, and even idiots would never trust their words\u2026One of the two beside him purchased a nice sheathed dagger for 8 silver coins and 60 copper coins. Then, the two went away, leaving Zhang Tie alone.The stall owner was a sixty-odd year obscene man with a red brandy nose. Once Zhang Tie spoke to him, he could directly smell the smell of hedge wine. The old man reminded him of an animal \u2014 a mouse.After Zhang Tie glanced over the stall casually, he took an abacus book and asked, \u201cHow much?\u201d\u201cThis is a treasure from the ruins, so at least twenty silver coins\u2026 \u201d replied the old man treacherously.\u201cWhat\u2019s it used for?\u201d\u201cWell, it may be a technical book on how to compute using an abacus!\u201d the old man was also not sure about it. He had read it, but didn\u2019t understand its contents at all. He also invited an alleged expert to authenticate it; however, the expert could only identify some simple numbers inside. The contents were strange number arrangements like three three two two five five six six\u2026\u201cWhat is it used for? Teach me how to count sheep to fall asleep?\u201d\u201cErm, well\u2026 Sixteen silver coins, no less!\u201d the old man added reluctantly.\u201cDo I look like an idiot? The book is no more than sixteen pages in total which is not even enough for me to clean shit. You want sixteen silver coins? No way! I just asked about it out of curiosity,\u201d Zhang Tie threw the book angrily. He was familiar with the flea market. If he didn\u2019t bargain aggressively, he would be ripped off by them.\u201cSo how much can you afford?\u201d\u201cEighty copper coins!\u201d\u201cEighty copper coins?\u201d the old man sprung up like a mouse having its tail stepped on. \u201cBoy, at least ten silver coins. I got this out of the ruins!\u201d\u201cWhat motherf*cking ruins, I am not an idiot. There is no ruins within one thousand kilometer radius of Blackhot city. Even if there truly were some, they would have long been removed. It was never your turn. Eighty copper coins!\u201d\u201cNine silver coins, no less!\u201d\u201cWell, as I respect you, ten more copper coins! \u201d\u201cNinety copper coins?\u201d exclaimed the old man like a pig being slaughtered. \u201cIt\u2019s even lower than my price!\u201d\u201cOne silver coin!\u201d\u201cSeven!\u201d the old man gritted his teeth\u2026After a ferocious bargaining for two minutes, Zhang Tie directly stood up and left instantly. Surprisingly, the old man shouted anxiously after Zhang Tie took five steps, \u201cNo, don\u2019t leave. As you said, pay me four silver coins and the book is yours!\u201dA slight smile appeared on Zhang Tie\u2019s mouth. Naturally, those outsiders didn\u2019t know the name of the book; however, Zhang Tie was stunned when he saw it \u2014 <mental>. He skimmed over it and found a mental arithmetic method that was related to the abacus. He thought it was special and decided to buy it\u2026</mental>On the way home, Zhang Tie\u2019s stomach was already growling; however, Zhang Tie was satisfied when he touched the book in his pocket. In this age, knowledge was expensive and any skill or knowledge acquired outside the school gate was unique and precious. Zhang Tie remembered that Donder watched him for more than three months before he taught him how to use the strange thing known as the abacus. Even then, he still felt reluctant to teach him. Whereas, Zhang Tie found that only a few people in the Blackhot City knew how to use the abacus. Ordinary calculations were usually made on paper. As for superior calculation methods, there were metal hand-driven calculators in exchanges and commercial firms. Thus, the abacus seemed useless. Still, it was a special skill that could not be easily gained. When Zhang Tie noticed the abacus pattern and pithy formula on the title page of the book, he recognized the value of this book. Generally speaking, Zhang Tie thought it was worth the price. Even if its value couldn\u2019t be seen for now, Zhang Tie still felt it was valuable, let alone the fact that those silver coins weren\u2019t even his to begin with.\u201cLearn more, at least it\u2019s not harmful to you,\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad always taught him when he was young.His parents had always forced him to learn Chinese by slapping his hand with a bamboo clapper when he was young. It took him ten years to recognize all characters on the big-headed Chinese dictionary; it was Zhang Tie\u2019s darkest period. A dozen years later, today, Zhang Tie finally found what he had learned to be useful. He was a little pleased about this experience.Zhang Tie never trusted the old man\u2019s word when he said that this book was from the ruins. As goods from the ruins were at least one thousand years old, this book doesn\u2019t seem that old. He suddenly found several gloomy Chinese characters under the abacus pattern, \u201cRecommended afterclass reading for students\u201d. \u201cI almost ready to enter society, yet I don\u2019t know about this at all. What students?! After-class reading?! Comparisons are unpleasant!\u201dAfter being beaten inexplicably, he joined the brotherhood and lost face in front of Miss Daina. Besides that, he used his war trophy to buy a book.On the way home, Zhang Tie recalled that he had spent money and gained money today; he didn\u2019t even know whether he earned or lost today\u2026 Zhang Tie\u2019s house was in the commoners gathering area north of Blackhot City. When the upper eastern area in Blackhot City was the backyard garden of the rich, the northern areas were the cozy nests of the regular workers and citizens. Compared with the upper eastern areas, blocks in the northern area were not beautiful; however, they were tidy and safe. The parasol trees on the two sides of streets here made it somewhat warm and ordinary. Through a dozen years of effort, his parents could only afford a building with less than 100 square meters on one side of a street. The building was attached with a small log cabin in the backyard. His parents opened a roadside rice brew [1] store in the room downstairs. His dad was a worker in the mill, while his mother ran this store. The business was so-so as it was mainly taken care of by neighboring households, and the thin profit could only slightly improve their quality of life.When Zhang Tie returned home, it was almost 9pm. His parents were not at home; he guessed that they were at church. The rice brew store was also closed. Supper was in warm water to keep the food warm. It contained a pot of mixed vegetables, a bowl of bacon braised with kidney beans, and a huge bowl of cooked white rice. A few slices of broad bean-like sliced bacon could be seen on top of the kidney beans. This was specifically left by his parents who always said that they didn\u2019t like them as an excuse. Eating the supper, Zhang Tie felt somewhat moved. He vowed to himself that when he became rich in the future, he would provide enough fish and meat for his parents everyday.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe finished supper quickly and cleaned the kitchen. With a fatigued body, he went upstairs. When he arrived at the second floor, he could hear the rhythmed clashes and evidently depressed breath from his elder brother\u2019s room, although the door was closed. This was not the first time, and Zhang Tie naturally knew what was happening. Silently passing, he moved to the hallway. At the end of the hallway, Zhang Tie touched the rope on the wall and slightly pulled it down. Then, a wooden plank glided from the ceiling at the end of the hallway, and a flight of stairs appeared on the other side of the plank which directly connected to the above attic.These days, the pulley might be in need of lubricating oil, as there was a big creak when the flight of stairs was lowered. The rhythmed clashing from his brother\u2019s room stopped for a few seconds before it continued more violently than before Zhang Tie had climbed up.He finally reached the top and pulled the stairs back to reset the plank. The tiny attic with a triangular roof belonged to Zhang Tie.The house was not large, and with a rice brew store opened downstairs, less space was available; therefore, Zhang Tie had no other choices but to live in the attic. Almost half of the tiny space was occupied by iron sheets and planks for sundries. As a result, the rest space was only available for a bed, a desk, and a small wardrobe. There was only enough space for one person to move in. The paint on the furniture had already started to fade. They were all second-hand commodities that Zhang Tie bought in the flea market and were worth less than two silver coins in total\u2026A room smaller than eight square meters and several second-hand furnitures were all that the miserable 15-year old teenager owned\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_The only natural source of light in the attic was from the triangular window at the foot of Zhang Tie\u2019s bed. It was a little bit bright in the daytime, but when night fell, the attic was dim just like it was now.With the faint moonlight outside and his familiarity with the attic, Zhang Tie lit the oil lamp inside the attic. In order to save oil, Zhang Tie lowered the lamp flame to the smallest possible. Hence, the soybean-sized flame flickered as it brought some light and warmth to the attic.After adjusting the lamp, Zhang Tie directly threw himself onto the bed without removing his shoes. He stared at the sharply pointed roof with the faint light and noticed a small web woven by a spider in the corner of the beam. Gazing at the poor spider and its web that could hardly capture a fly, Zhang Tie instantly felt pitiful.The shaking of bed boards downstairs became clearer as Zhang Tie laid down, which made It harder for Zhan Tie to cultivate. Lying on the bed bored, Zhang Tie tossed and turned; his heart felt like it was being scratched at by a cat. He was bored to the point that he began to count the shaking from his elder brother\u2019s room downstairs. When it came to around 700, the sound accelerated all of a sudden, and dozens of seconds later, everything returned to silence. Zhang Tie then gasped and recovered his composure; however, Zhang Tie himself was amazed, as he had found his right hand holding on to the untamed thing below him. It was already very hard. It seemed that he had already unconsciously done the manual one-cylinder piston movement for quite a while.Could it be that he had been affected by the members of the brotherhood?He pulled out his right hand from the trousers as if he had touched a red-hot metal and recovered his composure after some time. Unlike the others, Zhang Tie especially felt guilty about what he did. His father once talked to him about this topic solemnly when he was twelve. As the Chinese clan was shorter and smaller than other clans physically, the average Chinese soldier didn\u2019t have the advantage in traits like speed and endurance. However, in this age, it was evident that physical differences between soldiers and their opponents were always fatal, especially between soldiers between LV1 \u2013 LV3, and normal soldiers. Take Zhang Tie for example, he was well developed for being in the Chinese clan; however, in school, Zhang Tie was slightly below average in both height and physical strength. In the brotherhood, Zhang Tie reluctantly admits that he\u2019s similar to the pudgy Barley and Sharwin in height, but Barley was much fatter and stronger than Zhang Tie. The physical difference between the Chinese clan and other clans would be very clear before they became true soldiers. Although the higher the rank the solder the less important the physical difference would be, physical disparity seemed like a huge gap that could never be overcome.In Blackhot City, in order to narrow down the physical differences between the Chinese clans and others, the most important thing was to quickly become a soldier and raise your rank so as to protect yourself. The higher the rank the less physical difference there would be. The wider the future road the easier you would survive in this world. However, in order to become a Lv 1 soldier and constantly improve your occupational rank, the more important it was to ignite the meditation flame on each burning point inside the body. Everybody had to experience it. In this age where all clans fought against each other, it was the most important standard used to measure personal value. Physical quality was critical for burning the meditation flames and each manual one-cylinder piston movement would damage the health of the teenager, as it might consume a lot of energy and vitality which would make it harder to ignite meditation flames. Teenagers who always made that movement would be weak both physically and mentally.\u201cMasturbation is a chronic suicide process that is hardly observed; therefore, whatever others do, you should never be influenced. There are legends that anyone being obsessed with this will damage his health, be unfortunate, and live a poor life!\u201d as his father ended with this, he made Zhang Tie promise to never be influenced by this malicious habit as he heaved a deep sigh\u2026Of course, as for what happened last night, his father explained, \u201cWhen seminal fluid is full, it overflows automatically.\u201d He told him that this was a natural phenomenon and wouldn\u2019t damage his physique too much.When his father\u2019s admonition came to mind, Zhang Tie hurriedly pulled out his hand. Thankfully, he hadn\u2019t violated the rule too much. He recovered his composure after a period of time before getting off the bed and moving towards the window. Peering out the window, he saw his elder brother leaving the house with a woman. He had already put on the uniform of the city guards of Blackhot City and was sending the woman home. Judging from her shadow, she should have been the daughter of Mr. Wang, the boss of the tailor store on this street.Feeling someone watching him, his elder brother turned his head, raised his jaw, and smiled at Zhang Tie, who was peering out the window. Zhang Tie pretended to flick his fists as he saw them off in the dimly lit street. A handful of crystal sand was placed on a small plate by the windowsill. An ordinary double-headed white crystal was in the crystal sand. The crystal was naturally born and was barely qualified to be a low quality Class-2 crystal. It could be changed in the crystal sand just like a battery before the Catastrophe; however, it was much more convenient than a battery. Although the Class-2 double-headed crystal could never match the pyramid-based one Zhang Tie sold today, it was still the best cultivation material that Zhang Tie had.With the crystal in hand, Zhang Tie took off his shoes and sat on the bed with his legs crossed, as if he was doing yoga. Ignoring the weird odor from his feet, he put his hand in front of his stomach and aimed one end of the double-headed crystal to his navel. He then closed his eyes and began to cultivate.The process of cultivation was simple yet boring. Firstly, one had to slow their breathing and gather their spirit and consciousness to their navel, following the \u201cQi\u201d that they inhaled. This process was repeated until they touched the existence of the burning point in the 'shrine\u201d in the navel. After touching it, \u201crub\u201d this burning point with your spirit and consciousness in a rhythm and gaze at it like a fly on a rotten meat until one day, the flame of meditation at this burning point would be ignited, symbolizing that they were now a Lv1 fighter and an adult.In this age, if a man could not even ignite the meditation flame at the burning point in the 'shrine\u201d, then he would be seen as disabled and slow-witted. This was the law of survival in the Age of Black Iron.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Tie felt that the point in the navel was like a piece of gold underneath the sands. When he was in meditation, he firstly swept the sands using a broom to show the burning point. His consciousness was like sandpaper which he used to constantly rub and polish the piece of gold until one day, he would burn it like drilling wood to make fire. Then, he did it\u2026He learned to how to cultivate from school. It started back in preliminary school where he could learn the method for free. As his teacher always said, the burning point was the largest secret on the human body. Besides the visible burning point in the navel called the 'shrine\u201d, other burning points were all invisible and could never be touched without reaching higher levels. However, even now, people could still not figure out how many burning points there were on a human being, and what these mysterious burning points were used for. It was still a secret on how to explore and touch more burning points on the human body, and how to accelerate the cultivation of these burning points for everyone everywhere. The powerful sects, schools, shrines, and legendary fighters were all safeguards and the beneficiaries of this secret.Almost a fifth of all the people in Blackhot City could only ignite the meditation flame on the first burning point at the 'shrine\u201d throughout their lives\u2026For commoners like Zhang Tie, it was extremely difficult to enter meditation. He had to constantly adjust his breath to reach it. After half an hour, Zhang Tie entered meditation and finally touched the shrine burning point in the navel. He then began to inject his spirit and consciousness into this burning point constantly. Zhang Tie felt his navel start to generate heat slowly. The burning point gradually showed up, and finally, being \u201cpolished\u201d by his spirit and awareness, it slowly grew brighter and brighter. The light finally became as large as a grain of rice as it shone blue. Meanwhile, the crystal in his hand was linked to the burning point after the burning point was ignited. It was an energy that would usually never be touched. At this time, the energy was slowly injected into the burning point from one end of the crystal. Influenced by his spirit, consciousness, and the crystal, the blue light gradually became brighter and brighter. The light started to gradually brighten up the surrounding darkness like a star in the pitch night sky. Although it was faint, it always brought him a beacon of hope.After a long while, Zhang Tie felt that his spirit and consciousness had already been dried up and exhausted. He had reached his limit, and thus, he woke from his meditation. With several hours of practice a day, he could barely feel any evident progress. For Zhang Tie, he could not feel the progress without several weeks or months worth of accumulation. He evidently felt the change of the color of the burning point. In these years, Zhang Tie had experienced red, orange, yellow, green, and indigo from the beginning of his cultivation. He had to reach blue and purple before igniting the meditation flame. It would take him one and a half year to accomplish the other stages according to experience. His cultivation speed was almost even with most commoners who would ignite their meditation flame in the shrine on the first year in the army post graduation, which was the most important point in their lives.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhang Tie and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood familiarized with one another. Thankfully, none of the other members in the brotherhood did any manual single-cylinder piston movements at school any more. The change might be attributed to their promise to Zhang Tie or the risk of being caught doing that movement. Although Zhang Tie was still very weak, he was already satisfied by being able to protect Miss Daina this way. In comparison, Glaze, who would always bully the weak at the school cafeteria, was still arrogant; however, he truly had to strength to do that. In the test organized by the school last week, Glaze almost broke all the records made by the students at the school. His records made all the other male students desperate. The differences between a Lv 2 professional fighter and an average person could easily be seen.Zhang Tie was happy that he was not the one who had his spot in the line stolen by Glaze in the cafeteria. Including Zhang Tie, Glaze brought a huge pressure to everybody. Zhang Tie thought to himself everyday about what would he do in the future if someone wanted to destroy something that he wanted to protect but didn\u2019t have the strength to overcome them. This huge pressure made Zhang Tie very lively. Besides training hard and learning at school, he also tried to save time to strengthen himself when he returned home. For Zhang Tie, the earlier he could light the meditation flame in the shrine, the earlier he could protect himself.In reality, every undergraduate boy at the Seventh National Middle School had been exerting their utmost best. Because this was their last semester at school, they had to practice outside the school gates in the second half of the school year. Speaking of where the students trained, the city\u2019s army safeguarded Blackhot City and the surrounding farming villages as well as the arterial roads and mines where the students trained in. There was no danger when they practiced downtown, but if they were to practice elsewhere, someone would lose their life. Once they left the protection of the high walls of Blackhot City, they would hardly be able to find a safe place because of the wild and dangerous variant living beings and crypt fiends that would kill them at any moment. Besides, the legend that gays in the city army liked fresh trainees had been popularized amongst undergraduates from the Seventh National Middle School for many years.No struggle, no life \u2014 the pet phrase of Captain Kerlin and the true reflection of this age.\u201cAttack, add more strength. Did you not eat lunch? Attack, add more strength\u2026\u201d the roars of the coach were drifting in the training ground in the afternoon. \u201cBastards, hold your spear tightly even if it was a red iron rod. You have no power even the women are stronger than you\u2026\u201dSweating, Zhang Tie repetitively exercised the attacking movements dully under the hot sun. Two hours later, the spear body made of hollow steel had become very hot. The blisters that had formed on his palms were broken repeatedly. Being stimulated by his sweat and wounded by the scorching spear body, he felt like he was holding red-hot charcoal and felt like he was being pricked by needles. However, seeing the coach who was standing upright like a javelin on the training ground under the sun with a solemn face, Zhang Tie had no choice but to grit his teeth and convert all the pain in his body into an angry growl \u2014 \u201cKill!\u201d. Raising his chest, he strode forward and attacked like a machine without knowing what being tired meant. In the students\u2019 eyes, the most hateful guy\u2019s records motivated them to work harder than the coach\u2019s orders. As a tradition at the school, all the records of the strongest person in each group of undergraduates would be recorded on the high platform in the training ground in red words for the worship of others. This was a form of encouragement \u2014 to be precise, it encouraged increasing aggression for others\u2026Glaze\u2014\u2014100 m\u2014\u201410.3sBench press\u2014\u2014160 kgDeep squatting\u2014\u2014310 kgExplosive punch\u2014\u2014 Right fist: 510 kg ; Left fist: 340 kgMaximum stamping explosive force\u2014\u2014780 kgMaximum number of continual armor-breaking attacks\u2014\u2014137 timesEndurance\u2014\u201413\u2014\u2014 The endurance value referred to the maximum effective power transmission distance at the standard speed with regular battle equipment, using kilometers as the distance unit. Although it sounded somewhat complex, it was the most accurate explanation. The endurance indicator was also a measure of the maximum tactic moving radius for the pikemen matrix on the battlefield. The maximum effective combat capability referred to the maximum personal combat capability that remained after three minutes of rest following a rapid march. The value should be more than half of the total personal combat capability. Glaze\u2019s endurance value was 13 which meant that he could still accomplish more than 69 armor-breaking attacks or could deal an attack with a force of 250 kg using his right hand after rapid marching for 13 km in standard battle equipment.Those are the indicators of a LV 2 fighter!The words on the high platform were still fresh. The scarlet words seemed as if it was mocking everyone beneath it. Since Glaze\u2019s name and data were written two weeks ago, the training ground became increasingly aggressive. Nobody would like to give up at this point.On the day Glaze\u2019s name appeared on the high platform, the coach shouted at them coldly, \u201cYou either die or live on the battlefield. There is no good or evil, am I clear?\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself, \u201cThe people who survive the battlefield are the good ones.\u201dAfter two hours of spear training, what waited for them was the 10 km armored march at a moderate speed. Finishing the last task, Zhang Tie\u2019s feet felt as soft as scotton. He found shade under a tree and gasped for quite a while like a dog. Zhang Tie failed to stand up while the other members of the brotherhood tilted themselves and sat on the ground. Besides Doug and Barley, Bagdad was the strongest one in the brotherhood; he was even one of the strongest in the school. By contrast, Doug looked special today. Today, he was especially thrilled as he kept drooling with a foolish grin during the class. When they trained in spear attacks, Zhang Tie occasionally saw that guy. Although he looked tired to death, the crotch of his trousers were raised like a tent. Zhang Tie was really shocked by this scene. What the f*ck! Was it that exciting to practice spear skills? Zhang Tie was really shocked!Finishing the run, Glaze and his followers passed in front of Zhang Tie with their heads raised proudly. They even peered over most of the commoners laying on the training ground.\u201cTrash!\u201d Glaze seemed to mouth. Zhang Tie was absent-mindedly trying to figure out what he had said. When he found out what was said, he clenched his teeth. When Zhang Tie recovered a bit after ten minutes of rest, he saw the pudgy Barley moving towards him quiveringly and squatted in front of him. \u201cDo you have any plans after school?\u201d he said in a low voice.\u201cI have a part-time job at the grocery store that I go to twice a week!\u201d\u201cAre you a virgin?\u201dHearing this, Zhang Tie instantly became irritated, \u201cF*ck, I am a virgin, so what! You\u2019re the same!\u201d\u201cWrong, after today, you\u2019ll be the only virgin among all the brotherhood members!\u201d Barley replied calmly. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t even notice Barley\u2019s compassionate look at that moment.\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t think it through for a while.\u201cYou will understand after school. It\u2019s a benefit for the members of our Hit-Plane Brotherhood. It\u2019s Doug\u2019s turn today, so I will arrange it for you next time\u2026\u201d saying this, Barley patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders, stood up, and left, leaving Zhang Tie with his head spinning for quite a while.Today was a special day. Walking out of the school gates with the other members, Zhang Tie noticed that Bagdad and the other members were bidding farewell to Doug solemnly at the school gate. Each one bidding farewell to him would bend their arms around Doug\u2019s shoulders and say something to him before making a lecherous laugh. Doug was also thrilled; his ears were even red. Zhang Tie could only hear something gloomily like \u201cif you wash your mouth, you would get a surprised\u201d. When it was Bagdad\u2019s turn, his voice was loud enough that Zhang Tie finally heard what they were saying. \u201cIt\u2019s fast for the first time. Spirit up, you have enough time that you can make love many times. When I was there, I did it seven times\u2026\u201dThey patted shoulders and embraced each other as the last couple of guys bidded farewell to Doug with a lecherous expression. Hista wanted to follow Doug but was pulled away by Bagdad and Leit.Zhang Tie had no words to explain what had just happened. Barely said that it was an activity of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood and suggested Zhang Tie to watch if he was free. Zhang Tie asked about the whereabouts and knew Barley and Doug were heading for some place past the railway station. In the end, he went along with them.On the way, Doug was both thrilled and nervous. He kept asking Barley strange questions.\u201cAlthough I took a bath last night, I sweated a lot today, is it ok?\u201d\u201cHave you changed your underclothes and underwear?\u201d\u201cYes, I changed them last night after my bath!\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s ok!\u201d\u201cBut Hista said there would be a surprise if I washed my mouth before going there!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve already prepared this for you!\u201d Barley replied and took out a small paper parcel from his pocket solemnly. The paper parcel was well packed and made Doug and Zhang Tie especially curious. He stretched his neck and found three or four slim leaves inside.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Doug asked curiously.\u201cThese are expensive tea leaves. I stole them from my father. They were give to my father by others as a gift. We treasure it very much, as they were only produced in Eastern Continent. Here you are, put them in your mouth like this and don\u2019t chew or swallow them. They are much more effective than washing your mouth.Barley carefully took the leaves and put them into Doug\u2019s mouth. Doug held them tightly in his mouth, saying nothing. He was afraid of dropping them when he spoke.\u201cHow many times can I make love with her?\u201d after a while, Doug asked another question.\u201cYou can make as many times as you can within three hours!\u201d\u201cCan I use the bottom hole?\u201d Doug asked another question like a curious baby several minutes later.\u201cBottom\u2026\u201d Barley was really shocked, \u201cWho told you?\u201d\u201cMy brother\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 can\u2019t do this. Hista and the others didn\u2019t try that!\u201d\u201cErm!\u201d With tea leaves in mouth, Doug recovered his composure once again. After a few seconds, in order to safeguard his authority, Barley explained solemnly, \u201cIt\u2019s very expensive to use that hole. Yeah, very expensive and not healthy\u2026Zhang Tie had already realized what would happen, but out of curiosity and his increasing male hormones, he followed Barley and Doug all the way from school to the old slum neighboring the railway station. They wandered in the low alley for almost four minutes before arriving in front of a vermeil door. Compared with the surrounding gates that were evidently broken, this place was much cleaner. Standing outside the door, when Barley knocked the door, a couple of people passed by and stared at them. It felt strange. Zhang Tie felt fleas jumping on his face, which made him itchy.Although he didn\u2019t know what was behind the door, Zhang Tie guessed it must be very stimulating and became nervous as well. Doug was already sweating at this point. Hearing somebody vomiting, Zhang Tie turned and found it was Doug\u2026 Doug was constantly digging for something inside his mouth. Barley was also startled, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong!?\u201d\u201cI was nervous\u2026 and swallowed those tea leaves\u2026 When I swallowed, It felt really uncomfortable\u2026\u201d\u201cIdiot\u2026\u201d Barley verbally abused and patted his own head painfully with a hand, \u201ctoo shameful, no more drinking. Have a drink and flush it off when you enter!\u201d\u201cWoo\u2026\u201d Doug kept acting like he was vomitingWith his eyes opened widely, Zhang Tie saw Doug\u2019s face turn red, and then his veins stood out and thickened. It seemed liked something wanted to exit his throat. His mouth bulged as he tried to keep his mouth closed. Covering his mouth, he finally swallowed it back down\u2026\u201cWell, it\u2019s fine. I swallowed them. Thankfully, I solved the problem instantly!\u201d patting his chest, Doug seemed like he survived a robbery. He then grinned shamefully and exposed a vegetable leaf on his teeth that was half digested.Zhang Tie turned pale. Feeling disgusted, Zhang Tie thought to himself, \u201cYou\u2019re really great!\u201d When Doug spoke now, Zhang Tie could smell the gastric acid, which was really disgusting. Barley was also shocked, as he had never dreamed that Doug would solve the problem in this manner\u2026Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t stand it any more. His curiosity and hormone both disappeared at this moment. \u201cHave fun, I will leave first!\u201dBarley quickly took out four silver coins from his pocket and put them in Doug\u2019s hand. \u201cYou enter by yourself. Remember, don\u2019t tell her I brought you here and don\u2019t say you know me either!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Tie and Barley ran away instantly and hid somewhere. Doug was left alone scratching his head outside the door. The vermeil door opened. Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t see anyone, but Doug, who stared straight and showed a 'shameful\u201d smile, greeted, \u201cHello\u2026\u201dThe person who opened the door must have almostly been suffocated to death by Doug.The moment he greeted, the door was shut with a \u201cpeng\u201d. Doug was at a loss of words. After a few seconds, he looked over at Barley and Zhang Tie. Barley showed an encouraging gesture. Doug raised his chest and knocked on the door once again. Doug was still smiling coyly with four silver coins spread in his hands. Seeing his actions, Barley patted his head painfully again. As a result, the door was shut once again with a loud sound.When Doug knocked the door for the third time, Zhang Tie found a basin of water was poured out from inside when the door was opened. Doug became a drowned rat, and the coy smile was frozen at that time\u2026What bad luck!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

By tomorrow, Doug would definitely be the laughingstock in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood after what had happened. He might never be able to eliminate this stain for the rest of his life.When Zhang Tie arrived, Donder was greeting guests in the store, so Zhang Tie just stood to the side. After the guests had left, he moved behind the counter and took the broom, rag, and basin to clean the store. After he finished, he used the abacus to calculate the accounts of the past few days. Ever since Zhang Tie started to work here, he found that Donder was becoming lazier and lazier. It would always take him about an hour to finish his work, and it was the same for today.Seeing Zhang Tie working inside, Donder laid back on his lounge again and kept his eyes closed comfortably.When Zhang Tie remembered the tea leaves, he started a conversation with Donder.\u201cBoss, do you know what tea leaf is?\u201d\u201cTea leaf?\u201d hearing this, Donder turned with a weird expression. He glanced at Zhang Tie, \u201cThat\u2019s a very precious and rare drink. Those rich and powerful bureaucrats, who would like to be civilized and pretended to be stylish, always used tea leaves to show off!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a drink. I saw others put it directly into their mouths\u201d\u201cIdiot, tea leaves should be soaked in boiling water. There\u2019s a lot to learn about tea leaves!\u201d Donder raised his voice, \u201cThose nouveau riche always put tea leaves into mouths to refresh their mouths!\u201d\u201cYou said it was expensive!\u201d \u201cNot only expensive, it\u2019s very expensive. A bag of the lowest-quality tea leaves from outside is worth\u2026!\u201d Donder stretched out his hand. \u201cAs for higher-quality tea leaves, you should never dream about them!\u201d\u201cFive silver coins!\u201d it was already very expensive in Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes.\u201cFive silver coins\u2026\u201d Donder grinned dismissively. \u201cYou could only smell them with five silver coins. Five gold coins! It might even be much more expensive!\u201d Zhang Tie was really shocked. No wonder Barley packed the ugly leaves with paper so carefully. Commoners could never afford it.\u201cSo expensive. Why not plant them in Blackhot City? Then we will make a lot of money!\u201d\u201cIt would never be your turn. They were only planted in the Eastern Continent. Those could do business with tea leaves were large business groups and the chambers of commerce!\u201d\u201cTeacher told us that there were many human countries in the Eastern Continent. Many powerful countries were over there! Some countries even owned thousands of cities like Blackhot City\u2026!\u201d\u201cHick, Blackhot City is nothing compared with those cities that dozens of times bigger. You will understand when you visit them. There are human countries predominated by Chinese clans. When I was young\u2026 \u201d Donder recalled and longer for that experience. He kept talking and Zhang Tie listened to him carefully. What he said should be true when he talked about his arrival at the Eastern Continent and his knowledge of it when he was young. As for the following scenes \u2014 becoming sworn brothers with strong fighters in accordance with the folklores, cooperating with his sworn brothers to beat the alien clans who threw everything away when they fled, discovering valuable relics with pioneers, exploring the underground word with a great wave of beauties and almost being ** by them, seeing numerous diamonds the size of the head and bullions the size of a house, Zhang Tie was sure that they were tales from common knight novels. Therefore, he ignored them.While Donder was boasting about when he was discovering the underground world with a great wave of beauties that wanted to marry him to the point where they cried, two guests entered. They were thirty-odd years with experience faces, unshaven chins, and they wore leather boots, copper-cotton wristbands, and riveted half-body armors. They also hung a long sword on their waist and had a box full of steel crossbow arrows on their back. The shoulder armor matched with the hanging buckle of the wind-proof hooded cloak. They really looked like pioneers. During the past year working at the grocery store, Zhang Tie had cultivated a sharp judgement. They must be new pioneers, as Zhang Tie could tell from their equipment. The new pioneers always wore clothes like professional ones, so as to tell others they were pioneering wastelands. They also usually purchased the entire set when buying equipment.\u201cCan I help you, sir?\u201d Zhang Tie asked politely and professionally.They glanced at Zhang Tie and looked around. They nodded to each other, as the taller man walked towards Zhang Tie, lowered his body, and said in a low voice, \u201cWhere\u2019s your boss? We have business!\u201dThey usually met guests like them. Donder\u2019s grocery store did not only sell goods, but it also purchased goods. Considering their prudence and secretiveness, Donder climbed up from the lounge. While rubbing his hands, he bent his back and walked towards them.\u201cI\u2019m the boss, what\u2019s up!\u201dThe two stared at him for a while and looked at each other, then they nodded silently.\u201cDo you receive things?\u201d\u201cYes, once they are evaluated. If your goods are too expensive and I cannot afford it, I can introduce someone to you. If you agree, I want 5% as an agency fee!\u201d The two pioneers finally surrendered to Donder\u2019s passion. Looking outside meticulously, they found that nobody was watching inside. One of the two lowered himself to block the line of sight from outside, while the other took out a fist-sized metal mineral from a leather bag of sundies and placed it on the counter.The mineral was shining, somewhat like gold. It seemed very expensive and frightening. Zhang Tie opened his mouth, saying nothing, he just waved his head.\u201cThis one\u2026\u201d a pioneer looked at Donder solemnly. \u201cWhat\u2019s your offer? We can establish long-term cooperation with you if you can give us a proper offer!\u201d\u201cA copper coin for five kilograms!\u201d Donder offered.\u201cWhat? Are you kidding?\u201d with eyes widened, the two pioneers looked at Donder angrily.\u201cI mean it. A copper coin for five kilograms!\u201d Donder replied slowly, ignoring the red faces of the two pioneers. The shielding man had been impulsive and put his hand on the sword handle beside his waist.\u201cYou must have mistaken it for gold ore. It\u2019s very beautiful like a gold ore!\u201d hearing this, the two were shocked and nodded. The man with his hand on the sword handle also slightly loosened his grip on the sword.\u201cHoho, some gold ores are truly similar to it. But pitifully, this is not a gold ore, but a common pyrite. That\u2019s why I offered you one copper coin per five kilograms!\u201d\u201cCommon pyrite?\u201d one pioneer took the shining and beautiful ore into his hand and seemed to not trust that it was as rubbish as scrap iron. The other pioneer seemed to doubt Donder\u2019s words. Seeing their expressions, Donder didn\u2019t say anything to the pioneers. Instead, he spoke to Zhang Tie, \u201cTake out the common pyrite sample in the store!\u201d Zhang Tie turned and fetched a dusty bag from a corner of the grocery store.He placed it directly on the ground and showed the contents to them. About ten kilograms of goods were poured out, which looked the same as the ore on the counter. Squatting, they took two common pyrites and compared them to the one on the counter. They became depressed like deflated balloons.\u201cThere is a valley in the Red Highland more than a 100 km southwest of Blackhot City. Did you get the ore from there? They are similar to gold ores. In the past, there were pioneers who treated them as gold ores and were made laughingstocks. Never mind, you might see something new. Nobody is all might and knows everything!\u201d Donder explained. This completely broke the last beacon of hope they two pioneers had. They stood up and gave their thanks to Donder in low spirits. Feeling as if they lost face, they left with their heads lowered. When they walked to the gate of the store, one of the pioneers saw the common pyrite that they treasured and cursed furiously. He smacked the common pyrite onto the ground of the street.\u201cCommon pyrite, idiots\u2019 gold, two more idiots are cheated\u2026\u201d seeing them leaving, Donder shook his head and signed, then went back to the lounge chair.\u201cCommon pyrite, fool\u2019s gold. Two more idiots got cheated\u2026\u201d seeing them leave, Donder shooked his head and sighed before returning to the lounge chair.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLater on, several waves of guests entered and Donder earned more than ten silver coins. As usual, when Donder said, \u201c\u2026 I will not provide you supper according to the agreement!\u201d, Zhang Tie knew it was time for him to leave.\u201cWhat are Doug and Barley doing now?\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself when he walked out of the grocery store.When the dusk drew close, lamplighters were waving bells and lighting lamps on the street. Within ten steps, Zhang Tie abruptly stopped as he saw something shining slightly at the corner of the wall in front of him under the lamp lights\u2026Oh, it was the common pyrite left by the two idiots. At this time, the common pyrite was found to have been smacked into two halves. Zhang Tie moved forward another two steps\u2026Oh, there was something inside the common pyrite. It flashed just now. The color was different from the common pyrite under the lamplight. Zhang Tie was curious and moved closer to it. Bending over, he pretended to squat to tie his shoelaces. When he found nobody around, he picked up the two pieces and placed them in his pockets. There was really something inside! Zhang Tie\u2019s excitement rose\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He held his pocket tightly in fear that the thing would escape. When he picked it up just now, he saw a round object that was smaller than a chicken\u2019s egg in the center of one of the halves of the common pyrite. There seemed to have been a beautiful decorative pattern on it. Nobody would have known that there was something inside the common pyrite if it had not been smashed onto the ground by that pioneer. It was definitely not created naturally. Additionally, it took at least several hundreds of millions of years to form a common pyrite geologically. Zhang Tie was really amazed about the object which entered the common pyrite several hundred million years ago\u2026Several hundred million years ago\u2026Not formed naturally\u2026Beautiful decorative patterns\u2026When the above information appeared in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind, he was really shocked.On the way home, Zhang Tie maintained a normal walking speed at first, but he couldn\u2019t help but run when he was close to home. He continued to hold the common pyrite tightly as he ran. Zhang Tie might have been too nervous, he felt as if the common pyrite in his hand was becoming increasingly hot.When he arrived home, his mom was making rice brew. Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s scurry, she shouted without turning her head, \u201cSupper is ready. It\u2019s still hot, so eat slowly!\u201d\u201cMom, I\u2019ve eaten outside!\u201dAfter their exchange, Zhang Tie rushed upstairs. As his elder brother was not home today, it was much more peaceful now. Lowering the staircase, Zhang Tie dashed into his attic cell. He then pulled up the staircase and plugged in the socket of the floor slab. Lighting the oil lamp, he lowered the curtains and the cold-proof double-layer wooden partition. Zhang Tie was alone in the narrow space and would never fear about being seen by others. He sat on his bed while continually gasping for air.While he was still gasping, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t wait to take out the half piece of common pyrite and put it under the lamplight. His eyes widened\u2026The object wrapped inside the common pyrite was like a small crystal chicken egg that was carved with sophisticated and beautiful patterns. The patterns seemed as if it faintly formed an arched door. He noticed a miniature sapling inside the egg, which was really delicate and seemed to be naturally formed.Two-thirds of the crystal egg had been exposed while the rest was stuck within the remaining common pyrite. Zhang Tie tried and easily pulled the crystal egg out of the cracked common pyrite. He then was able to see the entire object \u2014 it contained no \u201cyolk\u201d but a sapling instead while the \u201cwhite part of the egg\u201d was flowing with something akin to mercury. Zhang Tie carefully stared at the \u201cmercury\u201d and found that it was a colorful light fog that was exceptionally beautiful. The light fog was swirling about the sapling mysteriously. The faint flash that Zhang Tie noticed came from the colorful light fog.Several blisters had formed on Zhang Tie\u2019s palms after the spear training at noon. Perhaps due to Zhang Tie holding the common pyrite too tightly on his way back home, the blisters on his palms were pricked broken by the edges of the common pyrite. As a result, the common pyrite and the crystal egg were dyed with Zhang Tie\u2019s blood. The crystal egg, being dyed with fresh blood, became not as beautiful. When Zhang Tie tried to clean the blood marks on the egg with his sleeve, he found that a small patch of dark blood could not be cleaned off. Instead, it penetrated into the crystal egg slowly. The blood mark gradually shrunk and became round. It slowly condensed into a drop of fresh blood at the top of the crystal egg. When the fresh blood condensed, the crystal egg began to shine brighter.\u201cArgh\u2026\u201d feeling hot, Zhang Tie naturally loosened his hold on the crystal egg. He was stunned because the crystal egg was steadily suspended in the air in front of the oil lamp with a faint glow. Zhang Tie was frightened and widened his eyes nervously. While he was confused and frightened, the small drop of blood finally came into being at the top of the crystal egg and dropped towards the small sapling in the center of the egg.The moment the drop of blood fell, Zhang Tie felt dazzled; he felt as if he was falling from high altitude. He then saw the glowing crystal egg flying towards him. Almost at the exact same moment, he felt a sharp pain between his eyebrows. It seemed as if something had suddenly drilled into his brain, and as a result, Zhang Tie saw his vision dim and passed out\u2026He totally lost his consciousness then\u2026Zhang Tie finally recovered consciousness after a long time.The first thing he felt was a cold feeling on his face. He was still somewhat frightened and didn\u2019t know what had happened to him. After several seconds of thinking, Zhang Tie opened his eyes and realized his face was completely on the floor.Rolling his eyes, Zhang Tie tried to climb up. Sitting on the bed, he found the lamp was still lit, although it was a little dim. He estimated that three to four hours had already passed. He stood up and pulled away the cold-proof partition on the window. It was pitch black outside, and the barking of dogs reverberated from afar which confirmed Zhang Tie\u2019s judgment that it was currently midnight.Hold on\u2026 Where was the crystal egg?Zhang Tie was startled. He stared at his hands and looked around but found nothing except for the \u201cfool\u2019s gold\u201d in his room. He picked up the half of common pyrite and observed it. The only thing he could see clearly was the smooth and round track in the common pyrite which told Zhang Tie that what had just happened was all true.CouldCouldn\u2019t it be that\u2026it had flown away\u2026When Zhang Tie recalled that the crystal egg was suspended in the air, he checked everywhere in his room, including wall seams, doors, and windows. He found nothing and naturally accepted the above conclusion.He took out a mirror from the drawer at the head of the bed. Besides the slightly pale face, he found no wounds between his eyebrows, thus he blankly sat on the bed for a while until his stomach thundered and reminded him that he had not eaten supper. Zhang Tie suddenly felt an unprecedented hunger and felt like he could eat an entire calfwolfing a calf.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAside from the crystal egg event, the most critical thing for him was to fill his stomach. Otherwise, he would starve to death and the crystal egg would mean nothing to him.Zhang Tie did not dare to make any noise as he carefully lowered the staircase. With an oil lamp in hand, he went down the stairs stealthily and found food in the kitchen. Thankfully, the staple food was boiled sweet potatoes, which were as delicious as when they were freshly boiled. There were seven or eight boiled sweet potatoes in the kitchen. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t think much of it and wolfed them down in the fastest speed he could. Surprisingly, he noticed that his appetite had greatly improved. The sweet potatoes weighed more than 1 kg. Usually, he would only be able to eat half of them at most. What was happening? To his surprise, he only felt half full and thirsty at the same time. He drunk another two gourds of water and three more bowls of cooked rice brew. It was really an unprecedented experience.Under the light of the dim lamp, he simply brushed his teeth and washed his feet before returning to his room. Removing all of his clothes, Zhang Tie laid on his bed as he tossed and turned; he couldn\u2019t fall asleep at all. Finally, he made the decision to cultivate. Assuming the posture, he sat on the bed and evenly adjusted his breath. The moment he closed his eyes and visualized the abacus in his mind according to the book MENTAL ARITHMETIC BY ABACUS, he suddenly found something new in his mind. When Zhang Tie focused on it, he gradually recognized it. He almost cried out as it was exactly the simple yet brilliant arched door on the shell of the egg. The arched door was suspended in his deep consciousness. When Zhang Tie concentrated on it, it expanded quickly and became increasingly clear\u2026It seemed\u2026 seemed as if he could enter it, a hazy voice reminded Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie was also confused about this idea. Zhang Tie gazed at the arched door and said, \u201cEnter!\u201d. The miserable 15-year-old teenager would never have imagined that his life would be different from before at that point forward\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the same time, Zhang Tie also felt warmer. He could smell a much fresher air, a smell akin to the park after it rained. Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but open his eyes. When he did, he was really shocked with his mouth opened widely, saliva dripping.What was presented in front of Zhang Tie was a square, broad, and empty land. Standing in the middle of the piece of land, Zhang Tie noticed that this land was several times larger than the Seventh National Male Middle School. He roughly measured the length and width of the land with his eyes and found that they were both at least 700m. It felt extremely open; there were only a few things left on the land. It seemed like a barren land with only one bulge at the center of the land. There was also a small tree as tall as a person not far away from Zhang Tie.With great curiosity, Zhang Tie looked at the small tree.It was growing well with its spreading branches and luxuriant foliage. Each leaf seemed as if it was flowing with a special brilliance, which made the tree very conspicuous. What amazed Zhang Tie was that the leaves were in various shapes and colors, making each leaf distinct from one another. How weird! However, Zhang Tie also felt strangely harmonious with the leaves of varying shapes hanging on the tree. The tree was neither made of gold nor wood; it was a material that nobody knew of.Colorful fog swirled above the tree in ever changing shapes. Staring at the tree for a while, Zhang Tie naturally felt a sense of tranquility and peace.What he had earlier seen in the crystal egg several hours ago was fully present in front of his eyes \u2014 the strange tree and the colorful fog\u2026\u201cAm I dreaming?\u201dLooking at himself, he was wearing the same clothes he wore before going to bed \u2014 he only wore shorts. Even his posture in bed was unchanged. Zhang Tie pinched his [email\u00a0protected] #$% and realized that he was not dreaming, thus he got up and stood on his bare feet. Where he sat was just ten steps away from the tree. He moved towards it and circled it twice. He didn\u2019t know why, but he felt a sense of familiarity with the tree. He felt that he and the tree shared a blood-tie.Being a relative to a strange tree, Zhang Tie was almost driven mad.Circling it for quite some time, he couldn\u2019t figure it out. He only felt that there was something strange about those colorful leaves. Thus, Zhang Tie decided to further explore the land. As the soil was fine and smooth with a proper temperature and contained no impurities, Zhang Tie felt like he was standing on soft and wet sand, so he began to run in his bare feet. Although the area only covered slightly more than 0.5 km2 and was limited in space, it was still enough for Zhang Tie to make a dash. He explored the surrounding environment and the edge of this space. He could see the rolling colorful fog from far away. There was a strange elasticity that pulled Zhang Tie back from the barrier; therefore, he was never able to break through it. More than 300m away from the small tree, Zhang Tie found a black deep mire that was larger than 200m2. The mire was as black as ink, and it was still bubbling; however, there was no smell, which gave Zhang Tie goosebumps. After looking around, Zhang Tie found no other living being within this space besides himself, not even a single ant.\u201cAnybody here? Where am I?\u201d\u2026\u201cCan anyone tell me where I am?\u201d\u2026\u201cAnybody here?\u201d\u2026Zhang Tie shouted yet got no reply, not even an echo. He spent another ten minutes to look around and finally ascertained that he really was the only living being here.Therefore, Zhang Tie decided to start from the tree.Circling the tree for a while, he felt increasingly intimate with it. Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but touch the small tree that had splendid leaves. Touching it, Zhang Tie abruptly saw a semi-transparent pale blue dialog box that had a line in it and was startled.\u2014\u2014Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree\u2014\u2014The tree feels that energy is leaking from your body. With the leaking energy, you can produce Leakless Fruit. Do you want to produce it?\u2014\u2014Yes \u2026 NoThere were two options below which Zhang Tie had never seen before. He was really stunned when he saw this. Moving his hands away, the dialog box disappeared; putting his hands on it, the dialog box re-appeared. He repeated this for many times and got the same response. Although he didn\u2019t know what it was, he knew that it was definitely a great thing\u2026Although Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know what energy was escaping from his body, he considered that the choice would do him no harm, thus he stretched out his hand and selected \u201cYes\u201d. It was a strange feeling. Although there was nothing in front of Zhang Tie, when he pressed the option, he felt like he really pressed something \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Leakless Fruit in production, 168 hours away from maturation!\u2014\u2014Space management system template of Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree is established!\u2014\u2014Please name It. Attention, the name is permanent!\u2014\u2014Space name:\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \uff08followed by a line of sparkling spots\uff09The moment the old dialog box disappeared, a new one appeared. Seeing the line of sparkling dots behind the name of the space, Zhang Tie was stunned for a while. He then figured it out and replied \u2014 Castle of Black Iron!After That, the four words appeared on the sparkling light spots. This also shocked Zhang Tie.\u2014\u2014Name of space: Castle of Black Iron!\u2014\u2014Enter \u2026 BackZhang Tie pressed the \u201cEnter\u201d button. Then, the old dialog box disappeared and a new one appeared.\u2014\u2014What do you want the system to call you?\u2014\u2014Your Name:\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\uff08followed by a line of sparkling light spots\uff09Zhang Tie then naturally knew what to do next. After a while, he figured that nobody would even know. Even though he was a little arrogant, no matter what, he was not afraid of being called sick; therefore, he set his name \u2014 Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord!\u201cIt should be ok, nobody would know!\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself faintly. Finally, he made a decision and pressed \u201cEnter\u201d\u2026\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron and the Lord of Castle of Black Iron confirmed!\u2014\u2014Preliminary management system template of Castle of Black Iron has been established!When the dialog box disappeared, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes turned bright once again. A semi-transparent pale blue icon, marked with a small tree in the center and \u201cCastle of Black Iron\u201d below the small tree, appeared in the upper left corner of Zhang Tie\u2019s vision and started to sparkle. Becoming braver and braver, Zhang Tie touched the icon with his hand, and as a result, the icon instantly expanded in front of Zhang Tie while several lines of words appeared on the branch of the tree and became a tree-like menu.There were four options inside:\u2014\u2014Basic Attributes of the Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Space and Topographic Creation\u2014\u2014Living Beings and Species Management\u2014\u2014Produce Special Seeds and Fruits of Manjusaka Karma Fruit TreeZhang Tie touched the first item, \u201cBasic Attributes of the Castle of Black Iron\u201d, which was between the root and the branch of the functional tree. All of a sudden, a new data window opened.Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa (a length unit in ancient India)\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura Value: 0\u2014\u2014Merit Value: 0\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage\uff1a0\u2014\u2014Special Output: Void\u201cLength unit 1 Krosa? What\u2019s that? How long does that mean?\u201d Zhang Tie only heard about millimeter, centimeter, decimeter, meter, kilometer, sound second, and light second. However, what\u2019s \u201ckrosa\u201d? \u201cI\u2019ve never heard about that!\u201d Zhang Tie looked at the other basic attributes and heaved a deep sigh.It was completely empty. Although it had poor data, Zhang Tie became vigorous as he felt like starting from scratch. Even though he couldn\u2019t understand the content, he continued to touch another button \u2014 \u201cSpace and Topography Creation\u201d. Unexpectedly, the following words appeared in front of Zhang Tie:\u2014\u2014As the three storage values of Castle of Black Iron are 0, the Space and Topographic Creation Function is not available!Touching another option, \u201cLiving Beings and Species Management\u201d, a new window opened.\u2014\u2014Carbon Based Living Beings and Species Management\u2014\u2014Silicon Based Living Beings and Species Management\u2014\u2014Sulfur Based Living Beings and Species Management\u2014\u2014Other Living Beings and Species ManagementThis time, besides the first option, \u201cCarbon Based Living Beings and Species Management\u201d was available, while the other options were all gray. When Zhang Tie pressed the first button, a dialog box containing two messages jumped out.\u2014\u2014Input systematic resources into a biological population or an organism. You can help this living being mutate and evolve in an unprecedented way.\u2014\u2014The system has detected carbon based microorganisms on you, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord. When you entered the Castle of Black Iron, the Microorganisms System of the Castle of Black Iron started.After the dialog box disappeared automatically, three new options appeared.Among the three sub-options of animals, plants, and microorganisms, only the option \u201cmicroorganisms\u201d was activated and available.Therefore, Zhang Tie touched the option of microorganisms.Zhang Tie then saw the microorganisms that he \u201ccarried\u201d into the Castle of Black Iron under the option of \u201cMicroorganism\u201d. They were bacteria and microzyme. Everybody, more or less, carried bacteria. Some were good, while some were bad. The microzyme might have come from the rice brew at home. He remembered having drunk three bowls of rice brews downstairs just now. Some of the rice brew might have spilled onto his clothes and followed him into the Castle of Black Iron.He touched the option \u201cMicrozyme\u201d, which enlarged and looked like a drop before another new picture appeared.To the left of the icon of \u201cMicrozyme\u201d was a red cross. Under the icon, the system showed three sliders that were similar to schedule bars and respectively corresponded to the three basic attributes: aura value, merit value, and basic energy.As it did not seem that complex, Zhang Tie simply glanced at it and understood their uses. The three sliders seemed to represent that you agree to input systematic resources into these living beings. Once you have decided to do that, the selected living beings or species would mutate and evolve to a certain degree.Zhang Tie touched the other red cross beside the icon \u201cMicrozyme\u201d!\u2014\u2014 Will you, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Owner, kill these living beings using the rules of the space? Attention! Once it has killed, it will never revive.\u2014\u2014Yes\u2026 Cancel\u2026Zhang Tie was startled and hurriedly touched the \u201cCancel\u201d option and decided to use this function as little as possible.It seemed very interesting. Closing this window, Zhang Tie tried again and found the function \u201cProduce Special Seeds and Fruits of Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree\u201d was not available yet.The Castle of Black Iron seemed to be full of secrets. When Zhang Tie was prepared to further study it, a dialog box appeared in front of him:Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014 The system has detected that you, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Owner, is already exhausted, both spiritually and physically. All functions are in negative conditions. As the aura value of the system is zero, it cannot provide a good environment for you to recover. It\u2019s suggested that you, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, leave the Castle of Black Iron and return after you have recovered.Meanwhile, the \u201cdoor\u201d in his consciousness also sent a slight wave to indicate that once Zhang Tie would like to leave, he just had to lock the \u201cdoor\u201d in his mind and think to himself, \u201cReturn\u201d\u2026After that, Zhang Tie felt very sleepy. It was a really energy-consuming day He made a deep yawn, and after thinking for a while, he held back his desire to continue exploring. He locked the door in his mind and thought to himself, \u201cReturn\u201d. He felt that feeling of traversing a tunnel once more. Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes opened widely, as he didn\u2019t know how he was out of there. He only felt that the door in his mind shook, and then he found himself standing on his bed and everything around him had instantly changed. What had happened just now seemed as if it came from nothing. It felt like a photographer pulled a line on the wall behind him to change the background when taking a picture of a family.That was [email\u00a0protected] #$ing amazing!Without recalling what had happened just now, Zhang Tie felt really sleepy and fell asleep instantly\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How wasteful!Hurriedly blowing out the oil lamp, Zhang Tie put on his clothes. He then lowered the staircase and after walking down two steps, he realized something. He returned to his room and threw the remains of the common pyrite into a broken sundry box in the utility room before rushing downstairs.Dad had already left for work by this time, only mom was at home. The porridge was prepared and being warmed by the water in the pot. Hearing Zhang Tie washing his face and brushing his teeth, his mom walked out of the rice brew store and helped Zhang Tie take out the breakfast from the pot. At the same time, she murmured, \u201cDid you go to bed late last night? You should treasure your body!. Oh, I almost forgot. I already washed the underwear you hid in the drawer. Remember to take your underwear downstairs and throw them into the washing basin next time!\u201dZhang Tie was rinsing his mouth, producing a \u201cgulugulu\u201d sound; however, when he heard what his mom had said, he instantly choked on the water. As a result, he coughed for quite a while before he was able to recover his composure. Perhaps due to choking or being irritated, Zhang Tie\u2019s face suddenly turned red. When he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, he shouted, \u201cMom, I\u2019ve told you more than three hundred times that I\u2019ll wash my own clothes. Please don\u2019t enter my room, I\u2019m not a kid anymore!\u201dWhen Zhang Tie woke up yesterday morning, he didn\u2019t have time to wash the pair of underwear that had traces of seminal fluid. Thus, he took it off and hid it in the drawer under the wardrobe. After he came back last night, his full attention was on the mysterious object; therefore, he forgot to wash it. When he recalled that his mom found his 'secret\u201d while she washed his underwear, he felt really shameful and wanted to hide in a hole in the ground.\u201cI know, our Guoguo has grown up. I brought you up, so it\u2019s nothing strange\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s mom said without a care in the world. Zhang Tie realized that what he said just now was useless. He had no choice but to try his best to prevent it in the future. He needed to keep it a secret. Once other people knew about it, he would lose face.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t say anything. He wolfed down the porridge and ran out the door without even cleaning his mouth. He seemed to hear his mom\u2019s murmuring, \u201cDon\u2019t run so fast when you\u2019re full. Walk slowly\u2026\u201dOn the way to school, in order to arrive as soon as possible, Zhang Tie, for the first tme, spent two copper coins to take a trolley traffic vehicle for several stops. However, when he had hurriedly arrived at school, he heard the rings of the school bell that indicated that the second class was over.Miss Daina\u2019s class was over! As this was an even week in May, the first two classes on Friday were taught by Miss Daina, while during the odd weeks, they would be history classes.Zhang Tie instantly became dejected. It was all his fault as he overslept.Rushing to the amphitheater at school, as he expected, he could no longer see Miss Daina anymore. He only saw the undergraduate bachelors pouring out of the door and crowding into the washroom. Usually, when Miss Daina was in the classroom, those bachelors preferred not to leave the classroom to piss during the two hours so that they could keep looking at her attractive figure.\u201cMiss Daina is becoming more and more beautiful!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI met her last night in a dream!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve observed her breasts for two hours, they are bigger yeah!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cThat round and sexy bottom is really mature, I really want to touch them!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cI stood for two hours, it really was torture!\u201dZhang Tie heard all talks about her when a crowd of bachelors passed by him. Nobody cared about what she taught in the biology class at all.At last, the bachelors of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood also walked towards Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie saw them, and they also noticed Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie saw the fatty Barley winking his eyes towards him. Doug was also looking at him nervously, which made Zhang Tie confused.\u201cWhat\u2019s up? Why are you late?\u201dBarley patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder.\u201cErm, I overslept!\u201d Zhang Tie scratched his head coyly.\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026 Don\u2019t be too [email\u00a0protected] #$ing tired. If you consume too much energy, you\u2019ll oversleep!\u201d Hista always showed an obscene smile that was as evil as the acne on his face. Right then, the emphasized word \u201c [email\u00a0protected] #$ing\u201d really made people impressed.\u201cYour face seems pale today, did Hista hit the mark? I\u2019ve experienced the benefits of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, so you must have had a hard time sleeping last night!\u201d Leit gave him a surreptitious wink.\u201cWhat did Miss Daina teach today?\u201d ignoring the two, Zhang Tie turned to Sharwin. Among the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, Sharwin was the only one who paid attention in Miss Daina\u2019s class and was really good at making notes; therefore, he would always be laughed at by others.\u201cSimple treatment with rotten vine and the living habits of man-eating spiders. I can lend you the notes if you want!\u201d\u201cOk, let me have a look!\u201d\u201cHurry up, I can\u2019t stand it anymore!\u201d Bagdad urged. They then rushed into the washroom. However, Doug evidently slowed down. Seeing them leave, Doug silently drew Zhang Tie aside.\u201cLet\u2019s be friends!\u201d these words made Zhang Tie tremble.Noticing Zhang Tie\u2019s expression, Doug realized that his words were not precise enough, \u201cOh, no, I mean let\u2019s be at peace!\u201d\u201cAt peace?\u201d Zhang Tie gazed at Doug, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t tell Bagdad about what happened to me yesterday, then I\u2019ll forgive you about the vomiting thing. You know, I was seen by many people that day, so some guys have already started to call me the Monster Mucilage!\u201d Doug dejectedly twisted his face.Zhang Tie finally knew why Doug was cold to him for the past week. What a narrow-minded guy! \u201cIf anyone dares to call me the \u2018Monster Mucilage\u2019 at school and in front of Miss Daina, I swear I\u2019ll beat them up until even their mothers won\u2019t recognize them\u201d Doug added.\u201cWell, let\u2019s be at peace. I will not tell anyone about what happened yesterday!\u201d Zhang Tie became generous since he didn\u2019t want to give back the money. \u201cBut what will I say if Hista asked about you?\u201d\u201cTell them I entered and did her for three hours! I\u2019ve already talked about this with Barley\u201d\u201cOk, you did her for three hours. Additionally, when you left, she felt reluctant to send you off. She then kissed you and asked you to come visit her next time!\u201d\u201cGood brother!\u201d Doug patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder excitedly as if he had met a bosom friend.Zhang Tie could only succumb to him.The next morning class was the carpenter class. For the next two hours, all the bachelors in Zhang Tie\u2019s class would use the two-man saws to saw the wood in the practice workshop at school. Until the bell rang, they continued to saw wood until even their hands were swollen.The classes in the afternoon were physique training and testing. As usual, Glaze would always attract all the attention. He renewed his records on the deep squats and the maximum continuous armor piercing strikes he made one week ago to 320kg and 123 attacks respectively. Even the instructor thought that Glaze was a natural born fighter.Compared to the glorious Glaze, the achievements of most students in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood were as plain as the airport landing areas before the Catastrophe. Only Bagdad ranked in the top twenties in the 100m dash with a time of 10.8 seconds in the afternoon and became the only shining light in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. As for the other members, take Zhang Tie for example, he had no records at all, as the instructor only recorded the achievements for the top 3 in each 100m dash. However, Zhang Tie\u2019s achievements were always below tenth place. His best achievement was ninth place with a time of 11.6 seconds, while the record for third place of the group was 11.2 seconds. There were even four or five people ahead of Zhang Tie. Evidently, his record was nothing special in the group of undergraduate bachelors. As for the fat Barley, he definitely had one of the worst time among the group of undergraduates with a time of 13.7 seconds, though he was never ashamed of his record.After the physique training class, Zhang Tie got his latest personal data:Zhang Tie100m\u2014\u201411.6sBench press\u2014\u201490kgDeep squat\u2014\u2014170kgExplosive punch\u2014\u2014right punch, 240kg; left punch, 190kgRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLegs\u2019 maximum stamping explosive\u2014\u2014270kgMaximum continual breaking-armor pricks\u2014\u201448 pricksEndurance: 4In the age dominated by fighting force, Zhang Tie\u2019s achievements were as miserable as the 15-year-old youth.

You\u2019re only 15, yet he wants you to make money during the weekends?\u201d Doug foolishly asked.\u201cIt\u2019s understandable. Shawin is the elder since he has two younger brothers. He should fulfill the responsibility of an elder brother.\u201d\u201cYea, what about you, Hista? What are your plans?\u201d\u201cHoho, I have some spare money this month, so I plan to relax myself this weekend!\u201d saying this, Hista kept thrustingraising his waist up.\u201cSon of a [email\u00a0protected] #$%, you saved your spare money for a month, including the money for your breakfast, just for that?\u201d Bagdad said, shooting a contemptuous glare at him.\u201cI will die without doing women! After the first time, I now understand that I am living only for women\u2026\u201d Hista replied seriously. He then started murmuring with Barley with his arm wrapped around Barley\u2019s shoulderIn this fashion on the last day of the school week, the core members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood chatted and joked freely before separating to do their own business.Zhang Tie was running rapidly across the alleys neighboring the school. After running for about two blocks, he finally arrived at where he had always gone to \u2014 the train station at Wesley Avenue. Zhang Tie stood at the mouth of a small alley beside the station, breathing heavily as he gazed at the corner on the other side.For the past two years, he had always waited here on numerous occasions and for the most part, he could see the one he was waiting for. In the past, he would always wait with many other students outside the school gate after school and followed her for almost two blocks. However, ever since the terrifying one-eyed man appeared, whichever horny student decided to follow her would be fiercely beaten by him. As a result, nobody dared to follow her anymore. However, Zhang Tie still stuck to it. Naturally, he didn\u2019t dare to follow her in the usual manner, so he would come here to appreciate her after school each day, even if it was only for a single glance.After Zhang Tie peacefully waited for more than ten minutes, a figure walked out from the corner of the avenue more than 40 meters away from the station. The moment Zhang Tie saw Miss Daina, he felt like he was appreciating a living painting instead of a person in front of him. At the sight of Miss Daina, Zhang Tie felt the whole world become alive, and the 15-year-old teenager felt breathless.Walking towards him from afar, Miss Daina arrived at the station. The shadow that was more than 20 meters away from the mouth of the valley where Zhang Tie hid was the most beautiful. With the most beautiful hair, the most beautiful figure, the most beautiful clothes, the most beautiful legs, and the sexy black high heels, Zhang Tie felt that Miss Daina was the reincarnation of a goddess.Her hair definitely smelt fragrant, just like her body fragrant. Gazing at her beautiful hair, Zhang Tie thought to himself, \u201cWhat would it feel like if I touched it?\u201d The teenager was in the mire of an illusion\u2026On the station platform, there were several passengers waiting for the vehicle and were talking loudly. However, when Miss Daina arrived, Zhang Tie realized that they lowered their voices. Even the two gentlemen who were reading the newspaper on the chairs silently began to sit straight up. A man even turned his head and silently adjusted his hair against the billboard beside the station.Zhang Tie really hoped that the vehicle would never arrive. That way, he could continue to appreciate her. However, only five minutes later, a railed vehicle arrived slowly from afar. All the railed vehicles within the city were just smaller train with narrower rails, smaller heads, lower-powered steam-powered units, slower speed, and less capacity. They were naturally more available in the city.When it was close to the station, the train slowed down, and a wisp of steam rose from the deceleration valve at the end of the coach. With one foot in the doorway, a man showed half of his body while waving a bell. He yelled to remind the passengers to cast their coins for tickets. The passengers then started to board the train.Zhang Tie dejectedly couldn\u2019t recover his composure until Miss Daina boarded and the railed train moved far away. He reluctantly walked home.\u2026As it was the weekend, Zhang Tie\u2019s elder brother, Zhang Yang, would also come back as usual. On each Friday, his family would reunite and eat supper together, thus the supper would be very superb today. His mom had boiled a pot of fresh beans with the remaining half of bacon. Before Zhang Tie entered the house, he could already smell the fragrance of the meat soup. When he saw the steaming oily and milky meat soup tumbling in the pot, Zhang Tie\u2019s appetite instantly rose Taking the spoon against the pot, he scooped up a spoonful of soup. With cheeks puffing out, he heavily blew on it for a while. Although the soup was still hot, he wolfed it down quickly and the taste that could be described as happiness slipped into Zhang Tie\u2019s mouth instantly.\u201cGreedy cattie, you can enjoy a bowl of soup first if you\u2019re hungry!\u201d his mom walked over from the rice brew store and scratched Zhang Tie\u2019s head like what she used to do for the past ten years.Swallowing his saliva, Zhang Tie replied, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not hungry. Let\u2019s wait for dad and elder brother!\u201d\u201cOur Guoguo has grown up!\u201d saying this, his mom tied her apron. \u201cDad is going to work overtime, so he\u2019ll probably be back a bit late. You go take a look at the store, I\u2019ll cook supper!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dHalf an hour later, Zhang Tie\u2019s father returned. After greeting Zhang Tie, he went to the kitchen to help the mom. Twenty minutes later, Zhang Tie was about to sit at the dinner table, and just when he thought his elder brother might not come back tonight, Zhang Yang arrived. Zhang Yang was 1.88m in height and had a strong stature with fairly slim hands. Like Zhang Tie, his eyes and eyebrows were slightly longer and narrower, which gave him a sense of elusive spiritual energy. Wearing the pitch black military uniform of the City Guard Army of Blackhot City, he wore a yellow leather military belt with a copper buckle, had uniformed long sword that hung from his belt, and on his shoulder was a military emblem that signified that he was a sergeant first class. As the little captain of the City Guard Army of Blackhot City, he was almost a military officer.Ever since Zhang Tie was a child, his elder brother has been always his idol.Zhang Yang came back with a knapsack in hand. He opened the knapsack and took out two things and foisted them into Zhang TIe\u2019s hands. \u201cOpen them, it\u2019s enough for a meal!\u201d\u201cCanned beef!\u201d taking the two cans, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes turned bright as saliva began to pour out. Unexpectedly, his elder brother brought back such a good thing\u201cSit here, I\u2019ll open them\u2026 \u201d his mom took the two cans away before Zhang Tie could respond. She put one of them in the cupboards when she went to get another pair of chopsticks for Zhang Yang in the kitchen. She opened only one can of beef. Seeing this, the three men at the table began to laugh. His mom was really shrewd and frugal when it came to their daily lives. All the family members have already gotten used to her.\u201cElder brother, what else is in your knapsack?\u201d Zhang Tie sharply gazed at the filled knapsack. In Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes, his elder brother was like a magician who would always conjure many things.\u201cLook, here you are!\u201d Zhang Yang directly tossed the entire knapsack into Zhang Tie\u2019s hands. Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t wait to open it, and when he did, a pair of black leather training shoes appeared before him. Additionally, there were two dark green sleeveless sweaters, and two pairs of dark green underwear. Leather shoes, sleeveless sweaters, underwear, towel, and soap were all personal living necessitiesutilities given to the City Guard Army in Blackhot City. These goods were in great demand in the black market of Blackhot City. His elder brother had saved them all for Zhang Tie. Looking a the new pair of leather shoes and then at the heavily worn out pair on his elder brother\u2019s feet, Zhang Tie felt like crying.\u201cI\u2019ve replaced them for you, their sizes should be suitable for you. Mom said you had grown up, so don\u2019t cry!\u201d when he said this, he stretched out his huge hand and rubbed Zhang Tie\u2019s hair, making it a mess.Hearing the last few words, Zhang Tie instantly felt that he was losing face. He became coy and irritated all in a moment. At the same time, the elder brother felt it was funny and murmured something to his dad. His dad also laughed out loud, not caring about how embarrassed the young soul was.\u201cMom!\u201d Zhang Tie cried unhappily.\u201cWell, well, supper time, I promise not to disclose it in the future~!\u201d with an opened canned beef on the plate, mom walked over recklessly.The family started eating happily\u2026\u201cDon\u2019t play outside in the evening during this period!\u201d Zhang Yang told Zhang Tie at the table, \u201cBlackhot City is not peaceful recently!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d his dad became a bit nervous. The mom also became alert. Only Zhang Tie was chewing on the beef tendon in his bowl dejectedly. \u201cAny news?\u201d added the dad.\u201cA couple of days ago, Sara, the number two of Bloody Hand Bucher of the Red-scarf Burglars Group, was captured in Andaman City. Yesterday, the alliance parliament voted to hang Sara. The Red-scarf Burglar Group then released news that they\u2019re going to take revenge!\u201d\u201cWill this\u2026 affect Blackhot City?\u201d the dad doubted.\u201cWhen voting if they should hang the Bloody Hand Butcher, 11 of the 17 city-state representatives of the Andaman City-State Alliance agreed, including the representative of Blackhot City. Nobody knew how the voting results were disclosed, but the Red-scarf Burglars Group has targeted the 11 alliance members who voted \u201cyes\u201d for revenge. Blackhot city is remote geographically and at the northernmost end of the alliance, and its surroundings are matched with the weaker alliance forces; therefore, it might be the place that\u2019s the most easily attacked by the Red-scarf Burglar Group!\u201d the elder brother explained peacefully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs the alliance deteriorating? How was the voting result of the alliance parliament leaked? There must be a spy in the alliance. For killers like the Red-scarf Burglars group, some may want to sympathize with them and want them alive\u2026\u201d the dad cursed cynically. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether there are any spies, but vacation for all the guards in the City Guard Army have been canceled for the following two months, so I can\u2019t come back home for the next two months!\u201d said the elder brother with his hands stretched out.\u201cSon, is it dangerous?\u201d the mom worried.\u201cMom, trust me, the Red Scarf Burglars are not strong enough to attack our city yet. Us members of the City Guard Army and the city defense of Blackhot City are sturdy enough. They could at most launch terrorist attacks and destroy in secret. We at the City Guard Army don\u2019t feel too much stress, but you should watch out for yourselves!\u201dOpening his mouth, Zhang Tie wanted to pour out everything about the Castle of Black Iron at this moment. However, he clearly knew that if he told his secret to the family, it might cause an unpredictable catastrophe for the happy family since Zhang Tie, his elder brother, and even his dad and mom were trivial figures in Blackhot City. Zhang Tie had heard many similar stories. He remembered that the trivial figures in those stories had all died miserably. Therefore he decided that keeping it a secret might be the best choice.After supper, his elder brother left, his dad went to black chess with the neighbors, which was his number one hobby, and his mom went to church. Before she left, she closed the door to their home. Zhang Tie was then left alone at home. After collecting and washing the bowls and chopsticks, Zhang Tie returned to his room. It was now the perfect time for him to further study the secrets in the Castle of Black Iron\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_To be honest, Zhang Tie sometimes felt that he was a lunatic. Like now, although he knew there was nobody home, Zhang Tie still checked his room carefully before he would enter the Castle of Black Iron. He then tightly closed the window in his room and the mouth of the staircase. After all, this was a special experience. Zhang Tie himself also didn\u2019t know if there would be any strange sound or light when he entered the Castle of Black Iron. Besides astonishment and surprise, he also felt stressed about having to keep the secret. Hence, it would always be better to deal with it carefully.After checking his room, Zhang Tie felt like he had forgotten something. His mind spun before he patted his head and murmured, \u201cHow could I forget this!?\u201d Zhang Tie lowered the staircase and went downstairs to the courtyard neighboring the kitchen. On a wall of the courtyard hung two strings of dried corncobs. Zhang Tie took one of the corncobs, and after thinking for a while, he entered the kitchen and found two sprouted potatoes from a bag in the corner of the kitchen. He then returned upstairs, back to his room in the attic. Moving to the utility room, he found the two halves of the common pyrite that had been thrown aside. He also found an abandoned steel bar that was longer than a meter. Finally, he found the dagger which was given to him as a present by his elder brother from the drawer at the head of the bed. By either holding onto these articles or by hanging them onto his clothes, Zhang Tie kept his eyes closed in the room and started to touch the arched door in his consciousness.It might have been because he had already experienced the Castle of Black Iron twice, but he was able to touch the door much faster this time. Within approximately twenty seconds after Zhang Tie had closed his eyes and slowed his breathing, the door had already appeared in his mind.\u201cEnter!\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself. He felt the surrounding rays of light slightly sway, and by the time he opened his eyes, he was already in that weird space.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!Once again, a familiar systematic dialog box appeared in front of Zhang Tie and disappeared in several seconds.\u201cHandsome and Magnificent Castle Lord\u201d, \u201cWelcome\u201d. \u201cThose are some really [email\u00a0protected] #$ing good words!\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself pleasantly. He then hurriedly checked his \u201cequipment\u201d.With a steel bar in his right hand, a dagger buckled to his waist, potatoes and corn cobs in his left hand, and two halves of a common pyrite in his pocket, if someone had seen Zhang Tie\u2019s weird appearance, they would definitely mistake him for a lunatic. They would never believe that Zhang Tie was thrilled at this momentZhang Tie sprung up from the ground and yelled with increasing excitement, \u201cGreat! I can actually bring things in.\u201d Suppose he had not discovered the other functionalities of the Castle of Black Iron, this function alone would have already made Zhang Tie thrilled for a long time. This function meant that Zhang Tie could hide things in this secret warehouse and would definitely be useful in the future.\u201cI\u2019m rich, I\u2019m rich\u2026\u201d with his excitement rising, Zhang Tie spun many times on the ground before recovering his composure. Now that the first function of the Castle of Black Iron has been confirmed, it was the right time to look for its other functions. Thinking of this, Zhang Tie let go of the steel bar and potatoes that were held in his hands and pulled out the two pieces of common pyrite and the dagger that was buckled on his waist before throwing it all on the ground. After this, Zhang Tie squatted. Holding onto the dried corncob, he began to peel off the kernels. There were more than two hundred niblets on the corncob, which occupied almost half the space of the pockets on his trousers. After the niblets were removed, he threw away the bald corncob. Zhang Tie then held onto the steel bar, stood up, and began to look around.The space was exactly the same as it was yesterday \u2014 the colorful fog swirled above the space, and the weird small tree and the black mire at the center of the space remained unchanged.After circling the extremely spacious land, Zhang Tie finally selected a place and brutally inserted the sharp end of the steel bar into the mud.Puh, 20cm of the steel bar was fully submerged into the mud.\u201cOh, it\u2019s a little bit deep. I remember that teacher said 10cm was enough,\u201d Zhang Tie scratched his head bashfully and pulled the steel bar out of the mud. Given the quality of the mud, the moisture of the soil under this land was ideal, so Zhang Tie became more confident.Puh, he inserted that end of the steel bar into the soil once more. Its depth this time was almost half of the previous attempt. \u201cIt\u2019s ready,\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself. He then pulled out the steel bar, and a shallow hole appeared in the mud. He pulled out a dried niblet and placed it inside the hole before covering the hole with soil. In this manner, he sowed his first niblet; this was the simplest method to plant corn. Zhang Tie was filled with excitement. After he did it for the first time, the following attempts would be easier. Zhang Tie imitated what he had done the first time: steel bar in, make a hole, niblet in, and cover it with soil with 50 cm distance between the two holes.Puh, a niblet in, bury it\u2026Puh, a niblet in, bury it\u2026Puh, a niblet in, bury it\u2026Puh, a niblet in, bury it\u2026Only after more than 10 minutes did Zhang Tie finally finish sowing all the niblets. He irregularly sowed them in seven or eight rows. After that, Zhang Tie ran back to the pile of articles he had left. He pulled out the dagger and sliced the two sprouted potatoes into five or six pieces. He returned to where he had sown the niblets and dug several pits in a row beside them with the dagger before he buried the potato pieces one by one. After all this work, Zhang Tie patted his dirty hands with satisfaction and smirked for a while. He then inserted the steel bar between the area with the niblets and the area with the potatoes as a marker.The niblets were on the left side of the steel bar, while the potatoes were on the right. Whether or not they would grow up, only God would know.Zhang Tie felt pretty happy when he had finished the second task in the Castle of Black Iron. Sorting through the articles, Zhang Tie walked towards the mire with black bubbles. He had already thought it through and came to the conclusion that everything in this space would be useful, including the black mire.This time, Zhang Tie moved closer to the mire until he was at the edge. Naturally, Zhang Tie was no fool. He didn\u2019t directly touch it, as this place gave him the feeling that it was extremely dangerous and that people should stay far away from it. Zhang Tie knew that if he touched it with his hands, the result would be extremely miserable.After circling the edge of the mire twice, Zhang Tie could still not figure out what it was used for. Finally, his eyes turned bright as an idea came to mind. He needed to verify his idea, thus he went back to the two halves of common pyrite, took them into his hands, and ran back to the mire. About ten meters away from the mire, he waved his hands and threw one of the halves of the common pyrite into the black mire. The moment the common pyrite was cast into the black mire, Zhang Tie hurriedly opened the management panel of the Castle of Black Iron and clicked the Basic Attributes of Castle of Black Iron on the menu:\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura Value: 0\u2014\u2014Merit Value: 1\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage: 0\u2014\u2014Special Output: Void\u201cThe Merit Value has increased to 1. That\u2019s strange, where did it come from?\u201d Zhang Tie was slightly confused. However, all of a sudden, the value of \u201cBasic Energy Storage\u201d changed from 0 to 0.1. At the same time, the font of the option also became brilliant and alive, changing from a gray font to a raised blue font.\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage: 0.1 (blue)The raised item reminded Zhang Tie of the \u201cEnter\u201d button in the system, thus Zhang Tie attempted to press the item \u201cBasic Energy Storage\u201d. As a result, a semi-transparent log window appeared in front of Zhang Tie. There were two tips on the dialog box. The first tip was at the top center of the dialog box and read:\u2014\u2014Everything in the universe is a manifestation of energy. Matter is a form of condensed low-frequency energy, and space is a form of sublime high-frequency energy. Therefore, all matter and space can be reverted to its original energy.\u2014\u2014At 20:38, May 13th, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, a common pyrite was converted by the Pool of Chaos. As a result, the Castle of Black Iron has gained 0.1 unit of basic energy storage!\u201cThe strange black pool is called the Pool of Chaos. It\u2019s somewhat useful; I can throw objects inside and convert them into the most basic energy. Isn\u2019t it similar to the garbage disposal incinerator in Blackhot City? Garbage was burned in the incinerator, while the heat generated from it can be used to provide central heating for the residents in Blackhot City. By contrast, the Pool of Chaos seems much greater!\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s excitement rose when he solved the problem and knew the function of the strange black mire. As for the first tip on the log, Zhang Tie blurrily felt that it was important, but he could not understand it at all. Hence, he ignored it.\u201cEnergy? Matter? Space? What the [email\u00a0protected] #$!\u201d Zhang Tie became irritated as he could not understand it. \u201cIt\u2019s just a [email\u00a0protected] #$ing pool, a garbage treatment plant. What the [email\u00a0protected] #$?\u201dClosing the dialog window, Zhang Tie touched the \u201cMerit Value\u201d option. He clearly remembered the value of \u201cMerit Value\u201d was 0 last time. How could it have become 1 today? Additionally, the font color and state of the two words, \u201cMerit Value\u201d, were evidently the same as that of the \u201cBasic Energy Storage\u201d. He opened it without any hesitation.Similar to the previous dialog window, there were two tips in the dialog that popped out.\u2014\u2014Do good deeds and eliminate evil \u2014 the largest mercy in the Human World;.Worship the gods and love the people \u2014 the nearest stairway to heaven;Lucky people, please show the mercy of the creator to the secular world, so that the Gods can understand you;Please receive the most sincere pleasures and appreciation presented to you by the hundreds of millions of living beings;Please end the evil souls and the endless darkness to become the light, and when you are the light, you are definitely walking on the light and a magnificent road will be prepared for you.The first tip on the log brought Zhang Tie a huge impact. Reading it, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes inadvertently became wet. When he read the second tip, his tears kept flowing down.\u2014\u2014On the evening of May 13, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord ate together with his family members. You took initiative and washed the bowls after supper, cleaned the kitchen, and kept your house clean, which made your parents appreciative. Therefore, you gained 1 Merit Value.It turned out that dad and mom were so easily happy!Although the problem of \u201cAura Value\u201d has not been solved yet, he had already gained a lot. In a complex mood, Zhang Tie left the Castle of Black Iron. All of a sudden, he returned and stood for a period of time before rushing out of his room madly.Three hours later, when Zhang Tie\u2019s dad and mom opened the door, they found that the house was clean, including the floors, walls, table, and chairs, as if they were new. Everywhere was well cleaned, even the places and corners piled with sundries. Being startled, the dad and mom stood there for quite a while.\u201cWhat happened? We were just out for two hours, did we open the wrong door?\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad felt it was strange.Opening her mouth, Zhang Tie\u2019s mom doubted that there was something wrong with her eyes. Right then, lifting a barrel of water in one hand and a map in the other hand, Zhang Tie walked upstairs. At this moment, they understood.\u201cSon, did you do this?\u201d the dad stared at Zhang Tie with a weird look.\u201cYea!\u201d Zhang Tie smiled, wiping the sweat from his forehead.\u201cSon, what\u2019s wrong? Don\u2019t scare me!\u201d the mother stretched out a hand to touch Zhang Tie\u2019s head nervously. Usually, Zhang Tie had never been that enthusiastic and diligent, although he had also taken initiative to help with some housework in the past.Hearing this, Zhang Tie became moved and bashful. \u201cDad, mom, I\u2019m ok. Whatever, I\u2019m free anyway, so here\u2019s a surprise! How about it? Are you happy?\u201dA surprise from their son? Zhang Tie\u2019s dad and mom looked at each other. Heaving a deep sigh, they showed a smile, nodded, and replied, \u201cHappy!\u201d in unison.Zhang Tie also smiled, feeling endlessly satisfied\u2026Lying on the bed, Zhang Tie entered the Castle of Black Iron once again and threw the remaining half of the common pyrite into the Pool of Chaos so as to eliminate the last evidence of the Castle of Black Iron in this world. He opened the Basic Attributes Panel of the Castle of Black Iron:\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura Value: 0\u2014\u2014Merit Value: 2Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage: 0.2\u2014\u2014Special Output: VoidAs expected, \u201c0.1\u201d was added to the Basic Energy Storage. Opening the dialog box of the Merit Value, Zhang Tie saw a new log:On the evening of May 13, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord took the initiative and cleaned his home and made his parents happy. As a reward, you have gained 1 more Merit Value.With a satisfactory smile, Zhang Tie fell asleep\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhang Tie had already begun to help his parents with housework ever since he was a student in preliminary school. His dad worked diligently in the mill, while his mother stayed at home and sold rice brew as a side job. In this manner, they brought up Zhang Yang and Zhang Tie.In the past, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know how to treasure his parents. Two years ago on a weekend when he was home, he found his mom doing housework even after closing the rice brew store. He noticed his mom\u2019s slightly plump and fat back as she mopped the floor. It was completely different from the slim and beautiful figure that he had in his mind from when he was a child. All of a sudden, Zhang Tie felt frustrated and grew up overnight. He started to understand that a man should be responsible for his family and parents. From that day forward, Zhang Tie would stay home every weekend and help his mom with the housework, while other kids played outside. Naturally, Zhang Tie also learned how to make rice brew from his mom. A year ago, the rice brew made by Zhang Tie was already the same as those made by his mom. By then, even the regular customers failed to notice that half of the rice brew was made by Zhang Tie.Oddly enough, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t have any dreams last night and fell asleep very easily. When Zhang Tie opened his eyes at 6:00 am, the sky was still slightly dim. Zhang Tie glanced at the clock and found it was just 6:15 \u2014 a time when young people were reluctant to get up. In Zhang Tie\u2019s memories, he has rarely got up before 7:00 am. Closing his eyes, he planned to have a nap; However, he was unable to fall asleep again. He felt clear-minded and energetic all over and didn\u2019t feel like sleeping at all. He felt as fresh as a white cabbage being scooped from the water after soaking overnight. He usually felt sleepy when he woke up in the morning; however, today, he felt like a polished superb crystal that was free of impurities.After failing to fall asleep, Zhang Tie decided to get up instantly. With only a pair of underwear on, Zhang Tie twisted his bottom as he stood beside his bed. No matter what he did, nobody could see him. He continued to stretch his waist by rotating it sixty circles clockwise and sixty circles counterclockwise, ignoring the obscenity of his actions. He had become used to this habit. His father had told him that men should twist their waists in the morning to strengthen their Yang Qi. Zhang Tie had always kept this in his mind, and later on, he slightly understood it. One day, when he saw his elder brother doing the piston movements with a woman, he understood the function of strengthening one\u2019s Yang Qi. Henceforth, he would slightly practice this series of actions every morning. Although Zhang Tie was still a virgin, for more than ten years, with the exception of his wet dreams, he had not ejaculated once. Men\u2026 hm\u2026 hm\u2026 always wished to be more fierce in that aspect.The moment he began to do that exercise, Zhang Tie lowered his head and noticed a high-raising tent. Removing his underwear, he found his [email\u00a0protected] #$% to be really big. Raising its head with blue veins all over, it was truly terrifying. Zhang Tie tried to bend it, but it was as hard as a stick.\u201cStand for a while. Maybe one day, you will perform well!\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself.After twisting his bottom, he opened the small window in the attic. He lifted his legs and stretched waist several times. Zhang Tie then put on his clothes and lightly stepped downstairs. After cleaning his teeth, he made breakfast for his family. Their breakfast consisted of nothing but porridge. The rice had already puffed well last night and had already turned soft. These grains of white rice were really appetizing.After the rice grains were puffed, Zhang Tie started to make a fire. Blackhot City was rich in coal resources, thus coal was very cheap in Blackhot City. Residents were able to buy a small wheelbarrow full of coal cinder balls made from broken coal cinders with a few dozen copper coins. Although coal cinder balls were cheap, skill was necessary to burn them in the chamber of a stove. Thankfully, after many years of \u201cpractice\u201d, Zhang Tie had already become very familiar with this. In the past, Zhang Tie needed the aid of some pine oil to help ignite it, but he was now able to make fire with the coal cinder balls within ten minutes without the usage of pine oil.Ten minutes later, Zhang Tie made a fire in the chamber of the stove. He washed the pot and began to boil water. With the fierce flames under the pot, the water soon began to boil. He then put the puffed rice into the pot and covered it. Zhang Tie glanced at the fire and smiled. He found it very satisfying to faithfully serve his family and give them a surprise.It would take at least one hour to boil the puffed rice in the pot, thus he had a lot of free time. He walked around the kitchen and thought for a while. Zhang Tie then fetched several big ceramic mugs from the rice brew store, retrieved some water from the well in the backyard, and thoroughly washed them. After he finished washing the mugs, he put them under the eaves of the backyard to dry them. At this moment, day had already broken. After working for almost an hour, Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead was covered in sweat. The moment Zhang Tie had placed the last ceramic mug under the eaves, he found his mom standing at the doorway from the kitchen to the backyard, staring at Zhang Tie in surprise.\u201cGuoguo, what are you doing?\u201d\u201cAh, mom, I got up early, so I wanted to do something with my hands!\u201d\u201cFoolish boy, you\u2019re not grown up yet, you can\u2019t just get up so early!\u201d his mom walked over and wiped the sweat off Zhang Tie. She went and removed the pot lid to check the porridge. Looking at the porridge, she knew when Zhang Tie got up. \u201cGo take a nap. You\u2019ve finished most of the housework this morning. Come down and eat breakfast when you wake up!\u201d\u201cMom, I\u2019m really not sleepy!\u201d Zhang Ti explained languidly.\u201cCome here, tell mom. Have you gotten a girlfriend recently and spent all the money I gave you? I feel like you were strange since last time\u2026\u201d His mom moved closer to him and added, \u201cIf you want money, I\u2019ll give you some. A man should be generous to attract a girl. I have some saved up money, but you can\u2019t tell your dad about it!\u201dStaring at his mom, Zhang Tie was at a loss of words. What!? In the end, his protests were useless and was almost kicked back upstairs by his mom while his ears were pinched. His mom insisted for him to take a nap\u2026\u201cYou are still growing, so you have to sleep more to grow taller!\u201d Seeing his mom\u2019s murmuring shadow, Zhang Tie was moved and went back to his room and pretended to return to sleep.But in reality, he was not able to fall asleep at all. Thinking for a while, he tightly closed the door and the window of his room and entered meditation for the Castle of Black Iron once more. Due to experiencing this a couple of times, he was able to link to the Castle of Black Iron much easier than before. This time, the door appeared naturally in his mind, almost at the moment Zhang Tie closed his eyes and thought about the \u201cCastle of Black Iron\u201d. He said to himself \u201cEnter\u201d and entered the Castle of Black Iron.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!The same dialog box appeared in front of Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes and disappeared instantly. although it was disgusting, Zhang Tie was really happy each time he saw the appellation that he made for himself.Handsome\u2026 Magnificent\u2026 Lord\u2026 Hahahhaha\u2026Raising his chest, Zhang Tie stood still and looked around. Through his naked eyes, he found no change to the land \u2014 a strange small tree, a vast land, plus the steel bar he erected.He then circled the strange small tree, the \u201cManjusaka Karma Fruit Tree\u201d, twice and found no changes which made him lose interest. He decided to check on the seeds he sowed yesterday. When the niblets and potatoes came to mind, his excitement instantly rose. He ran to the marked land and squatted on the ground to observe them carefully.Only a night had passed, nothing had happened to the niblets at all. Zhang Tie was also not that anxious, as he had learned at school that it would take about a week since it was buried in the soil for a niblet to sprout. It was still too early at this point. Thinking of this, Zhang Tie patted his head fiercely and cursed that he had forgotten to water them. This was a really low level error; however, it was still not too late to remember it. He planned to bring in two barrels of water next time. After checking the buried niblets, he moved to the buried potatoes. Surprisingly, some of the stubborn potatoes had already sprouted. He specifically put those sprouted parts upside down yesterday when he buried them. Unexpectedly, some of them should have sprouted this morning. The fresh saplings broke out overnight. Like bean sprouts being soaked in water overnight, they had grown up a lot. The potato with the largest twig had already sprouted out two fresh tender shoots. Marvelous!Zhang Tie was thrilled, \u201c [email\u00a0protected] #$er, with this land alone, I would never have to worry about starving to death even if only potatoes could be planted in it!\u201d Zhang Tie could only make this association at this moment.After a while, Zhang Tie opened the basic attributes panel of the Castle of Black Iron:\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 KrosaRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014Aura Value: 0.3\u2014\u2014Merit Value: 3\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage: 0.2\u2014\u2014Special Output: VoidMerit value rose by 1 as expected. Aura value also rose from 0 to 0.3 which instantly attracted the attention of Zhang Tie\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Fascinated by the \u201cAura Value\u201d option, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t wait to open it. Being similar to the two other options opened yesterday, there was a message at the top of the log about the \u201cAura Value\u201d of the Castle of Black Iron. Compared to \u201cMerit Value\u201d and \u201cBasic Energy Storage\u201d, \u201cAura Value\u201d gave Zhang Tie a better understanding of this world.\u2014\u2014Plants perform as the bridge between matter and living beings. Aura originates from the life energy produced from the combination of plants and matter. It is the basis that all living beings rely on to survive and evolve in which the universe and mother nature can coexist in harmony. The more aura value, the faster the plants will grow. With aura value, other living beings can become more energetic and further evolve.Similar to the logs of the two previous options, the description of aura value shocked Zhang Tie once again. Zhang Tie read it more than ten times repetitively and finally understood why everybody liked the color green. Green was the color of plants, and plants represented the existence of aura, food, water sources, and all other living beings. A greener place meant more plants and more living beings. Try to imagine which would be a better place for humans to survive and reproduce: an unsettled desert or a lush mountain forest. Naturally, the latter option was more proper, as it contained more living resources and aura or life energy.A tiny seed buried in the soil could grow into a towering tree in several years. When you think about it, isn\u2019t that spectacular? It was still a seed without soil; however, it\u2019s a life form that changes greatly in the soil. The change is due to the release of life energy when the two combined. Plants convert matter and energy that could not be directly absorbed and utilized by people and animals into visible food, fresh air, and invisible aura which would nourish all living beings and built a bridge between matter and living beings. As far as Zhang Tie was concerned, the rule of the harmonious coexistence between the universe and mother nature was a benign interaction between matter, plants, and all living beings. Plants could constantly provide aura for all living beings, while the living beings should ensure that the process of aura provision was not destroyed as well as creating proper environments for plants. A teacher once taught him that the reason the human world deteriorated and broke down before the Catastrophe was essentially due to human beings constantly destroying mother nature and violating the rules of the universe. At that time, human beings were extremely arrogant. They treated everything provided by mother nature and the universe as resources and objects that could be willingly plundered and destroyed rather than their homeland and co-inhabitants which they could rely on. Instead of giving gratitude and repayment, people were constantly demanding more and more. As a result, a series of problems occurred. This explained why the orthodox school education system treated the arrival of the Catastrophe and the Star of God as the disaster of human beings, while many extreme sects considered them as the rebirth of human beings. In the eyes of the extreme sects, the Catastrophe and the Star of God represented the end of the wrong behavior of human beings and the beginning of the new behavior for human beings.Finishing reading the first message, Zhang Tie thought for a while before moving his eyes onto the next message that automatically appeared:\u2014\u2014On the evening of May 13, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar (Friday), some potato seeds have begun to sprout in the Castle of Black Iron. The aura in the Castle of Black Iron has been slowly increasing. Attention, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord. The aura in the Castle of Black Iron grows directly proportional to the quantity and the variety of plants within the space. The more high-end plants that could form different levels of life energy required by the Complete Ecological System, the more aura would be provided for the space within the unit time.After reading the second message on \u201cAura Value\u201d, Zhang Tie was very happy, as he had figured out another secret about this mystical space. He learned that several sprouted potatoes could provide 0.3 unit of aura value for the Castle of Black Iron overnight. What about other plants? Take those purple-leaf parasol trees on both sides of the street neighboring his home for example. Although Zhang Tie had not learned too much about the classification of plants, he could still instinctively feel that a tree could provide more aura to the space than several potatoes. As for how much aura would be provided by the tree, Zhang Tie could not answer it for the time being; however, this didn\u2019t matter. Zhang Tie glanced over the spacious space and thought to himself, \u201cWhatever it is, if only it could grow up.\u201d Other unlikely and weird ideas came to Zhang Tie\u2019s mind. As he was in the Castle of Black Iron currently and there were many more secrets to be discovered, Zhang Tie had to put down the unlikely and weird ideas for the time being.Closing the basic attributes of the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie touched another branch on the menu and opened the \u201cSpace and Topographic Creation\u201d option. When he selected this function last time, the system tip stated, \u201cAs each of the three storage values of the Castle of Black Iron is 0, the \u2018Space and Topographic Creation\u2019 function is unavailable!\u201d Zhang Tie really wanted to see what the surprise was when none of the three storage values were 0.When he opened the \u201cSpace and Topographic Creation\u201d option, there was truly a surprise \u2014 a menu of three lower-class items appeared as follows:\u2014\u2014Surface Layer\u2014\u2014Crypt Layer\u2014\u2014Underwater LayerThe options of \u201cCrypt Layer\u201d and \u201cUnderwater Layer\u201d were both gray. According to his experiences, Zhang Tie knew that they were currently not available, thus he pressed the option \u201cSurface Layer\u201d. Once it was opened, a three-dimensional image of about 0.09 m2 appeared in front of Zhang Tie. After careful inspection, Zhang Tie found that this three-dimensional image was a miniature map of the entire space of the Castle of Black Iron. The entire image was so intricate that even the steel bar that Zhang Tie used to mark the ground was displayed. Feeling like the image in front of him should be able to rotate for convenient observation, Zhang Tie attempted to rotate the virtual three-dimensional image. Unexpectedly, it truly rotated along the direction of Zhang Tie\u2019s force and presented the original appearance of the Castle of Black Iron from a different point of view. Zhang Tie\u2019s excitement rose as he continued to rotate the image by 360 degrees and viewed his Castle of Black Iron from all possible angles. Besides the function of rotation, Zhang Tie also found that any part of this three-dimensional image could be enlarged or shrunken. When he moved his two hands to opposite directions on the map in a manner that was akin to drawing open the door curtain, the map would enlarge. Similarly, when he put his two hands on the map and drew them close to one another in a manner that was akin to closing a window, the map would shrink. When he moved one hand towards a direction, the angle of the view on the map also changed. He could observe each detail on the map in a more intricate manner through a casual change of size and view angle.Really interesting! Zhang Tie played with the three-dimensional map as if he was playing with a magic square or a toy. He made drawings in the air to enlarge or shrink the entire three-dimensional map. He kept playing with it for more than ten minutes before he carefully studied other details. Even now, it was named \u201cSpace and Topographic Creation\u201d. It was never just that simple.He found no other functional options on the entire three-dimensional map. The moment he felt curious and wanted to do some \u201ccreation\u201d, a line appeared before his eyes.\u2014\u2014 Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, all creations are in line with the concepts of \u201cVisualized Creation\u201d. Namely, once any topographic image in your mind is cast onto the map, the Castle of Black Iron could create it for you.What the [email\u00a0protected] #$! So easy! Zhang Tie was determined to give it a try. Adjusting the map so that he was directly looking down on it, Zhang Tie gazed at a location on the upper left area of the map and imagined a pond of more than ten square meters. Gradually, a pale blue shadow of more than ten square meters appeared in that region. Although it was blurry, its outline was generally consistent with what he had in mind. Visualization was really energy consuming. With Zhang Tie\u2019s present capabilities, he could not completely imagine all the details of the pond; therefore, the pale blue shadow of the pond was unclear on the map. He was unable to present it clearly no matter how much he concentrated on the pond in his mind. At this moment, another message appeared:\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, the completeness of the details of your created topography is lower than 5%. Do you want the system to use the Optional Nature Creation Law to compensate for the lacking details? After the Nature Creation Law is used to complete the establishment, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord can adjust it manually!\u2014\u2014Yes \u2026 NoNaturally, he chose \u201cYes\u201d. The moment he pressed the \u201cYes\u201d option, the blurry, pale blue pond became clear. As imagined by Zhang Tie, a more natural and life-like pond appeared in the upper left corner of the map. Staring at the virtual scene, Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh. Although somewhat losing face, he had to admit that the system did it better than himself. After the past few days of practicing Mental Arithmetic by Abacus, the only thing he could visualize was an abacus. For his current self, it was difficult to even visualize an abacus, let alone a pond.After the general topographic creation, the alleged \u201cmanual\u201d adjustments became much easier. Namely, the general topographic creation adjusted the 'size\u201d and \u201coutline\u201d of the pale blue virtual scene, and its \u201clocation\u201d on the map was made by making hand gestures as if one were kneading dough. As for other more detailed aspects, he could not create them with his hand. However, the \u201cSpace and Topographic Creation\u201d function was a dozen times more interesting and convenient than Zhang Tie had anticipated. With this function, Zhang Tie saw the entire Castle of Black Iron as a very big, interesting toy \u2014 really [email\u00a0protected] #$ing interesting!Zhang Tie was very thrilled and almost sprang up. However, as he was grinning, a line of words appeared on top of the pale blue pond and instantly shocked Zhang Tie:\u2014\u2014This Topographic Creation Requires the Following Resources:Basic Energy Storage\u2014\u201456879;Aura Value\u2014\u20146878;Merit Value\u2014\u2014912Do you want to create it?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014Yes \u2026 NoCreate crap! Staring at those items and the data behind them on the Basic Attributes column, Zhang Tie almost cried. According to the present schedule, even if he did all the housework, including sweeping the floor and washing clothes, he could only gain 3 merit values a day. It meant that he would have to do housework for at least two years to accumulate 912 points of merit value. As for aura value, he could see a beacon of hope from the sprouted potatoes. It could be easily achieved by planting more on the land. Once the plants were alive, the aura value would grow constantly. However, the basic energy storage made Zhang Tie really desperate. It required 56879 units of basic energy storage. The common pyrite that weighed almost 1 kg could only be traded for 0.2 units of basic energy storage when thrown into the Pool of Chaos. Did it mean that the 56879 units of basic energy storage required at least 140,000 kg (or 280 tons) of common pyrite?Zhang Tie finally realized that he could not afford the huge toy known as \u201cSpace and Topographic Creation\u201d. It seemed that this system complied with the strict law of \u201cequivalent exchange\u201d, implying that without sufficient resources being listed, the system would ignore you. Everything inside this space required the consumption of various materials and large amounts of efforts. No pie dropped from the sky even though the \u201cHandsome and Magnificent Castle Lord\u201d spent efforts for the achievements. That\u2019s why not everybody could afford this huge toy!Zhang Tie had no other choice but to check the other functions to find one that was affordable.He then closed the \u201cSpace and Topographic Creation\u201d option and opened the \u201cLiving Beings and Species Management\u201d option\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Touching the \u201cLiving Beings and Species Management\u201d option, Zhang Tie did not see a dialog box like he did previously. Instead, he saw a miniature icon. He presumed that the dialog box appears only when it was tapped for the first time, which would not have appeared automatically had he not taken the initiative to look it up in the past. What appeared in front of Zhang Tie now was the following lower-level function tree of \u201cLiving Beings and Species Management\u201d:\u2014\u2014Carbon-Based Living Beings and Species Management (Green, Activated)\u2014\u2014Silicon-Based Living Beings and Species Management (Gray, Not Activated)\u2014\u2014Sulphur-Based Living Beings and Species Management (Gray, Not Activated)\u2014\u2014Other Living Beings and Species Management (Gray, Not Activated)Zhang Tie then directly touched the \u201cCarbon-Based Living Beings and Species Management\u201d option, as he found the other items to be difficult to be understood. He remembered that Miss Daina had taught them that carbon-based living beings had already been identified by human beings before the Catastrophe. Cells of the carbon-based living beings definitely contained the carbon element, as they were the basis of the organism. It seemed that all living beings in this world was carbon-based, including plants, microorganisms, and even magical beasts, let alone human beings and animals. As for silicon-based or sulphur-based living beings, Zhang Tie had never heard of them at all. They were totally foreign to Zhang Tie, thus he ignored them.After opening \u201cCarbon-Based Living Beings and Species Management\u201d, Zhang Tie saw the following three sub items again:\u2014\u2014Microorganism Management\u2014\u2014Plant Management\u2014\u2014Animal ManagementThe option \u201cAnimal Management\u201d turned gray, indicating that it was unavailable. Since Zhang Tie tried the \u201cMicroorganism Management\u201d option last time, he touched the \u201cPlant Management\u201d option this time.Then, a message appeared in front of Zhang Tie:\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014On the evening of May 13, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, the system has detected that the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord has entered the Castle of Black Iron with plant seeds; therefore, the Plant Management System of Castle of Black Iron has been activated.The message disappeared two seconds later, and a new window that only contained a three-dimensional icon of a 360-degree rotating potato appeared. Zhang Tie touched it lightly and opened it. He then saw the same scene as the one when he had opened the \u201cMicroorganism Management\u201d option.There was still a red cross beside the potato icon, and there were three sliders that could be moved to the right. The three sliders represented aura value, merit value, and basic energy storage.Looking at the number 3 on the merit value icon for a while, Zhang Tie slid it to the right slightly. As a result, the number 2 appeared precisely on the right of the slider, and the number 3 that appeared under the merit value label turned to 1.Then, Zhang Tie pressed \u201cEnter\u201d.Another message appeared:\u2014\u2014Please choose your target to inject the resource into!Followed by three options:\u2014\u2014The entire population of this species in the space of the Castle of Black Iron!\u2014\u2014The population of this species in specific areas or spaces of the Castle of Black Iron!\u2014\u2014One or multiple individuals of this species in the Castle of Black Iron!Zhang Tie chose the third option, and a three-dimensional map that similar to what he had just seen appeared in front of him. Each potato pit was marked on the map with red sparkling numbers. Zhang Tie touched \u201cNo.1 Pit\u201d on the map, which was the one nearest to the steel bar. The sparkling number of \u201cNo.1 Pit\u201d changed from red to green and no longer sparkled. Zhang Tie then touched the option \u201cEnter\u201d.Due to the limited merit values, he couldn\u2019t be certain of its effects even if he injected it into just a single potato seed, let alone more.\u2014\u2014On May 14, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and magnificent Castle Lord injected two merit value points into a potato seed to stimulate its mutation and evolution.\u2014\u2014Mutation and evolution is expected to be finished in 56 days. Please wait patiently, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord.The two messages appeared for two seconds and disappeared automatically.Zhang Tie also had no way to ascertain whether his input was effective or not. After all, it was only two points of merit value and nothing else, not even aura value or basic energy. It would be a surprise if it was a success, and if he failed, he would just see it as an interesting thing. No matter what, he was still in the process of exploring the Castle of Black Iron.Closing \u201cLiving Beings and Species Management\u201d, Zhang Tie opened the last item, \u201cProduction of Seeds and Fruits of Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree\u201d, on the systematic function tree, which was related to the small tree. Before opening it, Zhang Tie had already instinctively known that the small tree was the core of the Castle of Black Iron. Although the previous options were also great, they were just affiliated attributes when compared with the small tree, just like the green leaves on it.He opened it and the following message appeared:\u2014\u2014Is the universe a friendly place? This is the largest problem that all living beings face and the ultimate pursuit of living beings. From then on, you can loudly answer, yes!The message disappeared in two seconds. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t even comprehend it before an image appeared in front of him. As a result, Zhang Tie\u2019s attention was instantly attracted as he stared at the dense introduction on the image and was stunned.One minute later, Zhang Tie started to drool\u2026Two minutes later, Zhang Tie\u2019s pupil enlarged and sparkled\u2026Three minutes later, Zhang Tie started to sweat all over\u2026Four minutes later, Zhang Tie started to gasp\u2026Five minutes later, Zhang Tie\u2019s face turned red with hands shivering\u2026Six minutes later, Zhang Tie felt breathless\u2026Seven minutes later, Zhang Tie\u2019s heart began to pound\u2026Eight minutes later, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes turned white. He covered his chest with his hands as he fell down on the ground directly with his mouth opened and passed out.Try to imagine a person who kept begging for food in the streets for fifteen years and was always mocked by others. One day, he was suddenly captured by a troop of soldiers and was taken to a place that was as magnificent as a paradise \u2014 a place that he had never seen even in his dreams. Then, a group of tender and sexy beauties with plump breasts would help him take a bath and put luxurious clothing on him. They would provide him with dainties of every kind. After going to the washroom three times, he was taken to a palace and was pushed to the only gold seat in the palace. A multitude of people would begin to kowtow in front of him and called him \u201cYour Majesty\u201d. The beggar must have been scared to death as he asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d. It turned out that the old emperor had died a couple of years ago, and the successive heirs ranked from No.1 to No.800 fought and died for the throne, leaving no survivors. Thus, the imperial bloodline was completely destroyed and the grand emperor lost his legitimate heir. The chancellors were really anxious, so they racked their brains to find a solution. Finally, they found that the old emperor had raped a girl who was selling matches when he was thirsty for sex while he was privately traveling outside the imperial palace. After being pregnant for ten months, the girl gave birth to the kid before passing away. That kid then became an orphan. Naturally, he failed to learn how to sell matches, and neither did he know that his dad was the bastard emperor. However, should he be invited to be an emperor, what would the beggar do?Looking at Zhang Tie, who was twitching and foaming at the mouth, he was that beggar now.Is that true? Zhang Tie asked himself before he passed out\u2026Probably\u2026 maybe\u2026 perhaps\u2026 somewhat\u2026 true! Zhang Tie replied to himself without confidence.He then lost consciousness in darkness and happiness\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPassing out was actually a self-protection mechanism. When a person\u2019s spirit or body reached their limit, this protection mechanism would be activated. As a result, you would be able to face all difficulties. Sad people would become firm and brave, weak people would recover their physique and vitality, while the happy people would become calm.Once you woke up and dared to face it bravely, you would find that it was just so so!Half an hour later, Zhang Tie woke up. Lying on the ground of the Castle of Black Iron, he opened his eyes. Looking at the ever changing color of the clouds that were swirling in the sky of the Castle of Black Iron, he finally calmed down and became rational.He was not a beggar, and there was no throne waiting for him. Zhang Tie was just a 15-year-old commoner in Blackhot City. A miserable teenager who fell in love with Miss Daina secretly and dared not to look her in the eyes. Luckily, he picked up a special common pyrite from the roadside, thus he owned more possibilities later in his life. He really wanted to know which passing-by God or Buddha was happy that day and pointed a bright future for him.Not every fortune could definitely be converted into power nor make your dreams come true. On the road from fortune to power and dreams, you have to work harder, harder, and harder! God only helps those who help themselves! This was the only rule for all commoners in the Age of Black Iron. Besides, all those lucky commoners should bear one tip in mind: before you are able to safeguard this fortune, you should never let others know that you are a lucky man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As his dad had to work on Saturday, Zhang Tie would always spend the day making rice brew with his mom. Their rice brew store could sell five to six mugs of rice brew each week. Although it was a small income, it could still improve the family\u2019s standard of living to a degree.Rice brew was a traditional food for Chinese clan and was easy to make. Its raw material was mainly rice. The processing method was also simple \u2014 First, wash the rice and then put the rice into a pot and boil until it is almost fully cooked. Remove the rice from the pot and dry them. Seal it tightly in clay pots with sugar, honey, and yeast solution to naturally ferment them. In a month, you could open the clay pots and eat it. Well-made rice brew remained fragrant, sweet, and soft and had the glutinous texture of rice. Being rich in nutrition, it tasted sweet and could fill people\u2019s stomach. Besides, it smelt like an intoxicating wine, which made people cool down, decrease the chance of heat stroke, and made the intestines and stomach hydrated. Zhang Tie and Zhang Yang grew up eating their mom\u2019s rice brew.Although the process was simple, each step needed to be meticulously done. The reputation of the Zhang family\u2019s rice brew among the neighboring blocks and frequent customers has been gradually accumulating over the past dozen years.Zhang Tie and his mom made seven jars of rice brew after a day\u2019s work on Saturday. They made the rice brew and moved them into the warehouse behind the courtyard. Then Zhang Tie rode a modified three-wheeler to purchase rice and 2kg of sugar. Whenever they finished making rice brew on the weekends, their rice bag would be almost empty; therefore, each weekend, Zhang Tie would purchase rice at the rice store and 2kg of sugar on his way back. Curiously, Zhang Tie found that the price of rice rose a bit that day from 4 silver and 45 copper coins per 25 kg of rice from last weekend to 4 silver and 58 coins per 25 kg of rice this weekend. It was almost an increase of 3% within one week.Zhang Tie was startled. He was extremely sensitive to the changing prices of living necessities. Zhang Tie remembered that the price of rice in Blackhot City has remained unchanged since he was in middle school three years ago. How could it rise so sharply within a week?\u201cAlas, Zhang Tie, we have no choice either. It rose when we purchased it two days ago. We have to live!\u201d The boss of the rice store started to complain to him, \u201c70 percent of the rice in Blackhot City is brought from outside. Those farming villages and planting areas surrounding Blackhot City can never ensure that there\u2019s enough food to supply the city. We have no solution since the price of rice is determined by the big business groups. Besides rice, the price of wheat flour has also risen in the past couple of days. You can check it out in other stores, some of them even sell rice at a higher price\u2026\u201dAs Zhang Tie had been acquainted with the owner of the rice store for many years, he knew that the diligent and shrewd Chinese boss didn\u2019t tell a lie. Additionally, rice prices in Blackhot City were almost the same in each store with only one to three coppers difference at most for a bag of rice in different stores. If any store sold a bag of rice five copper coins higher than the other stores, it would have no guest.Zhang Tie bought three bags of rice for the price of 4 silver and 58 copper coins each. He loaded the 75 kg of rice onto his small three-wheeler that was a modified secondhand bike with the addition of a bag and a wheel. Besides its ugly look, it could only carry limited loads. Three bags of rice plus the weight of Zhang Tie was already its limit. Before loading the rice bags, Zhang Tie carefully inspected the seams and thread ends on the bags to ensure that there were no traces of leakage or being sewn a second time. He then became reassured. Zhang Tie knew there were some bad rice store owners and grains businessmen that would always lessen the real weight of the grains through the usage of tricks like replacing good-quality grains with bad-quality grains or filling the bag with sand. He came to this conclusion through his years of experience in purchasing rice. As the old saying went, \u201cKids in poor families grew up faster!\u201dAfter purchasing rice, he bought 2kg of sugar at a grocery store that was close to the rice store. He then rode the three-wheeler back home. As expected, after the price of rice rose by 3%, the price of sugar also rose even more sharply. Last week, the price of raw sugar was 91 copper coins per kilogram. This week, it has risen to 1 silver coin per kilogram. It was the same in the surround stores, thus he bought 2kg of sugar and put them in the cloth bag of holding that hung on one handle of the vehicle. He then rode the ugly-looking, modified, second-hand three-wheeler and returned home unsteadily.Returning home, he explained the situation of the rising prices of rice and sugar to his mom and gave the remaining coins back to her. Thinking for a while, the mom gave 10 copper coins to Zhang Tie as spare money. In response to this, Zhang Tie grinned, \u201cThank you, mom! You\u2019re much more generous today. You usually give 5 copper coins at most.\u201dMom heaved a deep sigh and frowned, \u201cNow that the price of both rice and sugar have increased, we have to increase the price of our rice brew since our profit was already thin. If we don\u2019t increase the price, we will not be able to continue our business any longer; however, if we do that, we may lose some of our frequent customers! Alas\u2026\u201dSeeing his mom frowning, Zhang Tie was moved, \u201cMom, trust me. I will let you and dad live well in the future. I have already changed!\u201d\u201cMom knows our small Guoguo has already grown up, totally different now!\u201d smiling, his mom stretched out her hand to touch Zhang Tie\u2019s head.Getting another meaning of the two words \u201cgrown up\u201d, Zhang Tie became bashful again, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you\u2019re expecting mom. I mean, I \u2026\u201d\u201cWell, well. Mom knows our Guoguo has already grown up. You\u2019re an obedient and good kid. Oh! Hurry up and send this rice soup to Grandma Teresa. You won\u2019t be able to arrive there today if you leave too late.\u201dZhang Tie was interrupted by his mom and then loaded the remaining three jars of rice soup onto the ugly pedal tricycle and hurried towards a direction. Being impulsive, he almost poured out the secret of the Castle of Black Iron; therefore, he blamed himself in his mind. If his parents knew of this secret, they would be worried about him. Besides, their family would have to assume unpredictable risks. Riding the tricycle, Zhang Tie made the decision to keep this a secret deep in his heart. He considered that if he was capable enough to keep this secret, he could directly bring benefits to the family, and they would never need to worry about him. He stuck to the idea that the fewer people that knew about this secret, the more beneficial it would be to his family.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs an emerging industrial city, Blackhot City had no deep historical background. At the beginning of its development, convenient urban traffic was one of its focal points. Hence, it had many broad roads, arterial roads, sidewalks, bicycle lanes, and road for vehicles. The road was even clearly divided for the bicycle lane and the normal road for vehicles. Zhang Tie rode the modified, second-hand tricycle on the bicycle lane, ringing the bell. He admired the buses that drove on the road. It was always his dream to own a bus, so as to enjoy a ride around the city with his family members or a beauty like Miss Daina.Steam engines have already been eliminated for almost a hundred years prior to the Catastrophe. It was said that human beings had already invented various advanced machinery equipment and technologies before the Catastrophe, some of which were like myths for Zhang Tie. For example, various aircraft flying in the sky, ships that could still be started without fuel after hundreds of years, vehicles that could carry human beings to the stars, equipment that could easily realize communication between two people more than one million kilometers apart, horrible weapons that could destroy a city, perhaps even a country, when it blew up, and so on. His teachers would always sigh when they mentioned them. As a listener, Zhang Tie was always dazzled by it. Human society before the Catastrophe was really unimaginable. However, after the Catastrophe, human beings lost everything magnificent. Being frustrated, they fetched steam engines from historical washlands and revitalized them from the simplest condensing-type steam vacuum suction pump to the most sophisticated high-pressure steam turbine. They made humans gradually powerful in this age that was utterly different from any age before. As a result, human society developed quickly, much like the minibuses with small delicate two-level steam engines that moved forward and backward in a straight line as it sped through the city.In Blackhot City, commoners used their feet or the urban public traffic system to get to their destination, while some blue collar workers might own a personal bicycle. For instance, Zhang Tie\u2019s family modified such a weird two-hand tricycle for the sake for delivery. However, rich men always owned a bus that was worth more than a thousand gold coins. For those people, a bus was not just a tool used for travel, it was also a symbol of social status and power. So many years have passed, and yet the number of privately owned buses in Blackhot City was no more than a thousand. People who could sit inside these privately owned buses were either rich or nobles. At least in the middle school that Zhang Tie attended, he had not found a single student whose parents or teachers owned such a vehicle. Even Captain Kerlin, the most terrifying one-eyed man, would have to go to work for fifty consecutive years without eating or drinking in order to be able to afford a bus.Almost everything that Zhang Tie had learned at school in regards to machinery and tools was related to various steam engines. As a man born with the desire to be free, the 15-year-old boy possessed two dreams: marrying Miss Daina and owning a beautiful private car. He had always dreamt of driving Miss Daina to a peaceful and beautiful place and making piston movements with her like a moving steam engine. Incidentally, he would also like to check the quake-resistance of the tires and the seats.Immersing in his \u201cwild ambition\u201d, the youth rode the tricycle quickly in the city. Half an hour later, he arrived at Grandma Teresa\u2019s orphanage before 6:00pm\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Standing outside the gate of the orphanage, Zhang Tie noticed the 30m odd city wall and the military buildings within it. The city wall made the people in Blackhot City feel confident and safe. Although people also felt depressed in front of the high city walls, none of them would complain that it was too high. As the city wall could bring enough sense of safety to the people, the prices of all the houses within the walls were soaring.\u201cI wonder if elder brother is standing on the city wall?\u201d staring at the city wall, Zhang Tie thought to himself. As soldiers of the City Guard Army of Blackhot City, they had to defend the city walls. Since Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know the daily arrangements and shifts of the City Guard Army, he naturally had no idea where his elder brother was and what he was doing at the moment. Zhang Tie also didn\u2019t feel like asking for that information. Strictly speaking, all information on the fortifications of the City Guard Army and military actions were classified. When people casually talked, they would always expose something; however, if someone was excessively curious, they might bring numerous troubles and disasters upon themselves, and perhaps even to their family. As a commoner, Zhang Tie was always cautious and was not overtlythat curious. Nevertheless, considering the news of the Red-scarf Burglars, Zhang Tie paid special attention to the top of the city wall. No matter what, he felt that there were more soldiers patrolling on the city wall than usual and the atmosphere was more serious than before.When he recovered his composure, he found Grandma Teresa standing outside the gate of the orphanage. As usual, she would wait here at this moment every week for the arrival of Zhang Tie.As a pious disciple of the Grepis School, Grandma Teresa always wore a green nun\u2019s robe that had some white decorative patterns of olive twigs on it, which symbolized the spirit of the Grepis School. The slightly pudgy grandma in green robes looked very kind, like a neighborhood grandma.Green and white were the favorite colors of Grepis disciples, which also symbolized their religious doctrine. The combination of colors was always kind and delightful.Seeing Zhang Tie riding over, Grandma Teresa smiled and raised her voice, \u201cChildren, your favorite food is coming\u2026\u201dWhen Zhang Tie arrived at the gate of the orphanage, he stopped his tricycle. Five or six nine-year-old children had already run out from the orphanage. In pairs, they started to help Zhang Tie unload the food from the vehicle before Zhang Tie had even asked them for help.\u201cHo\u2026 ho\u2026 be careful. If you can\u2019t do it, I\u2019ll help you!\u201d saying this, Zhang Tie helped them remove the big clay pots from the vehicle. The children hurriedly brought the clay pots into the orphanage happily. Cheers reverberated from the orphanage as more children ran out. The children with a little bit of strength had already rushed out to help them, while the younger ones stood on the roadside. With eyes widely opened and dripping saliva, they heavily sniffed and gazed at the clay pots that contained rice soup inside. For the children growing up in the orphanage, the rice soup that was as white as snow was already exquisite.At this moment, Grandma Teresa would always look at those orphans with a kind smile.Every week, Zhang Tie\u2019s family would always have a lot of rice soup left over when boiling rice to make rice brew. This rice soup was extremely precious; it was something which Zhang Tie and his elder brother couldn\u2019t grow up without. Their neighbors always fetched some rice soup to feed their babies when the mothers had no milk to feed them, or if they couldn\u2019t afford milk.Rice soup tasted good and was highly nutritious. It was the essence of rice. However, it could not be preserved over long periods of time. Basically, it would spoil in two days. His mom said it was a sin to waste food; therefore, she always kept two days of rice soup for their family and gave the rest to others. Some may look down on the bit of rice soup; however, these half-starved orphans might feel like this was the best food they have ever had. The Zhang family delivered the rice soup to the orphanage every week, which could feed the children for two days. As Grandma Teresa always said, this was the best gift from God.At first, it was Zhang Tie\u2019s dad who delivered the rice soup. Later on, it was Zhang Tie\u2019s older brother, Zhang Yang. And now, it was Zhang Tie\u2019s turn. The Zhang family\u2019s business has been based on rice brew for many years. They brought the rice soup here every year, and this had become the tradition of the Zhang Family.Guiding the children to bring in the clay pots containing the rice soup into the orphanage, Grandma Teresa walked towards Zhang Tie and slightly embraced him. She then gave Zhang Tie a slight kiss on his forehead as a blessing,\u201cChild, God will protect every kind-hearted man. People who give kindness to others will definitely be blessed by God, and they will witness miracles in their lives\u2026\u201dGrandma Teresa had said this line many times before, but it sounded different this time. Zhang Tie was slightly moved.\u201cThank you, Grandma. I also trust that God will bless kind-hearted men!\u201dZhang Tie\u2019s face slightly blushed. Grandma Teresa\u2019s body was plump and soft. He felt nothing when being embraced by her before; however, as he had grown up and had known that men and women should not be that intimate, he felt somewhat uneasy. Although he was not that obscene, he felt somewhat embarrassed.After carrying the six clay pots inside, the children took them out after a short while. Each clay pot held more than 10 kg of rice soup. In total, they could hold 60 or 70kg of rice soup. This little bit of rice soup was already considered a \u201cgenerous\u201d gift to the orphanage that was short on food.\u201cOh, I forgot. Grandma Teresa, when I went to the rice store, I found that the prices of many grains have risen!\u201dWhen the children loaded the clean, empty clay pots onto the tricycle, Zhang Tie mentioned that the prices of many grains had already risen. This was not good news for the orphanage.After asking about the details, Grandma Teresa looked somewhat depressed. Looking into the distance, she stayed silent and heaved a deep sigh.Seeing her dejected air and the smiles on the children\u2019s faces, Zhang Tie was moved. He stretched his hand into the trouser pocket and pulled out 10 copper coins \u2014 the 10 copper coins he received from his mom. He placed them into Grandma\u2019s Teresa\u2019s hand as he said, \u201cGrandma, here\u2019s all the money I have. I\u2019ll donate it all to the children. I hope it can help them!\u201dIt was the first time for Zhang Tie to donate to the orphanage. In the past, he was penniless, but now he had some spare money from his mom and felt it was much easier now, as he owned the Castle of Black Iron these days. However, the moment the grandma received the money, Zhang Tie was slightly regretful. He felt that 5 copper coins would have been enough. And now, he was poor again. Nevertheless, he found it too shameful to regret, thus he pretended to be a good boy and grinned bashfully.Being gifted with 10 copper coins, Grandma Teresa blanked out. She then took a deep look at Zhang Tie and touched his head, \u201cGood child, your kindness will be rewarded!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHearing about being \u201crewarded\u201d, Zhang Tie suddenly thought of something. He told Grandma Teresa bashfully, \u201cGrandma, I heard you have many plant seeds. Could you give me some? A classmate of mine moved his home to a new place, which includes a huge courtyard. I\u2019d like to give him some seeds as a present!\u201d\u201cGod, forgive me. I have told a lie to your disciple.\u201d Zhang Tie felt a little bit shameful and blushed. When Grandma Teresa mentioned \u201creward\u201d, Zhang Tie suddenly thought that he might \u201cneed\u201d something. However, she saw Zhang Tie\u2019s uneasy air as the innocence of a \u201ckid\u201d.The Grepis School was also called the School of the Guardian God. The doctrine of which was symbolized by the two colors on their clothes. They used green to safeguard the land and used white to eliminate evil. This school didn\u2019t worship any idol or god. Instead, it worshiped the land that everyone stepped on. The land was called Gaia, the Mother of the Land, by the disciples of the Grepis School. The school believed that all living beings on the land were the descendants of Gaia, the Mother of the Land, and all green things on the land were the gifts and guardians given by Gaia to all living beings.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know whether the Grepis School was accepted in other places, but he knew that the School of the Guardian God was not well accepted in Blackhot City and the Andaman City-States Alliance, which was full of the commercial atmosphere and worshiped gold coins as God. This could be seen from the way the orphanage and Grandma Teresa were treated. In Blackhot City, religions, even with little power, would own magnificent churches or temples, while the School of the Guardian God didn\u2019t have a room for praying besides this orphanage. In the eyes of many people in Blackhot City, this school seemed to be nothing special aside from advocating for people to plant trees each year and adopt orphans. On the second Sunday of each March, the \u201cBlessed Day\u201d of Gaia, the Mother of the Land, the school would always present free plant seeds to the citizens in Blackhot City and collect donations for the school. As a bit of time has passed since the \u201cBlessed Day\u201d this year, Grandma Teresa should have some seeds left over. Thinking of the spacious land and the poor aura value in the Castle of Black Iron that only had several potatoes and some niblets sewn, Zhang Tie felt that he might be able to ask for some seeds from her. Whatever they were, if only they could sprout, they would be able to provide sufficient aura value.Hearing that Zhang Tie wanted some seeds, the grandma showed a big smile. She looked happier than Zhang Tie. \u201cWait a moment, \u201d she said to Zhang Tie. Several minutes later, Grandma Teresa gave a 0.5 kg cloth big that was filled with seeds to him. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t open it. After thanking her, Zhang Tie rode his tricycle and rushed home with rising excitement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On his way back, Zhang Tie\u2019s legs already felt a bit weak. He slowed down, thus it took him longer to arrive home. To put it straightforwardly, Zhang Tie was happy to help others. He was really satisfied at the sight of the innocent smiles on the poor children. Although the rice soup he sent over was not valuable, and some may not even think highly of it, Zhang Tie\u2019s family never thought of it as a great or holy task. In regards to that, it was a waste to just pour it out.Blackhot City owned a rich night life. When dusk fell, some places would become bustling; however, this had nothing to do with Zhang Tie, who whistled and rode back home.By the time Zhang Tie returned home, the rice brew store had already been closed. The gate of their house was also locked up. Zhang Tie opened it and pushed his tricycle into the courtyard. The tricycle was modified by his dad, and although it looked ugly, the wheel added in the back and the basket in the middle were foldable and could be easily taken apart. This way, it would not occupy too much space in the courtyard. Zhang Tie guessed that his dad and mom were at their friend\u2019s place playing cards or at a church, as these were their only hobbies.Parking the vehicle, Zhang Tie washed his hands and took the bag of seeds into the kitchen. Smelling the rich beef aroma, Zhang Tie\u2019s stomach started to make a series of \u201cgulugulu\u201d sounds, while saliva started to flow out of his mouth.The supper was still steaming in the pot. The main dish was braised potatoes with beef.Zhang Tie treasured the remaining can of beef and didn\u2019t want to eat it alone. He preferred to eat it together with mom and dad, like they did at yesterday\u2019s supper. Unexpectedly, his mom braised potatoes with the remaining beef. As a result, the small can of beef became a big bowl of delicacy.Seeing the bowl of \u201cbraised potatoes with beef\u201d and counting the number of slices inside, Zhang Tie knew that his dad and mom didn\u2019t even eat a little bit of the remaining beef from last night. They only drunk a little bit of the soup and ate some potatoes, leaving all the remaining beef for Zhang Tie.Being somewhat moved, Zhang Tie wolfed down the entire bowl of the dish. Even Zhang Tie himself had not noticed that his appetite has been gradually growing recently.After supper, he cleaned the house. He estimated that there were at least two or three hours before dad and mom returned at night. Thinking of the empty land, the niblets, and the potatoes he sowed in the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie quickly took action.Zhang Tie felt that he was somewhat a lunatic. When he returned, although he clearly remembered that he had locked the door from the inside, he persuaded himself to check again. Zhang Tie mocked himself, \u201cCould this be the feeling of a trivial figure who hit the lottery and is always scared that the place where he hid his money would be found by others?\u201d\u201cThen, just be a trivial figure. No matter what, I am a real trivial figure and should not fear being mocked by others.\u201dAfter making the decision, Zhang Tie moved faster and faster. He fetched two metal barrels and ran towards the well. After a while, he filled the two barrels and quickly moved back to the narrow washing room in the backyard.The washing room inside Zhang Tie\u2019s home was only more slightly more than two or three square meters and was usually well cleaned. As the first gift given by his elder brother to his dad and mom after receiving his salary and subsidiary, the bath tub occupied more than half of the washing room. As tall as half a person, the bathtub was not delicate, but very firm. Being painted with lacquer, it was heavy and smooth. Splash. Zhang Tie poured out the two barrels of water into the bath tub. The water level in the wooden barrel was as high as Zhang Tie\u2019s ankle. He took two more barrels of water, rushed into the washing room, and poured them into the bath tub again.It took Zhang Tie about ten minutes of repeating this series of actions eight to nine times before he filled the bathtub. If mom were home, she would definitely have prepared hot water for Zhang Tie to take a bath, but whenever Zhang Tie wanted to take a cold bath like his elder brother, his mother would scold him. However, he was not really planning to take a bath. Zhang Tie put the last two barrels of water beside the bathtub and took the small bag of seeds back to the washing room. As he had just finished supper, the violent movements made Zhang Tie\u2019s stomach and intestines slightly uncomfortable, though he had no time to care about that.Back in the washingroom, Zhang Tie closed the door from the inside. With a small bag of seeds under his right armpit, Zhang Tie lifted the two barrels filled with water and stood steadily. He then took in a deep breath to recover his composure and kept his eyes closed in order to look for the mysterious \u201carched door\u201d\u2026This process seemed much easier. After his attempts in the past couple of days, Zhang Tie found that he could clearly 'see\u201d the \u201carched door\u201d, only if he concentrated his consciousness between his eyebrows and the \u201carched door\u201d that was the gate of the Castle of Black Iron.Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t figure it at all, \u201cWhatever, nobody would spend time on it\u2026\u201dSee\u2014\u2014Lock\u2014\u2014Enter\u2014\u2014Lifting the two barrels of water, Zhang Tie, who held onto the small bag of seeds, disappeared in the narrow washing room.Feeling that everything in his surroundings had changed, Zhang Tie opened his eyes and found himself already in the Castle of Black Iron.He was facing the empty land and the \u201cManjusaka Karma Fruit Tree\u201d in the middle of the land. Naturally, the following line made Zhang Tie\u2019s humble ego expand.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, Welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!Seeing this line, Zhang Tie suddenly felt his spirit rise. His didn\u2019t feel pain in his stomach anymore, and neither did his intestines convulse nor did his legs shiver anymore.\u201cI am the motherfucking lord here\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201d sensing the expanding ego, the miserable youth exclaimed like a horny beast. If he was outside, his noise would definitely have attracted the nearby magistrates. However, in the Castle of Black Iron, he couldn\u2019t even hear any echoes.He had never shouted like this when he was outside in the real world. However, after he released what was buried in his heart, he suddenly felt cool. It was a strange feeling as if he suddenly became more comfortable after that.Then, Zhang Tie decided to yell again\u2026\u201cI am the motherfucking lord of this world\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201dMore comfortable now, one more time\u2026\u201cI want dad and mom to have beef to eat everyday\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201dMore comfortable\u2026\u201cI love you, Miss Daina\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201dOne more time\u2026\u201cI want to be a rich man\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201dOne more time\u2026\u201cAll beauties with plump butts and breasts, your Mr. Perfect is me\u2026 Ahhh\u2026\u201dAfter a space of growl, Zhang Tie felt much better and cool. He didn\u2019t know if anyone else had tried it, but he found it to be a really nice means to release his own tensions.After that, Zhang Tie threw the bag of seeds that was under his armpit onto the land. With the two barrels of water in hand, he moved towards the patch of land where he had sown niblets and potatoes. Although he felt that the soil in the Castle of Black Iron was suitable for growing plants, he was still worried about them if he didn\u2019t water the seeds. It seemed that it doesn\u2019t rain in the Castle of Black Iron, thus Zhang Tie feared that the seeds would go bad without water.Arriving at where he had sown the niblets and potatoes, Zhang Tie put down one barrel on the ground and spread the water from the other barrel onto the niblets that had not sprouted yet. With the water from one of the barrels, he only finished watering less than a quarter of the niblet\u2019s land. He then spread the water of the other barrel, which only covered half of the niblet\u2019s land. He then held the two empty barrels. Keeping his eyes closed, Zhang Tie concentrated his consciousness between his brows\u2026See\u2014\u2014Lock\u2014\u2014Exit\u2026The next moment, Zhang Tie appeared in the narrow washingroom again, even though his feet didn\u2019t move. Turning on the faucet at the bottom of the bathtub, Zhang Tie filled the two wooden barrels and kept his eyes closed.See\u2014\u2014Lock\u2014\u2014Enter\u2014\u2014\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe entered and left the Caste of Black Iron in this matter for five consecutive times. Looking at the two patches of land where he had sown niblets and potatoes, Zhang Tie stood in front of the marked steel bar. Taking in a deep breath, he was very satisfied. However, he suddenly felt his brain ache. It felt like his brain was blank. Previously, he had not noticed it when he was busy watering the seeds. He tried to focus between the eyebrows and saw the marvelous \u201carched door\u201d soon. However, being different from the several instances before, this time, the arched door became very unstable and gloomy. When Zhang Tie seized the door consciously and ordered \u201cExit\u201d, an unexpected event happened.Abruptly, Zhang Tie suddenly felt lightheaded and dizzy, as if he was dropping from high altitude into a bottomless dark tunnel. All of a sudden, he lost his balance and sat on the ground, before passing out. After quite a while, he woke up with a pale face\u2026\u201cWhat happened? How could this happen?\u201d Zhang Tie became frustrated.The sudden following tip provided him with the answer.\u2014\u2014It was detected that you, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, had been excessively spiritually exhausted. It is suggested that for you, the Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, to have a rest inside the Castle of Black Iron before you leave. Caution: Frequent entering and leaving within a short period of time will consume a lot of your spiritual energy. While you lack spiritual energy, please do not frequently enter and leave the Castle of Black Iron, so as to prevent damage to your spiritual energy\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The feeling of his brain suddenly going blank and the feeling of falling into a dark tunnel was really horrific. Moments before, Zhang Tie even thought that he would kick the bucket in this manner. If this was how excessive consumption of spiritual energy felt, Zhang Tie would never try it again.He recovered at this moment and noticed that his body, within a few minutes, was covered with cold sweat. He became weaker. \u201cIt seems that excessive consumption of spiritual energy is serious,\u201d he sharply shook his head and felt that the buzzing sense of being engulfed by darkness in his mind was not fully eliminated yet.There must be something wrong!Although there was some discomfort in his mind, Zhang Tie could still think about some things.He realized that his behavior towards the Castle of Black Iron was really stupid. Obviously, the Castle of Black Iron was immortal. Even now, the increase of 'spiritual energy\u201d required the \u201cpotential life energy\u201d from plants. Zhang Tie had to solve the lack of a water source problem. The Castle of Black Iron would never let the lord of the Castle of Black Iron water the plants here in such a foolish fashion. Even though the soil here was fertilized and didn\u2019t need to be irrigated, what about the \u201cBasic Energy Storage\u201d and the \u201cPool of Chaos\u201d? Didn\u2019t the rubbish disposal plant need something inside to convert matter into basic energy? Would it require Zhang Tie to access the Castle of Black Iron to gain the \u201cBasic Energy Storage\u201d? Did he have to move things inside?When he thought of the huge amount of basic energy storage that needed to be consumed to realize some functions inside the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie became irritated. Motherfucker, it shouldn\u2019t be like that. What a motherf*cking castle lord he was! He was just a porter in the railway station! He had to access the Castle of Black Iron five to six times a day for thirty to fifty years to expand to 666 square meters of land. What the hell!No way! It\u2019s not like this! There must be something wrong or he hadn\u2019t yet discovered some mysterious function in the space. The Castle of Black Iron looked like a very senior system. How could it make such a low level mistake!? It would be like the tycoons in Blackhot City heading for Black Gold Hotel, only to take off their clothes, grow vegetables, prepare coal, and cook food for themselves.Thinking for quite a while, Zhang Tie still couldn\u2019t find the answer. Feeling like he was insulted, Zhang Tie cursed inwardly and decided to leave it alone. \u201cMotherfucker. Whatever, just be a porter! So what? Others are unqualified to even be a porter. It\u2019s more perfect now with the defect. The Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord will be a poor hardworking porter in the future! The Castle of Black Iron is finally perfect now! Is there anything better?\u201dThis was Zhang Tie\u2019s temperament. He was sometimes a lunatic and always became pessimistic when encountering frustration. Sometimes, he was simple and would do that once he made the decision. He would then find numerous reasons to comfort himself and strive to reach his goal. Previously, he regarded Miss Daina as his beloved, but moments later, he felt that a man who had a multitude of concubines is successful. He believed that the love he had never experienced should be great and dreamed about sexy younger sisters, beauties, and mature ladies with sexy figures\u2026Human beings \u2014 perhaps just be a contradictory group.When he left the problem alone, another urgent and unavoidable problem also appeared in front of Zhang Tie. Namely, how does he recover his spiritual energy? How long will it take to recover? If it took too long, and dad and mom found nobody home while the door to the washing room was locked from the inside, and they shouted but got no response, then it would be a big problem. How would he explain it then? Otherwise, what if he abruptly appeared in front of dad and mom who had already returned home?This problem couldn\u2019t be solved by Zhang Tie. Whatever, if this happened, he could tell them a little bit of the truth. The worst case scenario would be beaten by slabs fiercely. However, he had always been beaten by slabs before. Though, they would never beat him to death!Once he thought it through, he felt that it was nothing terrible. Zhang Tie then patted his butt and stood up. He walked a few steps, and then returned. Lifting the two empty barrels, he moved towards the small tree. The small bag of seeds, which Zhang Tie had not opened yet, given by Grandma Teresa still laid there. It was the perfect moment to open it.Moving to one side of the tree, Zhang Tie put down the barrels in hands, squatting on the ground, he picked up that cloth bag of seeds. He undid it and poured all the seeds inside out.Moving to one side of the tree, Zhang Tie put down the barrels that he held in his hands. Squatting on the ground, he picked up the cloth bag of seeds. He undid the bag and poured out all the seeds.It could be said that Grandma Teresa was a caring person. The cloth bag was composed of eight small paper bags, and on each bag was the name of the seed.\u201cHygrophila polysperma\u201d was written on the smallest bag, while the names on the bigger paper bags were: \u201cMorning glory\u201d, \u201cOlive\u201d, \u201cLigustrum obtusifolium\u201d, \u201cPhotinia fraseri\u201d, \u201cHoney pear\u201d, and \u201cRadish\u201d. Seeing the word \u201cradish\u201d, Zhang Tie scratched his head gloomily. He doubted that Grandma Teresa made a mistake. Why would she give me radish? \u201cOlive\u201d was understandable because it was the symbol of the Grepis School. \u201cHoney pear\u201d was edible and could bloom into nice flowers. Why radish? Including \u201colive\u201d and \u201choney pear\u201d, three of the seven seeds were edible. With one more, half of them could be eaten.What does it mean? Zhang Tie scratched his head. Was Grandma Teresa using these 'seeds\u201d to give thanks for the soup given by the Zhang family all these years? It seemed a little bit weird.Seeing the biggest paper bag, that laid on the ground, was filled with something, Zhang Tie ignored the name and directly opened it. Several walnuts rolled towards Zhang TIe\u2019s feet, which made Zhang Tie utterly started. Another edible.What the fuck. Whatever, once they grow, they could provide spiritual energy to this space. Whatever seeds they were, it was better if they were edible! No matter what, he had to sow something in such a huge piece of land; however, he would have to sow the seeds in separate pieces of land. These seeds could also be natural landmarks. When they grew, Zhang Tie might be able to distinguish the four directions in the Castle of Black Iron.With the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree at the center, according to the preset view of Zhang Tie when he opened the map of the Castle of Black Iron, the upper part of the map was north, where he would plant the olive trees. The lower part of the map was south, where he would plant the photinia fraseri. In the west, he would plant honey pears, and in the east, he would plant walnuts. Other seeds like the hygrophila polysperma, morning glory, and ligustrum obtusifolium would be scattered in each direction, which would not be planned. Though, edible vegetables like radish could be planted beside the potatoes and niblets for the sake of collective management.Once he made the decision, Zhang Tie acted on it. First, he opened the bags of hygrophila polysperma, morning glory, and ligustrum obtusifolium, which were easily sown. He gather them together and casually poured them out. Zhang Tie was not good at planting these seeds. Instinctively, he felt that those plants were seen everywhere in the wild. They grew naturally and wildly, thus he didn\u2019t want to waste time on them, treating them as they would in the wild.More than twenty meters away from the small tree, Zhang Tie trotted one circle and spread the seeds casually. In less than three minutes, he had finished sowing the three bags of seeds.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter finishing the first three bags, Zhang Tie became much more serious. He made a row of pits by the steel bar about 50m away from the small tree in the north, then he buried the olive seeds. He did almost the same thing in the south, east, and west. As he found the walnuts to be large, he dug holes that was especially deeper than those of other seeds. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know if this was correct or not. The rest is up to God.As walnuts were very expensive, Zhang Tie had rarely eaten them since he was young. As a result, when he was burying the walnuts, he couldn\u2019t help but eat one. In the end, there were only seven walnuts left.After he finished sowing the walnuts, he ran towards one side of the \u201cvegetables\u201d land and found a piece of land beside the niblets to sow the radish. He inserted the steel bar into the soil and clapped his hands in satisfaction.For Zhang Tie, this was the most he could achieve today. As for whether to water them or not, Zhang Tie planned to make the decision in a month. One month later, if the seeds didn\u2019t sprout by then, he would learn from this experience and water the new seeds.After these tasks, Zhang Tie opened the basic attributes panel of the Castle of Black Iron. With his mouth gaping, Zhang Tie was startled by the huge changes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The peak of the growth of spiritual energy would come when all the seeds sprouted later on. There was no change to the other attributes except for merit value. He remembered that the number of merit value was 3 this morning; therefore, he tried to input two merit value points into the mutation and evolution of potatoes. As a result, only 1 merit value point was left by then. How could it increase by so much within only half a day? To answer this question, Zhang Tie opened the log for merit value.\u2014\u2014On the afternoon of February 14th, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord helped his mom make rice brew, which lessened his mom\u2019s load and made her comfortable. As a result, merit value was increased by 1.\u2014\u2014On the evening of February 14th, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord sent rice soup to the orphanage and donated 10 copper coins. As a result, many people benefitted from you. As a result, merit value has been increased by 32.\u2014\u2014On the evening of February 14th, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, when Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord returned home, he took the initiative to clean his house, wash bowls, and sweep the floor, which made his family members pleased.Seeing the sharp increase in merit value, Zhang Tie thought for a while and moved his eyes to the words to the beginning of the log:\u201cDo good deeds and destroyed evils\u2014\u2014the largest mercy in the human world; worship the gods and love people\u2014\u2014the nearest staircase to the heaven; lucky people, please show the mercy of the creator to the secular world so that those gods could understand you; please receive the most sincere pleasure and thanks presented to you by hundreds of millions of people; please end those evil souls and endless darkness to make yourself a light and when You are a light, you are definitely walking on the light and a magnificent road are paved on your foot!\u201dAlthough he was confused at some parts, reading the paragraph and peering at the sharply increased merit value made Zhang Tie greatly inspired. He now had a deeper understanding of how to gain merit value. Although he was not able to eliminate evil, he could still do something good, whether it was small or big. He could gain merit value points by making others happy, more or less. \u201cHaha, Nice! I love you too much\u2026.\u201dRemembering the numerous \u201cfruits\u201d that grew behind the small tree, Zhang Tie laughed out loudly. If the Castle of Black Iron turned into a woman and appeared in front of him, he would definitely kiss her for a long time\u2026After sowing the seeds, he checked the basic attributes of the Castle of Black Iron. He then ran towards the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree and circled the small tree a few times. Being stunned, he gazed at a twig on the strange tree.He remembered that there was nothing on that twig. However, a light blue grape-sized fruit was now hanging on it. The moment he wanted to touch it with his hand, a line appeared in front of him.\u2014\u2014Leakless fruit is in production and is currently inedible. Once the unripe leakless fruit leaves the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree, it would directly turn to gas and disappear. 124 hours left before it becomes ripe\u2026After reading the line, Zhang Tie instantly pulled back his hand. He recalled that when he found the Castle of Black Iron for the first time, the manjusaka tree asked him to choose whether to use his leaked energy to produce the leakless fruit or not. Is this that leakless fruit?It took 168 hours to produce a leakless fruit, which was a week. This meant that by next Friday, the small fruit would be ripe. At this moment, although couldn\u2019t wait to eat the fruit to test its effects. He also knew that a watched pot would never boil; he had to control his desires. He circled the tree a few times and even touched the various strange leaves before sitting down on the nearby soil. With his hands supporting his jaw, he became absent-minded. After more than an hour\u2019s work, looking at the barren land, he felt that it was really boring, although it was honestly strange at the start. Now, he could only slowly wait until he recovered a little bit of his spiritual energy. In here, it was a nice place to do exercise and run; however, he was truly tired today and didn\u2019t feel like running at all. He didn\u2019t know if dad and mom had returned or not. They should not have returned this early since it was a Saturday and his dad would take a rest on Sunday. If it was like usual, they would come back late.What should he do then? Just sit here and do nothing while waiting for his spiritual energy to recover? Otherwise\u2026 meditate? Zhang Tie burst into laughter at his thoughts. Hahaha\u2026 no kidding, how could a commoner of Blackhot City know how to enter meditation, a senior technique and skill? There might be someone in Blackhot City who knew how to increase spiritual energy through meditation, but it was monopolized by a few people and was something that commoners could never touch. Captain Kerlin said that the minorities who knew how to increase spiritual energy through meditation had various backgrounds. Even Captain Kerlin himself didn\u2019t know about it, let alone others.It would be impossible to light the burning points in the Shrine. Thinking for a while, he suddenly patted his head, \u201cHow could I forget this? I got the book <mental>. No matter what, I have some time to practice it now. Why not test it out now?\u201d</mental>Zhang Tie instantly moved. He quickly recalled the relevant content that he had recited more than ten times over the past few days from <mental>. He could fully understand it. Zhang Tie sat down with his legs crossed and hands naturally on his legs. He kept his eyes slightly closed. After a short while, he recovered his composure. He didn\u2019t know why, but he calmed down faster than before.</mental>After calming down, Zhang Tie started to form an abacus in this mind according to the skills he learned from <mental>. This was the most important step and was the foundation of <mental>. After forming the abacus in his mind, he could make quick mental calculations. If you had to ask for a single line to explain the principle of <mental>, it would be the following: Replace your hands with your consciousness, use the abacus in your mind. That was all.</mental></mental></mental>What made Zhang Tie puzzled was that the book required him to form a golden abacus in his mind. It should be brilliant. However, the reason for it was not mentioned. Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t figure it out and neither did he feel like exploring it. He just felt like it was just the way it was supposed to be.According to <mental>, Zhang Tie should imagine the abacus from outlines to details and from simple to complex. He should firstly imagine a rectangular abacus frame, then a horizontal beam within the frame, and then three vertical beams, which represented the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations within three-digits. When the entire image is stabilized, he started to imagine the upper bead between the first vertical beam and the farthest left frame, then the four lower beads between the first vertical beam and the farthest left frame. After that was the upper beads between the second vertical beam and the first vertical beam. Next was the lower beads between the second vertical beam and the first vertical beam, followed by the upper beads between the third vertical beam and the second bead. And then the lower beads between the third vertical beam and the second vertical beam\u2026</mental>The first time, the moment he imagined the upper beads between the first vertical beam and the farthest left frame, the entire image in his mind broke apart\u2026The second time, the same thing happened\u2026The third time, he finished imagining the first lower bead between the vertical beam and the farthest left frame\u2026The fourth time, he finished the second lower beam between the first vertical beam and the farthest left frame\u2026\u2026\u2026Even Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know how many times he had failed. After another four attempts, the poor abacus with three vertical beams was finally imagined successfully and seemed stable. What\u2019s 125 plus 579? Spinning his brain, he moved the beads to the right places on the abacus in his mind, and it turned into a readable number \u2014 704.What\u2019s 18 multiplied by 39? He recited the formula and moved the beads to the correct places\u2026 702!What\u2019s 987 minus 789? He recited the formula and moved the beads to the correct places\u2026 198!Zhang Tie laughed out loudly. He was happy and tested it a few more times. As a result, he could calculate in his mind on the abacus faster than before. How about 56 multiplied by 29? He recited the formula and moved the beads to the correct places. The golden abacus shook and suddenly disappeared in his mind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Tie opened his eyes. As the last calculation result surpassed the domain between the three vertical beams on the abacus, the image exploded like a steam boiler that couldn\u2019t handle the high pressure.\u201cThe book was really valuable,\u201d Zhang Tie reconfirmed its value. He never thought that he could gain such a treasure.\u201cAlas, what time is now? If dad and mom returned, it would be bad!\u201d abruptly remembering it, Zhang Tie quickly stood up. He made no preparation, and neither confirmed whether his spiritual energy had recovered. With eyes closed, he locked onto the door between his brows with his consciousness and said to himself, \u201cExit\u201d \u2026The next moment, Zhang Tie appeared in the washroom room of his courtyard. Along the light of the oil lamp, he saw that the door of the washroom was still locked. He heaved a deep sigh. If his parents came back and found him not there, and yet the washroom was locked from the inside, they would shout from outside the door. If they got no response, the door would have long been kicked open. He opened the door of the washroom and slid out to look around. It was only 11 pm, the gate of the house was still locked from the inside. Thankfully, they hadn\u2019t returned.Standing in the pitch black courtyard alone, Zhang Tie stared at the stars in the sky. He patted his chest and comforted himself, \u201cI\u2019d better be more careful when I access the Castle of Black Iron. If this happened again, my secret might be found by others. I\u2019d better learn to save my spiritual energy.\u201d Zhang Tie reflected, but then suddenly became still. \u201cHow could my spiritual energy recover so fast?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Look, there\u2019s such nice weather today! Why not take a stroll at the downtown park or at the reservoir in the suburb? There must be many people over there. Since I trained really hard today, I\u2019d rather stay back and watch the store for you today!\u201dAfter lunch, Zhang Tie diligently cleaned the house and then pushed his dad and mom out. His dad worked six days a week in the mill, which meant that he often had poor air quality. His mom was even more miserable. She had to stay in the rice brew store six days a week. Thus, at each weekend, in order to make his dad and mom live a better life, he would always persuade them to take a walk, so as to breathe fresh air outdoors. As for himself, he would help them look after the rice brew store.Seeing their son being obedient and sensible, his dad and mom were naturally happy. However, when they left, his mom still muttered to Zhang Tie, \u201cRemember not to increase the price of the rice brew. When frequent customers come, tell them about the increasing price of rice and grains. Tell them that if the purchasing prices are still that high next week, then we\u2019ll have to increase the price a little bit in response. Since they are frequent customers, don\u2019t make them feel like we\u2019re greedy!\u201d\u201cI know, mom. You\u2019ve mentioned it more than thirty times. I\u2019ve grown up already!\u201d explained Zhang Tie. \u201cI\u2019m already fifteen, you don\u2019t need to tell me like you would a small kid or a slow-witted guy. It really hurts my self-esteem!\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t said it thirty times, five times at most!\u201d His mom pretended to glare at Zhang Tie furiously. At the same time, she also pretended to twist Zhang TIe\u2019s ears. In response, Zhang Tie hurriedly slid backward and grimaced at his mom. He then ran into the brew store and yelled loudly, \u201cZhang family\u2019s fresh rice brew. Fragrant, sweet, and delicious. Men will grow stronger with it, and women will be more beautiful with it. Hey, you passersby, six copper coins for a bowl. More sales, less profit\u2026\u201d\u201cThis kid\u2026\u201d Dad shook his head with a smile.\u2026\u2026Seeing his dad and mom disappearing at the end of the street hand in hand, Zhang Tie touched his fuzzy jaw with one hand. He stared at them for a long time before moving his gaze to their shadows. As his dad and mom have been married for dozens of years, each time they walked outdoors hand in hand, it served as a reminder to Zhang Tie that they were not simply just a couple who had married for many years, but rather a couple of youths who are still passionately in love with each other. This gave Zhang Tie an indescribable feeling.\u201cIs this love?\u201d Zhang Tie wondered. To be honest, he was not experienced enough to have feelings about it; however, seeing how his mom and dad treated each other, he felt a sense of happiness inside.After they left, Zhang Tie sat in the rice brew store boringly. He took a fly whisk to drive away the flies. Since rice brew gave off a sweet scent, it naturally attracted flies, even more so on hot days.. Summer would arrive in a couple of months. When it arrives, the door of the rice brew had to be fitted with a bamboo curtain to prevent the flies from entering. However, the delicate exhibitions on the counter would also be covered by the bamboo curtain. As a result, business in the store would decrease. This happened every year in this manner without exception.It was right in the afternoon when the sun was still hanging in the sky. All the birds were silent as they perched on the parasol trees. After a cold winter, they were finally emerging from their nests, jumping and singing happily as the mottled spots and shadows of the trees were cast onto the streets.A board had been hung outside the door of the rice brew store: \u201cSorry, due to the rising prices of grains and other raw materials, it\u2019s expected that the price of our rice brew will rise\u2026\u201d\u201cLovely dad, if it were Donder, he would definitely have increased the sales price of the rice brew as soon as the price of rice increased,\u201d Zhang Tie admired.After sitting in the rice brew store for half an hour, Zhang Tie sold seven or eight bowls of rice brew. He put the scattered copper coins into a drawer and soaked the empty rice brew bowls and spoons left by the customers into the bowl washing barrel. Watching the rising sun, the hand flicking the whisk became more and more powerless. Zhang Tie felt bored. Surprisingly, as an adolescent, he stayed in here to drive away the flies while other boys his age were playing outside! However, the more bored he was, the more he admired his mom, as she stuck to this for twenty years.People would always do something when they felt bored, Zhang Tie was no exception. At this time, he practiced the Mental Arithmetic by Abacus, which included many states. The lowest state was what Zhang Tie had reached last night. Before he is able to use the abacus within his mind, he had to close his eyes and think quite a while to form the abacus in his mind. In the second state, one didn\u2019t need to close their eyes. Within a few blinks, one could form the abacus in their mind and use it. After all, this was a mental arithmetic skill, which meant it was a practical skill. Naturally, it would be useless if you had to spend hours to form it within the mind with eyes closed.In the third state, in order to reach the essence of Mental Arithmetic by Abacus, one would have to form an imaginary abacus in their mind and be able to get the answer instantly when they saw any mathematical question. At this stage, one should be able to create an abacus with two to eleven vertical beams, or perhaps even more in mind. Finally, one would be able to form several abacuses in their mind simultaneously and would be able to get the answer within a single blink. This was the sublime state of Mental Arithmetic by Abacus. Once one got to this stage, they would be a super human-sized calculator.Zhang Tie actually doubted whether it was possible or not for humans to achieve the sublime state. However, when he remembered the blurry words, \u201cRecommended after-class reading for preliminary school students\u201d, Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh. No comparison, no anger. \u201cWhat are these preliminary school students? They must be really motherf*cking smart.\u201d Finally, Zhang Tie even began to think that this book might really have been fetched from the ruins of the Catastrophe. Since the age before the Catastrophe was lustrous and dazzling, things from the ruins were strange and diverse. Expensive crystals used to practice cultivation in this age were just decorations in that age, a time where many people even looked down on it. What if this strange book was truly an ordinary after-class reading material for preliminary school students?\u201cWhatever, I will practice it and check its effects. It seems that I can recover spiritual energy by practicing in accordance to Mental Arithmetic by Abacus.\u201d Zhang Tie intended to confirm it; however, when he thought of the word \u201cwhatever\u201d, Zhang Tie became absent-minded and the abacus with two vertical beams in his mind instantly collapsed.Naturally, he needed to treat it seriously\u2026He found this really hard to accept.Zhang Tie tried it many times and lowered the time needed to form an abacus with three vertical beams in his mind from ten minutes to approximately five minutes. Unexpectedly, two people suddenly appeared in front of Zhang Tie.Fatty Barley and Doug were on a bicycle. Doug awkwardly rode the bicycle with difficulty but with happiness as sweat covered his entire forehead. Barley was sitting behind the bicycle cunningly. The moment Zhang Tie noticed them, Fatty Barley, who was glancing over the two sides of the street, also found Zhang Tie.\u201cRight here, stop!\u201d Fatty Barley shouted and deftly jumped off the back seat of the bicycle and stood on the ground. Hearing this, Doug, who was riding happily, was frightened and shouted, \u201cArgh, brake, brake, how do I brake? Argh\u2026 help\u2026\u201dBang\u2026\u201cBastard, this is a new bicycle dad bought for me!\u201d Barley screamed bitterly.With his hands on his forehead, Zhang Tie became speechless and closed his eyes\u2026Two minutes later, Barley and Doug, who were gritting their teeth and rubbing their butts, appeared in front of the Zhang Family\u2019s rice brew store. Seeing Doug, who was taking in deep breaths of the aroma of the rice brew and swallowing his saliva, and the obscene smile covering Barley\u2019s face, Zhang Tie cursed inwardly. He took out two sets of bowls and spoons and opened one clay pot. He scooped a bowl of rice brew for each of them using a huge spoon and pushed it in front of them. Their eyebrows instantly danced. Without even a word of courtesy, they held the bowls, wolfed down its contents, and cleaned the bowls with their tongues instantly. \u201cCan you be more disgusting?\u201d Zhang Tie complained. The bowls had to be sterilized with boiling water.Seeing the insinuating smiles over their faces, Zhang Tie instantly collected their bowls and spoons and became serious. \u201cThat was my treat just now. Now, it\u2019s six copper coins a bowl, do you want more?\u201dDoug instantly cast his sight towards Barley. Fatty Barley slapped his waist and put a handsome amount of copper coins onto the desk. \u201cDelicious! Two more bowls!\u201dZhang Tie also felt it was natural to put their money into the drawer and scooped another two bowls of rice brew for them. Soon after, they finished it. Under the fascinated gaze of Doug, Zhang Tie put their bowls and spoons into the water basin. When Doug moved his sight onto Barley, Barley automatically ignored him and started to talk to Zhang Tie.\u201cWell\u2026 well\u2026 what was that? Rice brew?\u201d\u201cYes, rice brew! What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cHeh, heh, home visits are a good tradition of our Hit-Plane Brotherhood!\u201d Barley laughed.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get to the point since time is money\u201d\u201cHave you heard of the Red-scarf Burglars?\u201dHearing the words \u201cRed-scarf Burglars\u201d, Zhang Tie was surprised. \u201cYea, what happened?\u201dBarley looked around before lowering his voice and repeating the news that Zhang Tie had heard from his brother, \u201cI heard about it last night. That\u2019s why I came here to tell all of you today. It\u2019s estimated that only a few people know about this news. Whatever, these days, you have to watch out and stay home at night. Do not go out of the city casually. Those Red-scarf Burglars are all cold-blooded butchers. Isn\u2019t there a proverb in your Chinese clan that a fire on the city gate brings disaster to the fish in the moats? I hope my brothers won\u2019t be those unfortunate fish!\u201d\u201cYou came here today to tell me this?\u201d\u201cOf course, you think Doug and I like to come out to be burned by the sunlight? After warning you, I still have to warn Sharwin and Hista. Well, I won\u2019t disturb your business\u2026\u201dSeeing the fatty\u2019s face, Zhang Tie was slightly moved. \u201cThank you, brother!\u201d\u201cAnother free bowl for us?\u201d Barley smiled obscenely.Zhang Tie stretched out his hands and rubbed his fingers. Everyone knew the meaning.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026 see you. We still have other brothers to warn!\u201d Barley slapped the seat of the bicycle and urged Doug to get on immediately. Doug pushed the bicycle a few steps forward before turning around and looking at Zhang Tie as he murmured, \u201cBarley said\u2026 men should learn how to ride a bike for the sake of girls!\u201d\u201cTrust me, I won\u2019t tell the others about it. You are really good at riding!\u201d Zhang Tie raised his thumb.Doug was satisfied. He nodded and awkwardly got on the bike and took Barley away\u2026It was really unexpected that the news of the Red-scarf Burglars would spread so fast. People in Blackhot City has already become worried about them within two days\u2026\u201cNever mind, I will keep practicing Mental Arithmetic by Abacus earnestly. Is there any relationship between the Red-scarf Burglars and a trivial person like me?\u201d A self-deprecating smile appeared on Zhang Tie\u2019s face.In the evening, Zhang Tie\u2019s dad and mom came home with news. The city defense of Blackhot City has become strict. Identification was required to access Blackhot City in the evening.After supper, Gregory, the magistrate of this area, knocked at the gate of the Zhang family with a barn lantern in hand. He was sending a notice door by door and told them not to keep strangers at home in the evening. Besides that, they should instantly report any suspicious individual. Additionally, from midnight onwards, night meals in Blackhot City were forbidden\u2026Half a day after the fatty left, the news of the Red-scarf Burglars had completely spread throughout Blackhot City. An uneasy atmosphere covered the entire city.However, this had nothing to do with Zhang Tie. After supper, when the magistrate left, Zhang Tie brushed his teeth, washed his feet, and then entered his small room. He then entered the Castle of Black Iron and threw a bag of garbage into the Pool of Chaos. After that, he patted his hands and opened the Basic Attributes Panel of the Castle of Black Iron, staring at the latest attributes of the Castle of Black Iron \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Spiritual Energy: 1.8\u2014\u2014Merit Value: 43\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage: 0.5\u2014\u2014Special Output: Void\u2026\u20265 merit value for watching the rice brew store for dad and mom for one day, 3 merit value for doing housework, 8 merit value in total; 1.1 spiritual energy for sprouting potatoes; 0.3 basic energy storage for a bag of rubbish. That was all I gained today\u2026He took a look at the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu103 hours before the first leakless fruit becomes ripe\u2026Being unable to sleep, Zhang Tie took out the crystal that had been dried under the sunlight for a day. With his legs crossed in the Castle of Black Iron, he started to practice igniting the Shrine burning point. Through a few days of experience in the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie found that he could calm down and easily enter the state to practice cultivation by staring at the colorful mist that swirled in the Castle of Black Iron.He soon entered the state to practice igniting his burning point in the Castle of Black Iron. Even though it was the first time, he took several breaths and the Shrine burning point soon radiated with indigo colored flames.Only by making yourself powerful could you survive in this age. There was no shortcut, except for diligent work \u2014 this was the belief that Zhang Tie held for the past fifteen years.It was the same even in the Castle of Black Iron\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had no dreams and his mind was as clear as a crystal. Brimming with vitality, Zhang Tie felt as fresh as a cabbage that had been soaked in water overnight.When he got out of bed, Zhang Tie peered at the clock. It was currently 6:08 am. He then lowered his head to look at his underwear. His p*nis was erected like a study pillar; however, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t think about it too much. He touched the inside of his underwear and found no glutinous feeling on his underwear or his belly. He did not have a wet dream for the past several days, and he really slept well recently. He remembered that he had a pee in the Castle of Black Iron after he cultivated last night. After that, he fell asleep until now. This situation may occur occasionally before, but now it had occurred for four consecutive days. Therefore, Zhang Tie felt it was strange and would like to know the reason. He thought for a while and recalled that it had occurred ever since the night he entered the Castle of Black Iron for the first time. Even now, the Castle of Black Iron was related, which made Zhang Tie lose interest. For Zhang Tie, besides the soil that allowed potatoes to sprout, everything else in the Castle of Black Iron was incomprehensible.Zhang Tie got up quickly. After brushing his teeth and washing his face, he started to ignite a fire in the kitchen. He then made breakfast for his dad and mom by putting several washed sweet potatoes into the boiling pot. After preparing breakfast for his family, he picked up a washed raw sweet potato and walked out the door. Today, he had left for school one hour earlier than usual.It was slightly dark outside. After wolfing down the raw sweet potato for breakfast, Zhang Tie sped along the old road towards the school. However, he felt that this road was different from before and everything had become interesting. Even the raw sweet potato seemed to be much more delicious than before. At this moment, Zhang Tie became determined to test out the sweet potato on the soil of the Castle of Black Iron. No matter what, it wasn\u2019t complicated to plant them.Mood determines one\u2019s view of the world.When he arrived at school, the sky was completely bright and the school gate had just opened. Although he was not the first to arrive, he was one of the earliest. Looking around, he found almost no other students on the spacious campus.Nobody else was in the teaching building meant for the undergraduates; Zhang Tie was definitely the earliest person among all the undergraduates. After entering the classroom, Zhang Tie silently closed the door like a thief.After the two days of weekend, the floor was still clean, but inevitably, a layer of dust had already fallen on the desks and chairs. Zhang Tie took a dried piece of linen cloth from the window sill and looked around to ensure that nobody else was in the classroom. He then started to mop all the desks and chairs, diligently and bravely.Naturally, they were easily cleaned. First, he wiped the desks and chairs with the cloth, and then he patted the dusty cloth over the window. This was also what each student would do when they entered the classroom.Twenty minutes later, Zhang Tie had cleaned all the desks and chairs. Seeing that some students had already entered the teaching building, Zhang Tie silently slid out of the classroom. He entered the washroom and took a long stroll before he slowly returned to the classroom. When he returned, he found that more than half the students had already arrived. \u201cHere\u2019s a big surprise!\u201d Zhang Tie pleasantly thought to himself.Just as he imagined, the classroom was truly bustling. Everyone was curious as to why all the desks and chairs had been cleaned.\u201cAre you kidding me? Who\u2019s that warm-hearted!?\u201d\u201cHeh, Bighead, come here\u2026\u201d Seeing Zhang Tie enter the classroom, Fatty Barley walked towards him and hung his arm over Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cHave you noticed that something\u2019s different today?\u201d he asked obscenely.\u201cWhat\u2019s different?\u201d Zhang Tie pretended to be calm while laughing inwardly. \u201cPraise me. Come on, praise me. I\u2019m waiting for it.\u201d\u201cA motherf*cking idiot mopped all the desks and chairs in our classroom, ha\u2026 ha\u2026\u201dZhang Tie\u2019s reserved smile suddenly froze. Gritting his teeth, Zhang Tie gazed at the fatty and wanted to beat him until his nose bled once again.\u201cDid you brush your teeth this morning? Your mouth is so smelly!\u201d Zhang Tie pushed Barley away in a stern expression and sat back in his own chair.Barley stayed there, yawned on his palm, and smelled his breath. \u201cNo way, I brush my teeth every day!\u201dHearing the surrounding merciless discussions, Zhang Tie became more gloomy.\u201cArgh, who\u2019s that bored? What a big surprise!\u201d\u201cYea, so foolish. Is he in our classroom?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. You might hurt someone\u2019s innocent soul. Maybe a lower-grade classmate wanted to find an elder brother among us to protect him!\u201d\u201cI guess someone is expressing his love to me!\u201d\u201cThen, how could he mop all the desks and chairs!?\u201d\u201cIs he secretly falling in love with all of us? Hahahaha\u2026!\u201d\u201cSh*t, watch out for your ass, guys\u2026\u201d\u201cYou sons of b*tches, who cares about you if not for merit value.\u201d Zhang Tie continued to grit his teeth. He made a decision that if the merit value increased by no more than 2, he would never do such a stupid thing again. These sons of b*tches!This was just a small matter. When the first class of the day began, they had already forgotten about it. The first two classes on Monday morning were survival classes. It contained a lot of things and the teachers always changed. In each class, the teacher would teach them about a topic concerning survival. One day, a teacher taught them how to seduce girls for two hours. He explained that it was an essential skill for posterities and was the most important class for survival. As a result, the horny students became eager to test it out for a whole week.The survival class was their favorite class since the class atmosphere was relatively relaxed. Rather than being taught, it was more about talking to their seniors about their survival experiences. Therefore, it was the most popular class. Under their anticipation, the teacher appeared.Seeing the most terrifying one-eyed man in Blackhot City, the carefree atmosphere in the class suddenly froze. Everybody sat straight up and dared not to suck in even a single breath of air. Captain Kerlin\u2019s aura was powerful enough to crack down all the bustling students.The one-eyed man stood at the podium peacefully as his sharp eyes glanced over each face. He was silent for half a minute.Zhang Tie was curious about his intentions and was also moved by this atmosphere. His heart started pounding.The classroom became so quiet that even the sound of an ant crawling on a piece of paper could be heard. Captain Kerlin then opened his mouth.\u201cYou have heard about the Red-scarf Burglars, so I will not repeat it again. I will teach you the most important survival skill today; it\u2019s related to the Red-scarf Burglars. Suppose you met a Red-scarf Burglar outside the school gate and the guy was as strong as me, what would you do? Don\u2019t tell me so quickly, I will give you two minutes to consider your answer. I will award you if you are right and I will punish you if you are wrong. You can discuss amongst yourselves\u2026\u201dThe moment Captain Kerlin finished talking, the whole class became lively as they discussed fiercely. What would you do if a Red-scarf Burglar was standing in front of you? Looking at the heroic and powerful stature of Captain Kerlin and his seemingly anticipating look, the horny students became thrilled. What could we do facing such an infamous scumbag? The only answer was naturally\u2026\u201cKill him of course!\u201d\u201cYea, surge forward to kill him!\u201d\u201cKill him for the ordinary people!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSurge forward to kill him!\u201dThe horny students exclaimed. Some of them were still hesitant, while other speculators also became lively when they saw Captain Kerlin smiling with the corner of his mouth after their blood-boiling \u201cdeclaration\u201d. Fatty Barley was that kind of speculator. Zhang Tie was also observing the reaction of others. At first, only Doug and Bagdad from the Hit-Plane Brotherhood were shouting to kill the Red-scarf Burglar. At that moment, Barley lowered his head, narrowed his eyes, and looked at Captain Kerlin\u2019s facial expression, while the other members were still thinking. Seeing the others excited, Sharwin was also influenced, and seeing Barley yelling, he also followed. At the beginning, Leit and Hista were somewhat hesitant, but after they noticed Barley\u2019s reaction, they also joined in. As a result, the classroom became chaotic.Zhang Tie was also thinking about Captain Kerlin\u2019s question. Compared to the thrilled fellows, Zhang Tie had two questions: Why did the brave and powerful Captain Kerlin ask such a question in the survival class? What would he do if he actually encountered a Red-scarf Burglar in the classroom at this moment?Some followed the masses to make their decisions, while Zhang Tie always asked his heart since he was young. This was something his mom had taught him. His mom once said that life is a series of choices under different situations. Those choices determine your life, and life is the path towards your heart.No matter what others thought, he would always ask his inner heart when facing questions. His heart was innocent, and he felt he had nothing to regret.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Some people asked the sky, some asked the land, some asked luck, some asked the situation, some asked others, and Zhang Tie asked his inner heart!\u201cWhen you have nothing to regret, you will live a happy life!\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself and an answer came to mind slowly and clearly.The classroom was bustling. The smile on Captain Kerlin\u2019s face gradually became prominent. When he stretched out his hand, the entire classroom suddenly regained its peace. Everybody stared at the one-eyed person and wondered what he would say.\u201cWell, now that you\u2019ve already made your decisions, everybody stand up!\u201dAfter a period of bustling, everybody stood up from their chairs.\u201cThose who want to fight the Red-scarf Burglars, come to my left\u2026\u201dMost of the horny students crowded to the left. Standing, Zhang Tie had made his own decision. A few people stood still; Zhang Tie was somewhat surprised when he noticed that as fatty Barley intended to move his legs to the left, his face suddenly turned pale, and he moved back. Doug and Bagdad had already ran to the left side, and Leit and Hista moved too fast. By the time fatty Barley moved his legs, they had already run to the left side. Finally, they gaped when they found out the fatty was not with them. Sharwin, the pious follower of Barley, also stood still. As a result, only the three members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood who were standing still and another student didn\u2019t move to the left. Under such a situation, even the people who had their own decisions would simply follow the majority.Seeing Zhang Tie not on the left side, Barley was also slightly surprised. He gazed at Zhang Tie\u2019s facial expression as if there was a flower on Zhang Tie\u2019s face.\u201cWell, have you made your decisions?\u201dEverybody nodded while those who stood to the left of Captain Kerlin casted a contemptuous glare towards the four individuals.Captain Kerlin didn\u2019t look at those on the left; instead, he looked at the four who stood still. He casually pointed at Sharwin and said, \u201cTell me, why not surge forward?\u201dSharwin was very nervous at this moment; sweat even began to cover his body when he saw the one-eyed man pointing at him with his wooden club-sized finger. Under the majestic glare of the one-eyed person, he swallowed his saliva a couple of times and weakly pointed at fatty Barley, \u201c He didn\u2019t go over there\u2026 I followed him!\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Captain Kerlin slightly shook his head and pointed at fatty Barley with his wooden club-sized finger. Fatty Barley instantly made a smile like a chrysanthemum. He almost bowed, \u201cIf I saw a Red-scarf Burglar, I would firstly report to the magistrate or Captain Kerlin instead of surging forward!\u201dThe moment Captain Kerlin saw that expression of flattery, he felt uncomfortable and moved his finger instantly towards another person, \u201cWhat about you?\u201dThat guy hesitated for a while before saying, \u201cIf they could solve the problem of the Red-scarf Burglar, then it\u2019s not necessary for me to be there. If they couldn\u2019t, I would be useless as well!\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if you saw a Red-scarf Burglar, you would prepare to escape!\u201d Captain Kerlin emphasized the word \u201cEscape\u201d and turned stern. He made others feel pressured.Under Captain Kerlin\u2019s forced question, that guy felt like he was accepting the strictest accusation. He couldn\u2019t stand it any longer, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026.\u201d He was very brave for mentioning escape in front of Captain Kerlin. The boy was not sure if Captain Kerlin would jump from the ground and slap him directly into the wall when he heard the word. Everybody knew that a tough guy like Captain Kerlin hated cowards the most.Seeing his silence, a sort of unnoticed disappointment slightly appeared in Captain Kerlin\u2019s eyes. He then moved his finger to the last one who was still standing there, \u201cWhat about you? Do you also plan to escape?\u201d\u201cYea, I would!\u201d Zhang Tie answered without any hesitation.Instantly, contemptuous whispers drifted from the left side.\u201cWhy? They are all surging forward, so why do you turn your back and escape?\u201d Captain Kerlin forced him with a sharp glare, \u201c Don\u2019t you want to kill the murderers to protect people like them? To put it straightforwardly, the head of any Red-scarf Burglar is very valuable!\u201d\u201cThey are just going to their deaths. Based on their force, even if they had another group with the same size, they would still be easily killed off by any member of the Red-scarf Burglars within moments. I heard that even the most ordinary Red-scarf Burglar is a LV 5 soldier, and if they surged forward against this LV 5 Red-scarf Burglar, they wouldn\u2019t even be cannon fodder!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about, you timid bastard!\u201d someone on the left side had already begun to verbally abuse him.\u201cYea, don\u2019t try to find an excuse for your cowardice, you timid bastard. So what if we fought to the death? It would still be much better than escaping and being a coward like you!\u201d\u201cPah\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Captain Kerlin turned around and shouted; the whole classroom became quiet. Captain Kerlin looked at Zhang Tie in the eyes and asked another direct question, \u201cAre you saying you\u2019re afraid of death? Don\u2019t you find it shameful to escape? Aren\u2019t you afraid of being called a coward?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s shameful to run from an enemy who is much stronger than myself because I know I have no chance to win and would lose my life! Neither am I a coward! If possible, I would take more people to escape with me\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie dauntlessly stared at Captain Kerlin, whose eyes became more and more stern. \u201cThey are the ones who are shameful\u201d Zhang Tie pointed at people on the left. As a result, those people became irritated as they rubbed their hands and prepared to fiercely beat Zhang Tie.Zhang Tie suddenly became enraged and started to shout at those people, \u201cShut up, you sons of [email\u00a0protected] #$%. You rush forward to end your lives, never considering your parents\u2019 and other family members\u2019 feelings. Your enemy could turn you into a corpse with the flicker of his hand. It takes your parents dozens of years to bring you up. You feel cool that you\u2019re sacrificing yourselves meaninglessly in the bravest and greatest manner you can think of, yet you leave long lasting pains for your parents and other family members. Do you know how much pain parents feel when they lose their son? Do you know how sad they would be when they hear of your death? Have you ever seen your parents cry? You guys don\u2019t know anything\u2026\u201d Those on the left turned silent. They began to consider what Zhang Tie had said as he continued to curse them, \u201cYou big muscles and [email\u00a0protected] #$ing bastards, you\u2019re the most shameful ones, and you\u2019re also idiots. If I were a Red-scarf Burglar, I would also love to kill opponents like you. They could kill you as easy as slaughtering pigs. In front of machetes, even pigs would escape wildly, while you sent yourselves there to your death. You are the most adorable opponents! I\u2019d escape; however, as long as I\u2019m alive, I could continue to give them trouble and divide them. If they were careless enough, I would use other methods to kill them. I can use fire to attract them to dangerous places and poison them to death.I will grow up to give them more troubles. Perhaps even one day, when I am more powerful than them, I would kill them. The day I kill them, the grass on your tombs could already feed cows, you idiots who not even as smart as pigs!\u201d\u201cDamn you, bastards. I got up earlier to clean your chairs and desks, and you cursed me and called me an idiot. Now, it\u2019s my turn to curse back, otherwise I would be dejected. I am cursing you on the behalf of your parents.\u201d Zhang Tie felt so cool inside\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter a while, the whole classroom was silent. The only sound that could be heard was Zhang Tie taking deep breaths.\u201cDid someone from your family members sacrifice themselves before when they served the army?\u201d Captain Kerlin suddenly questioned Zhang Tie after a long silence. Zhang Tie gaped.He never thought that Captain Kerlin was that sensitive. In an instant, Zhang Tie recalled many memories. Finally, Zhang Tie lowered his head, \u201cI had two elder brothers before, but now I only have one. That bastard turned himself into a cremation urn and a medal of bravery on the second year he joined the army during the participation of the war between the Andaman Alliance and Scots. He was brave and always surged forward in each battle.\u201dAs he had lost an elder brother, he knew how painful it was to lose a family member. And his parents hoped him to be as firm as steel that could never be broken by naming him Zhang Tie(TL: Tie means iron in Chinese). This topic was forbidden in Zhang family. Zhang Tie had never seen his late elder brother. He only saw how his mom and dad would silently cry with a photo in their hands. This sadness was deeply rooted in Zhang Tie\u2019s heart. Later on, Zhang Tie knew that he had a bastard eldest brother named Zhang Yong(TL: Yong means braveness). He was so excellent that he was promoted to first lieutenant on the second year he served the army.Zhang Tie and Zhang Yang(TL: Yang means happiness) once swore to never turn themselves into a medal of bravery in their lives. Thus, Zhang Tie considered it to be reasonable to escape from a powerful enemy, and If necessary, he would even surrender. He had never thought of being the great hero who saved the world. His objective in life was to make his mom and dad happy, to make those who are close to him happy, and to make those whom he liked happy. As for the Red or Green-scarf Burglars, he didn\u2019t care about them at all\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was a special feeling floating in everyone\u2019s heart. They were somewhat moved by Zhang Tie. As a classmate and an alleged brother to them, he was the very person who jumped out to scold them when they were doing foolish things! It turned out that everybody mistook him for a coward. Nevertheless, the air in the classroom when he abused them was really annoying and made them feel like beating him.Captain Kerlin was still silent; however, something special filled his eyes.\u201cI saw you last week in the woods, I remember your name was\u2026 \u201d Captain Kerlin scratched his head, gradually remembering something,\u201cZhang Tie!\u201d\u201cI remember now, it\u2019s you. Your words are very right. I was a bastard before that was more foolish than a pig!\u201d after a deep look at Zhang Tie, Captain Kerlin turned and took in a deep breath.Towards those horny students to his left, he suddenly roared towards at them, which consequently made the whole teaching building tremble, \u201cYou, the bastards who are even more foolish than pigs! Do you know why you are wrong? Go run twenty rounds around the training ground and keep shouting \u2018I\u2019m more foolish than a pig\u2019 before the bell rings. In this class, what I want you to remember is that sometimes ruthlessness doesn\u2019t mean bravery, and escape does not equate cowardice. When you face the enemy on the battlefield, you have two tasks: to survive; to make your enemy uncomfortable until they ultimately die. Whatever you do, you have to complete one of the two above tasks to be considered a qualified fighter, otherwise you were born just to be buried underground\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026They finished the rest of the class in the training ground. The group of horny students ran around the Training ground and shouted, \u201cI am more foolish than a pig\u201d, \u201cI am more foolish than a pig\u201d, \u201cI am more foolish than a pig\u201d. As their voices were super loud, even the other teachers and students were attracted as they watched the group during intervals between classes.Captain Kerlin dispatched the fatty Barley, Sharwin, and the other student to the training ground to monitor the running guys. Then he called Zhang Tie to see him.\u201cHeh\u2026 Heh\u2026 What you did in the woods really impressed me. It\u2019s rare to see a student who can take such a beating like you!\u201dIn response to Captain Kerlin\u2019s words, Zhang Tie forced a smile. He knew that the excuse he gave didn\u2019t escape the experienced one-eyed man. He was sensitive despite being tough. Since it wasn\u2019t a serious problem, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t want him to punish the others, \u201cThat\u2026 was just a game\u2026 We were playing a game and we are good friends, so we didn\u2019t treat each other too fiercely!\u201dSeeing Captain Kerlin touching his mustache, Zhang Tie felt something was wrong. From the experience exchanged from blood and tears by numerous predecessors in the school, when Captain Kerlin pretended to think in front of an individual as he stroked his mustache and spoke like a leader, that individual might get some bad luck.When Captain Kerlin pretended to think in front of someone by touching his mustache and spoke like a leader, someone might go bad luck.\u201cHaha\u2026Don\u2019t be that reserved, Zhang Tie. I have seen your miserable attitude. Energetic, very energetic. Young men should be very energetic, that\u2019s how it should be\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t do that anymore, I won\u2019t!\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s heart began to race. He couldn\u2019t figure out how Captain Kerlin would punish him.\u201cI now see you differently because of your escape theory. You can not only take a beating, but also know how to protect yourself when confronted with danger. This is a rare quality, heh, heh, and you are a rare talent!\u201d\u201cYou must be joking, Captain Kerlin!\u201d Zhang Tie began to sweat.Another experienced learned in the Seventh Male Middle School was that when Captain Kerlin started to touch his mustache as he praised someone like a leader, the other person would definitely get bad luck. \u201cCaptain Kerlin, no more joking\u2026 I will go watch them run in case they slack off!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ve got a special reward for you!\u201d\u201cArgh, no, Captain Kerlin, how could I receive your reward!\u201d\u201cErm\u2026erm\u2026 You have to. Are you doubting my, Captain Kerlin\u2019s, promise?\u201d saying this, Captain Kerlin had already placed his two fan-like palms onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders. Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t move at all. An expression of 100 percent sincerity appeared in front of Zhang Tie, \u201cI will introduce you a part-time practice. It\u2019s very good, and you will be highly paid. Besides, you can also strengthen your body and get to know more rich and powerful figures. This is a chance to broaden your vision. If you can do well, you will be much stronger and more powerful. Additionally, there is a handful of beauties over there. This means that you have a chance to get to know some beautiful girls. Many people have begged me for this job, but I didn\u2019t agree. I think that you are the perfect person for this job!\u201dZhang Tie gasped, \u201cThe experience of the predecessors didn\u2019t come true? There is truly such a marvelous thing in the world! Otherwise, was it because of luck? I have been very lucky in the past few days, and a series of good things have happened to me. Could such a perfect job actually fall into my hands?\u201dZhang Tie was just slightly moved and then considered whether Captain Kerlin was telling the truth. Before he was able to nod, Captain Kerlin\u2019s hands had already patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders and seemed like he couldn\u2019t wait to foist the paper into Zhang Tie\u2019s pocket, \u201cSo you\u2019ve agreed, great. Here is my letter of introduction. After school today, you can go to No.18 Bright Avenue to report. Once you present this letter of introduction to him, someone will make arrangements for you\u201dBright Avenue? Is it that Bright Avenue? Hearing this, Zhang Tie began to trust in Captain Kerlin\u2019s words. Bright Avenue was the prime location in Blackhot City and had the highest price for land. It was where all the rich people congregated. Any commodity shown in the windows of the stores were worth at least a year\u2019s worth of salary for an ordinary person. It was the essence of Blackhot City. Owning a personal apartment in Bright Avenue was a symbol of status.Could it be that he misheard Captain Kerlin\u2019s words? The words \u201c Bright Avenue\u201d made Zhang Tie dazzled. He instinctively clasped the letter of introduction, looked at Captain Kerlin, and seriously said, \u201cThank you\u201dCaptain Kerlin was a good person, Zhang Tie teemed with praise towards Captain Kerlin.\u201cErm\u2026 you\u2019re welcome. Don\u2019t try to live up to my expectations, just do your job well!\u201d Captain Kerlin\u2019s face blushed slightly and laughed as he left\u2026\u201c I am more foolish than a pig.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201c I am more foolish than a pig.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201c I am more foolish than a pig.\u201d\u2026\u2026Looking at those guys who were running and shouting in the playground, Zhang Tie was filled with a sense of excellence. He took out the letter of introduction and knocked it with a finger. He was fully anticipating what would happen after school \u2014 I will soon go to the Bright Avenue and try to become familiar with the upper classes. \u201cEnvy me, you bastards\u2026!\u201d Zhang Tie muttered to himself.At lunch, Captain Kerlin honored his promise and added a meat dish for the four individuals. Gazing at the alluring red-braised meat in their plates, Doug and Bagdad were so aspired that they even had saliva flowing down the side of their mouths. Doug stretched out his spoon towards Barley\u2019s plate; however, Barley fiercely pierced his hand with his fork. As a result, Doug screamed and didn\u2019t dare to try anything like that again.Bagdad was a bit self-reserved. He closed his eyes while he ate his potatoes, muttering to himself, \u201cThis is red-braised meat, this is red-braised meat\u2026\u201d which really made him lose face.In contrast, Hista and Leit sat on both sides of Sharwin. They aimed at those pieces of alluring meat in Sharwin\u2019s plate and spoke with a kind expression, \u201cSharwin\u2026\u201dAfter that, they found that Sharwin had directly spit out the half-chewed red-braised meat along with a lot saliva onto the plate full of red-braised meat and mixed it with the other pieces. When Sharwin saw Hista and Leit twisting their faces, he winked and innocently asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s up? Oh, well, would you like some red-braised meat? Come on, it\u2019s delicious! We\u2019re good brothers, so please try some\u2026\u201d Sharwin pretended to give the half-digested red-braised meat to Hista and Leit which scared them off instantly. However, seconds later, the two bastards started to bet with the red-braised pieces of meat on Sharwin\u2019s dining plate. The wager was if one of them dared to eat one piece of the meat, the other would have to pay one silver coin. They continued quarreling\u2026\u201cOh, I almost forgot. This morning, I saw that one of your feet had already moved towards the left, so why didn\u2019t you move to the left then?\u201d Zhang Tie asked Barley while chewing a piece of red-braised meat happily.Being silent for a while, the fatty explained, \u201cWhen I wanted to move, I glanced at Captain Kerlin\u2019s eyes. All of a sudden, I found the same smile on his face as when he had caught me climbing the school wall two years ago. I was instantly frightened\u2026\u201dBeing captured by Captain Kerlin while climbing over the school wall? Zhang Tie silently prayed for the fatty. He didn\u2019t continue to ask how Captain Kerlin had dealt with him because he could imagine that that event was definitely a dark memory for the fatty during his stay at the Seventh Male Middle School. However, after this event, Zhang Tie really praised Barley\u2019s ability to recognize people\u2019s facial expressions. Zhang Tie could never master that advanced skill\u2026Glancing over those naive bastards in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, Zhang Tie found they were all talented!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOh, I almost forgot. I saw Captain Kerlin giving you something privately!\u201d fatty asked absent-mindedly. At the same time, all the bastards of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood raised their ears.Zhang Tie slapped the fatty\u2019s shoulders so hard that the fatty even gritted his teeth and almost spat out the piece of meat from his mouth, \u201cThis guy\u2026 Just ask straightforwardly! See, this a letter of introduction. Captain Kerlin said he had found a part-time job at the No.18 Bright Avenue for me\u2026\u201dKneading his shoulders, Fatty forced an obscene smile. At the same time, Bagdad, who kept muttering red-braised meat, had a strange look and almost choked on the potato in his mouth when he heard \u201cNo.18 in Bright Avenue\u201d.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t notice the change on Bagdad\u2019s face. Instead, he was still thrilled with a full sense of vanity, \u201cCaptain Kerlin said that this reward was especially for me and it didn\u2019t fit others. He was deeply impressed by me in the woods. He said that I would be highly paid and could meet many rich and big figures. I could strengthen my body and be more powerful over there. Additionally, I will have a chance to touch beauties! Alas, I actually didn\u2019t want to be there, but he forced me. You know, I am a soft-hearted man. After his long-time persuasion, I finally agreed with him. I have done too many good deeds, and as a result, even beauties and high compensation would fall to me. Moreover, I can even strengthen my body there. Although I won\u2019t be thinking about the beauties, but what if some of them wanted to be [email\u00a0protected] #$ed by me? Would I agree or not? What a happy boring thing! It really tests my self-restraint. However, I am not a self-reserved guy. Heh, heh, don\u2019t go, I\u2019m not done yet\u2026 \u201dFinally, Zhang Tie saw a row of middle fingers raised towards him\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Waiting until the passenger train disappeared from his sight, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t leave the alley nor did he run towards Bright Avenue.Although he could only saw her in secret, Zhang Tie felt time elapsed. If it was possible, Zhang Tie wanted to see off Miss Daina\u2019s shadow like this for the rest of his life. However, when Miss Daina finally left, Zhang Tie found his stomach growling.In the past couple of days, Zhang Tie found himself to be easily hungry. Previously, he could still stand his hunger after school; however, his stomach had already been growling by this time. Feeling frustrated, Zhang Tie muttered to himself and patted his deflated belly, \u201cYou had already eaten red-braised meat at noon!\u201dRecalling the red-braised meat, Zhang Tie naturally remembered the part-time job introduced by Captain Kerlin. There were passenger trains heading for Bright Avenue in the railway station ahead, but the cost of the ticket was four copper coins, a price that he was reluctant to pay. Therefore, he decided against taking the passenger train. As he sped up while walking, he comforted himself. \u201cI am a young man and I am energetic, so I should do some running!\u201dThis was not the first time for Zhang Tie to be here in Bright Avenue. Despite this, each and every place in Bright Avenue made Zhang Tie feel self-abased and out of place.On both sides of Bright Avenue sat numerous stores that showcased various commodities. Just now when he had passed by a shoe store, Zhang Tie could not help but stare at the pair of shoes which were showcased within the store. The price on the tag was an amount that almost frightened Zhang Tie to death\u201416 gold coins! For the god\u2019s sake! That was the amount his parents would earn after a whole year of hard work. 16 gold coins, 1600 silver coins, 160,000 copper coins. This was enough to buy almost 7 tons of grains. Thinking for quite a while, Zhang Tie still couldn\u2019t think through trading 7 tons of grains for a pair of leather shoes. Although Zhang Tie knew that this was how rich people lived, this really challenged his capability to withstand these stimulations.After seeing that tag price, Zhang Tie became immune to all the other articles displayed in the stores on both sides of Bright Avenue. The more he saw, the more bored he felt towards them. Gradually, he felt self-abased. Hence, standing on the Bright Avenue, Zhang Tie pretended to look straight ahead and ignored the brilliant articles displayed in the stores.Nice cars parked on both sides of the street and uniformed drivers who accompanied them as they cleaned them diligently. Zhang Tie swallowed saliva and continued to look straight ahead, pretending to see nothing\u2026Various tempting aromas drifted from the high-end restaurants situated on both sides of Bright Avenue. Zhang Tie swallowed saliva and continued looking straight ahead, pretending to see nothing\u2026A row of high and slim sexy beauties were standing outside the doors of the clubs. Their skirts opened from their ankles all the way to their buttocks. At the sight of this alluring scene, Zhang Tie swallowed saliva and continued looking straight ahead, pretending to see nothing\u2026Outside the gates of the hotels on both sides of Bright Avenue were doormen and servants who wore white gloves as they diligently and sincerely served the customers that entered and exited the hotels. Staring at the beautiful angel sculptures outside the gates of the hotels, Zhang Tie swallowed saliva and continued looking straight ahead, pretending to see nothing\u2026When handsome boys and beauties passed by him, he noticed their exquisite clothes. Then, he looked at his own old-fashioned school uniform. Zhang Tie swallowed saliva and and continued looking straight ahead, pretending to see nothing\u2026Gentlemen and ladies were muttering and joking in the coffee houses on both sides of Bright Avenue. Glancing at the tag prices outside the coffee houses, Zhang Tie swallowed saliva and continued looking straight ahead, pretending to see nothing\u2026At this moment, in the eyes of the servants who stood outside the gates of the numerous shops and hotels on Bright Avenue, Zhang Tie was just a country hick and a person of low value from the rural areas. Nobody paid attention to him.Wandering on the Bright Avenue like a ghost for half an hour. Zhang Tie had finally arrived at No.18 Bright Avenue. No.16 was in front of him, while No.20 was behind. Seeing the wrought, copper \u201cNo.18 Bright Avenue\u201d sign that hung on the pillar and the staircase of at least ten steps beneath it, Zhang Tie instantly gasped. What was more impressive than the house number to Zhang Tie was the large words on the gate at the end of the staircase \u2014 Iron Thorns Fighting Club.Fighting Club? Fighting Club\u2026 Fighting Club!It was a part-time job in the martial club. All of a sudden, Zhang Tie almost dropped down tears. He was really mistaken about Captain Kerlin. He was really a good good person!In this age, fighting force was of the utmost importance, and fighting clubs were the best place to improve one\u2019s fighting force \u2014 at least in the Blackhot City.Taking a deep breath, Zhang Tie raised his chest high. He then touched that letter of introduction in one of his pocket and strode towards the gate of the Iron Thorns Fighting Club.\u201cGold coins, beauties, here I am!\u201d Zhang Tie shouted inwardly\u2026\u201cStop! Who are you!?\u201d One of the four terrifying armored guardians, who held a sword in hand as they stood outside the gate of the Fighting Club, stretched out a hand to stop Zhang Tie the moment he moved close to the gate.Seeing the polished, full-body armor on that tough guy, who was two heads higher than him, in a split second, Zhang Tie felt weak. \u201cI\u2026 I am here for a job. Captain Kerlin introduced me to this place!\u201d\u201cCaptain Kerlin? Do you have any evidence?\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie hurriedly took out of the letter of introduction. Right at that moment, Zhang Tie realized that the \u201cthorn\u201d pattern on the upper right corner on the back of the envelope was somewhat related to this place.With the letter in hand, the tough guy read it and stared at Zhang Tie. Finally, he gave it back to Zhang Tie. \u201cTake your letter and follow me!\u201dTaking the letter, Zhang Tie followed the tough guy past the gate of the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. Contrary to the scene he envisioned that a scene of a pile of tough guys fighting fiercely, when Zhang Tie entered the fighting club, the first sight he caught was a hall with a fountain that sat in the middle. No other surplus decoration was left on the mirror-like marble stone floor. There were no flowers nor grass. Everything was very neat and tidy. The scene was somewhat similar to the lobbies in the high-end hotels he saw in Bright Avenue. The only thing that made this look like a fighting club was the armors and weapons displayed on both sides of the hall. Some were new, while others were damaged. From them, a chilling killing intent could be felt.The hall was extremely quiet. Quiet to the point where only the sounds of the trickling fountain could be heard.There really were beauties. When the armored, manly guy led Zhang Tie to detour the fountain, Zhang Tie saw beauties \u2014 not one, but a row of them. They were standing behind the reception desk. Zhang Tie felt dazzled when those beauties gazed at him. He slightly became anxious. Before he could carefully appreciate those beauties, the armored, tough guy pointed to a beauty. \u201cHe\u2019s here for a part-time job. Take him to the office of Manager Hance!\u201d The moment the manly guy explained that he was here for a part-time job, Zhang Tie felt the curious gazes of the beauties suddenly leave him. All of a sudden, he became a trivial person once again.\u201cFollow me!\u201d that beauty moved out of the reception desk and talked to Zhang Tie. Then, she walked directly to an path nearby. Zhang Tie hurriedly followed.The beauty in front of him had a ponytail. She was older than 20 years old. She wore a black elastic, sleeveless sweater and a pair of white sweat pant, which palpably accentuated her great youthful figure. She smelt fragrant. Behind her, Zhang Tie saw the wiggly butt beneath the slim waist. It was really seductive. Zhang Tie could only feel that blood rushed to his head as his p\uff01@#s became sturdy in a split second. It was too embarrassing, thus Zhang Tie hurriedly put his hand into a pant pocket to press it down.With the exception of this sexy beauty and Zhang Tie, nobody else was on the carpeted path. Seeing her figure, Zhang Tie felt that he should say something at this moment. Finally, after ten more steps, Zhang Tie plucked up his courage to ask in a foolish way,\u201cH-hello. I\u2026 am Zhang Tie. What\u2019s your name, miss?\u201dThe ponytailed girl stopped and turned around. She glanced over Zhang Tie and raised her eyebrows. Then, she forced a somewhat distant, ironic smile. \u201cI am Mary. Actually, you don\u2019t necessarily need to know my name. Although we are all here to make money, you should know that there is no chance for you, a toad, to f*ck me, a white swan\u2026\u201dFor the first time in his life, Zhang Tie was destructively destroyed. His face turned slightly pale. He also realized that his face twisted. He was really wronged and neither did he know where his fault was. He was simply asking her name. \u201cDo I look like a toad?\u201d At the same time, his fury rose as a result of being ignored and insulted by others.Being insulted, Zhang Tie had to pay it back many times over. Additionally, with rich experience since he was a kid and being influenced by the atmosphere in the male middle school, he deeply realized that when you were bullied or insulted by others, you had to fight back\u2026 Not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, not after you had prepared well, but right now, at this moment. Therefore, anyone who ignored the rule of \u201cfighting back in front of insult\u201d would unexceptionally become an unfortunate guy and a coward who would be casually bullied by others.Therefore, at this moment, Zhang Tie was so brave that he stepped forward and stared at Mary\u2019s eyes sharply. Under the frightening glare of this girl, he seized her exposed shoulders, \u201cWoman, do you believe that one day, you will strip off your clothes and kneel down me to beg me to f*ck you!? Like this\u2026\u201d saying this, Zhang Tie thrust his waist twice fiercely towards the girl in a manner that Hista had always done. Unluckily, the moment he let go of his p*nis, it suddenly popped back up and formed a high tent underneath his pants. As a result, the high tent hit Mary\u2019s stomach twice\u2026Being knocked by a d*ck and being pressed down by the shoulders, Mary was really scared. She had never before thought she would be treated like this by a poor, part-time, and immature boy in the access of the Fighting Club in broad daylight.Before she screamed, Zhang Tie loosened his hands and retreated. Then, he foisted his right hand into his pant pocket once again to press down on the p*nis. Raising his jaw, he looked like a rascal. \u201cLead the way, woman!\u201dZhang Tie\u2019s heart was also thumping at that moment. He never thought that he would do something like this. Recalling the pleasant feeling, Zhang Tie became exceptionally thrilled as his hair stood on its ends.Mary\u2019s face blushed. She opened her mouth but closed it again. Shivering, she pointed at Zhang Tie. After glaring eye-to-eye with Zhang Tie for more than ten seconds, she finally turned around furiously and moved ahead without speaking a word. Zhang Tie finally let out a deep breath. He had made a decision just now that if the girl in front of him dared to shout out, he would escape immediately\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Iron Thorns Fighting Club was very large. The two of them walked for almost one minute in the deep path before arriving in front of a well-decorated room marked with \u201cManager\u2019s Office\u201d\u2026\u201cThis is Manager Hance\u2019s Office. Since I\u2019ve brought you here, you can go inside by yourself!\u201d After saying that, Mary raised her head and, like a swan, drifted away without even glancing at Zhang Tie.Zhang Tie knocked on the door.\u201cCome in!\u201d a man\u2019s voice that reminded Zhang Tie of Donder, the mean fatty, drifted over. He pushed open the door and actually saw a fatty who sat behind a broad desk made from Nanmu wood. He was trying to wipe the glittering brass buttons on his coat with a piece of green flannelette and subsequently blew on them\u2026The moment Zhang Tie saw him, he felt that Manager Hance was definitely more stingy than Donder, who didn\u2019t even provide him with a supper.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead, you should be patient and wait for him until he has finished his matter. Zhang Tie learned this experience from Donder. Thus, since the time he entered the room, he has said nothing. He just stood by the broad desk of the Manager Hance, being patient as he waited for him to polish those nice buttons. Meanwhile, he silently looked around the most luxurious room that he has ever seen.It was truly the most luxurious room that Zhang Tie had ever seen, as he had not seen any high-end places at all in his poor 15 years. Fortunately, the part-time job at the grocery store gave him a sharp eye. The moment he entered, he could identify that the floor was made of cedar wood, the desk of Manager Hance was made of Nanmu wood, and the other furniture, including the cabinets, seemed to be made from Golden Pomelo wood. In a corner of the office, Zhang Tie also noticed a huge, naturally-born one-headed crystal that was heavier than 5kg, resting inside a basin of crystal sand. God! He had never seen this before. Before the Catastrophe, people only used crystals as decorations. However, after the Catastrophe, the real application and knowledge of the crystals were popularized. In this age, everybody knew that any natural crystal heavier than 3 kg was called \u201cCrystal Generator\u201d \u2014 this was common sense. Wherever you put it, its energy and magnetic field could purify and improve the energy within dozens of square meters. It was of great importance to the health and cultivation of human beings. Some even believed that people\u2019s negative moods could be purified and they would be lucky if they were constantly in an energy field created by such a crystal\u2026Zhang Tie estimated that this qualified \u201cCrystal Generator\u201d that weighed 5 kg was worth at least 40 gold coins\u2026 \u201cHow motherf*cking rich!\u201d Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh. This crystal was at least Class 4 which meant it could not even be bought at Donder\u2019s store. It was palpably a standard 'strategic material\u201d that could not be seen in ordinary stores. Only a few franchised stores were permitted to sell them. In Blackhot City, it was monopolized by the commercial groups directly designated by the CSIF. Despite knowing that someone was in the room, Manager Hance, who was polishing his coat buttons, didn\u2019t speak for almost three minutes before he sighed satisfactorily. He took off the flannelette and the monocle, put them away in a drawer, and then glanced at Zhang Tie.\u201cSensible boy!\u201d Manager Hance praised. He seemed to have been satisfied with Zhang Tie, as he had not bothered him when he was doing something elegant. \u201cWell then, show me your ability!\u201dBeing a fatty, Manager Hance\u2019s face looked like a steaming bun that had been punched fiercely. His eyes, ears, nose, and mouth were completely buried in his fat. Compared to him, Donder was slim.Zhang Tie hurriedly moved forward and handed over the letter of introduction to Manager Hance. Then, he stood straight in front of the broad desk and pretended to be innocent. \u201cI am a student from the Seventh National Middle School. Captain Kerlin said that this was a nice part-time job!\u201d\u201cHa, nice, of course. Nice\u2026\u201d Taking the letter, Manager Hance swept over its contents and smiled. Then he glanced over Zhang Tie for a while with a stern stare that made him look creepy. \u201cYou will work here from 6:00 pm to 11:00 pm after school. How many days could you come in per week?\u201d\u201cMonday, Wednesday, and Friday\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie replied after a few seconds. Since he had to work for Donder on Tuesdays and Thursdays and had to help his mom on the weekends, he was only available on those three days.\u201cOnly three days. Although it\u2019s not too much, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Pulling out a piece paper from his drawer, he rapidly scrawled on it. Meanwhile, he poured out without any signs of stopping, \u201cYou can get your payment once a week. You will be paid 70 copper coins per hour when there\u2019s something you have to do, and you can get more paid more if you perform well. Remember to be here on time! If you\u2019re late even one minute, that day\u2019s work will be done without payment. As for your personal expense to get here, we will not reimburse you for it. If there\u2019s any tip from the guest, you can foist them into your own pocket. Kerlin should have already told you what you\u2019re going to do here\u2026\u201d\u201cCaptain Kerlin said\u2026\u201d The moment Zhang Tie wanted to repeat the nice promises told by Captain Kerlin, the door to the room was abruptly pushed open by a man, who hurriedly reported, \u201cManager, the guest in Room No.6 has been impatient\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere is Harry?\u201d standing up, Manager Hance shouted furiously. \u201cIf you offend our noble guests, our gods of wealth, you\u2019re basically sending me to be stripped and thrown into the sewers. Is that what you\u2019re trying to do?\u201d\u201cThe contract terminated yesterday. Harry has already resigned!\u201d the man replied with a cry. \u201cI have already reported this to you. What should we do now\u2026\u201dHance instantly recovered his composure. Two seconds later, the two of them cast their sights onto Zhang Tie at the same time. Hance suddenly gave a friendly smile. \u201c You\u2026 little boy, what\u2019s your name? Come on, sign the contract. You\u2019re very lucky\u2026 yep\u2026\u201dThe fat on Hance\u2019s face shivered painfully. \u201c I will pay you an additional 10 copper coins per hour and this part-time job will be yours!\u201dZhang Tie was thrilled. He never thought that he would encounter such an event on the first day. This job paid very generously and could make him stronger. What was more was that he could meet numerous important people. A job of touching beauties closely might even fall on him.Zhang Tie was really lucky. His compensation had been increased within one hour of arriving. This was the first paid job he has ever had in his life.Therefore, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t hesitate in the least. He directly took the pen passed by Manager Hance, and without even glancing over the contract, he scribbled down his name.After signing the contract, Manager Hance hurriedly put away the contract into the drawer. Before Zhang Tie had a chance to speak, the other man couldn\u2019t wait and began to drag Zhang Tie by the hand towards the door. At this moment, Manager Hance remembered something and shouted, \u201cHe reeks strongly of sweat. Take him to the bath\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, he got such a high compensation of 80 copper coins per hour working for the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. Doesn\u2019t this mean that he could easily make three or four silver coins through four or five hours of work? Three or four silver coins? The happiness arrived so fast that Zhang Tie felt dizzy after hearing the news about his increasing salary. He simply followed others\u2019 orders mechanically, which made him feel like a machine on the production line. He got the full experience of what a streamlined production was \u2014 being urged to take a bath, then putting on soft cotton linen clothes and a pair of stockings.After his bath and putting on clothes, he was pulled aside by someone and was covered in another layer of protective pads and armor. These protective pads and armors were worn on his front chest, back, crotch, and his limbs. They made him feel mighty. Eventually, when half his head was covered with a huge helmet, Zhang Tie felt something was amiss. \u201cIs this the working uniform? So strange? Something must be wrong!\u201dNevertheless, before Zhang Tie was able to ask, he had already been taken into a room\u2026It was a huge room covering about 200 square meters. The floor felt elastic, as it was paved with skid-proof rubber. The four walls were covered in padding that were akin to leather bags. The only person in this huge room was a 12-year-old kid. With red-brown hair, he wore a white uniform that was purposely made for practicing fighting. In a cold demeanor, the kid beat a figure-like doll.Staring at that kid, who also noticed Zhang Tie, he stopped instantly. Zhang Tie also forced a kind smile, striding towards that kid. Lowering himself, he spoke. \u201cHey, little friend\u2026\u201dWithout any warning, the kid turned and made a side kick directly towards Zhang Tie\u2019s head. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t have a chance to say anything before his vision turned dark and passed out\u2026\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter quite a while, Zhang Tie\u2019s nose felt itchy. When he sneezed, he finally woke up. Waking up, Zhang Tie still felt dizzy, as if there were dozens of small figures hammering drums in his brain. \u201cKid, you\u2019re awake\u2026\u201d A bald muscular man that was more than 30-years-old stood before him. There were some wounds on his face. This man looked like he was as strong as an ox. Seeing Zhang Tie open his eyes, the tough man sneered and put away the small porcelain vial on the tip of Zhang Tie\u2019s nose. After putting away the small porcelain vial, he opened a locker beside him and started to change his clothes.Zhang Tie tried to sit up with difficulty. He found that he was lying on a broad and long chair. There were four or five other people in the room. Before he was able to speak, he suddenly felt nauseous. Noticing the trash can at a corner of a locker cabinet, he covered his mouth with a hand and dashed towards it. While vomiting, even his eyes almost popped out; however, besides some viscous saliva, he vomited nothing else. After a while, he finally felt better and returned to that chair. He shook his head and tried to remember what had happened\u2026\u201cWait\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie suddenly stood up, looking around for that kid. \u201cI swear I\u2019m going to beat the sh*t out of you when I see you again!\u201d\u201cBoy, we\u2019re training partners. Faithfully, we\u2019re just flesh-bags. However, you need to learn some skills. Bruises are nothing serious, but you still have to protect your head and your d*ck. You are the first person I have ever seen who sent out their head towards someone\u2019s kick without any protection\u2026\u201d The tough guy, who had just changed his clothes, walked over. He patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders and left the dressing room with a bag in hand.What? Training partner? Flesh-bag? Zhang Tie gasped\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Well, at the very least, he thought that he was not stupid. He was not someone who was easily cheated by others. However, on that day, he found himself to be innocent and naive. On that day, he understood the essence of the proverb \u201chuman beings die in pursuit of wealth, and birds die in pursuit of food\u201d.At this moment, he now completely understood what Captain Kerlin\u2019s words meant.High compensation \u2014 80 copper coins for being fiercely beaten by another person. A hot water bath was also provided before and after being beaten by the people in the event that they reeked of sweat. What high compensation this was\u2026 What human-friendly service this was\u2026Meet influential and rich figures \u2014 people who could afford to use the Iron Horns Fighting Club were all rich and influential figures, as ordinary people could not afford it at all.Strengthen your body when you were free \u2014 nothing else could strengthen your body as much as becoming a training partner and a flesh-bag.Many beauties in the workplace \u2014 there were truly many beautiful waiters like Mary; however, those beauties had nothing to do with him. He was heavily attacked for just asking her name, which almost made him self-abased.Thinking of how he readily accepted this part-time job without thinking, he felt that his life became gloomy once again. Zhang Tie became especially gloomy when he realized that all of his \u201cguests\u201d would be boys of about 12 years of age. It was fine to be beaten by classmates his age, which he could just treat as training at school; however, being beaten by a handful of kids younger than him, he felt that he would be heavily damaged both physically and mentally. Those kids were from influential families. They accepted the best education since birth. Their families spent a lot of resources on them, and they had already been able to ignite their Shrine burning point. They were even stronger than Zhang Tie in every possible physical aspect. He felt really uncertain about such a part-time job, thus after he became clear-minded, the first thing he wanted to do was to resign in Manager Hance\u2019s office. \u201cF*ck you! I won\u2019t do this! I have the chance to give it up!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inwardly.\u2026\u2026\u201cNo way\u2026\u201d Hance\u2019s smile instantly froze when he knew what Zhang Tie wanted to do. He turned stern and shook the contract in his hand like an acrid woman. The cigar in his other hand almost touched Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead. \u201cBoy, before you finish 600 hours of work, you have to compensate us twice the amount in the contract if you want to resign. This means 1200 hours in total at 80 copper coins per hour. You should know how much you have to pay in total since it\u2019s written right here in the contract and you\u2019ve signed here. If you want to quit, you have to pay the penalty. Although we, the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, are powerful, we are not bullying you as we are doing things in accordance with the law\u2026\u201d Gaping at the terms on the contract, Zhang Tie turned pale. He became speechless and started to blame himself for signing the contract without thinking it over. He never thought that there was such a motherf*cking term on it. He would have to pay 9 gold coins and 60 silver coins for breaking the contract. Obviously, this was a price he couldn\u2019t afford.Seeing Zhang Tie turn pale, Manager Hance put away the contract and let out a slow suggestion, \u201cBoy, this job is not as terrifying as you imagine. You are new here and don\u2019t know the skills required to be a training partner, that\u2019s why you suffered a loss. Later on, you will learn from these experiences and become smarter. I don\u2019t know why that bastard Kerlin recommended you, but since you are young, I think you should listen to my advice: \u2018Each difficult challenge you face is a chance for you to grow up\u2019. Think about this advice carefully. Now then, you should feel embarrassed about being beaten by several younger kids. If you can\u2019t even handle one of those small kids, what else can you do in the future? This world is far more sophisticated and difficult than what you have encountered today! Well, since it\u2019s your first time to on the job today and you have learned from this experience, although you have not stood for even one minute\u2026 I am a kind person, so I will pay you half an hour worth of compensation today. Alright, hurry up and go back home. In these past few days, night meals are forbidden in Blackhot City. If you get home late, you might get in trouble\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Exiting Manager Hance\u2019s office, Zhang Tie continued to ponder over what Manager Hance had taught him \u2014 \u201cEach difficult challenge you face is a chance for you to grow up\u201d. Yea! Would he be frightened by those small kids? Would he run away and be laughed at by that b*tch Mary?\u201cNo, no way! I will never be afraid of those kids!\u201dThinking in this manner, Zhang Tie instantly felt much better.When he passed the reception desk, Zhang Tie encountered Mary. Seeing Zhang Tie coming out, Mary muttered something to the rest beauties. As a result, those beauties cast a contemptuous gaze at Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie felt that he had no chance to sleep with beauties like her, as no woman would fall in love with a man whom she had cast a contemptuous gaze on. Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh.\u201cI heard someone was kicked by young master Gregory and passed out within one minute. What a weak man!\u201d Mary\u2019s words instantly stirred up Zhang Tie.\u201cSister Mary, don\u2019t forget our appointment!\u201d Zhang Tie gave a flying kiss to Mary and then thrust his waist, like what Hista usually does, a couple of times towards the rest beauties. This series of movements made Mary\u2019s face turn pale as the other beauties gaped. It seemed that they never imagined that someone would do such weird movements. Then Zhang Tie laughed out loudly, detoured the fountain, and walked out the gate of the Iron Thorns Fighting Club.Standing in front of the mighty gate of the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, Zhang Tie stared at the stars in the sky and waved his fists fiercely. He shouted inwardly, \u201cI will never be beaten!\u201d Closely following his inner shouts was his thunderous belly, which reminded Zhang Tie that he had not even eaten supper yet. Hence, he trotted towards the direction of his home\u2026Peering over Zhang Tie, who was trotting his way home, Captain Kerlin and Hance stood beside the window in Hance\u2019s office. Pulling down the curtain, Hance muttered, \u201cYouth is good! But, this boy doesn\u2019t seem to be able to take a beating like you\u2019ve told me. Do you have a good opinion of him?\u201d\u201cThe boy is smart. If he is able, he will get his reward. If he isn\u2019t, he will get his punishment. He dared to blackmail his classmates in front of me, the intelligent Captain Kerlin. He dared to justify escape in front of me, the brave Captain Kerlin, in such a reasonable way. Since that\u2019s the case, I have to give him a chance to prove himself. I will see whether he is a real man or just simply someone who pretends to be a real man\u2026\u201d with arms crossed, the one-eyed man explained stiffly.\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie returned home in 40 minutes with less than one hour left before the time when night meals became forbidden in Blackhot City. The moment he engulfed all the food and dishes made by his mom and washed the bowl and chopsticks, his parents came home.\u201cWhy did you come back so late?\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad asked curiously.\u201cErm, your son performed well at school, so a teacher introduced me to a part-time job. The pay is really good. I can get familiar with many influential and rich figures, and I can also strengthen my body when I am free. Oh, I almost forgot. There are also many beauties over there!\u201d Zhang Tie raised his eyebrows.\u201cReally? It\u2019s that good?\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad became a bit suspicious.\u201cOf course. I can go there after school on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so I might come home a little late. You don\u2019t need to worry about me!\u201d\u201cWhat a kind of part-time job is it?\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s mom added.\u201cIron Thorns Fighting Club. Those beauties were really enthusiastic. When I was there today, the elder sister who showed me around had praised me and said that I was ambitious. I also made a bet with her that I will definitely make my dream come true!\u201d Zhang Tie pretended to be excited in front of his mom\u2026\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you were praised by a beauty? Your mom is not that easily cheated. Don\u2019t even dream about it!\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s mom flicked her finger on Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead a couple of times.\u201cReally, mom! I mean it!\u201d Zhang Tie gasped with tongue stretched out like a puppy.\u201cThen, tell me! How did she praise you?\u201d\u201cShe praised that I was ambitious!\u201d Zhang Tie pretended to be very serious.\u201cWhat ambition?\u201d\u201cA toad that wants to eat a swan\u2026 Heh\u2026 heh\u2026\u201dHearing this, both his mom and dad considered it as a joke. As a result, Zhang Tie\u2019s dad spat out a mouthful of water as his mom gaped for a while before laughing out loudly. Then Zhang Tie\u2019s mom stretched out her hand to pat Zhang Tie. \u201cYou\u2019re better at joking than before\u2026\u201dAfter freely chatting with his parents, Zhang Tie successfully cemented the idea that he was just an ordinary waiter over there. They both considered this as a chance for Zhang Tie to learn and experience society through working. Judging from Zhang Tie\u2019s happy expression, they didn\u2019t oppose it either. If they knew that he was there to be beaten by kids, they would definitely be saddened and would definitely ask him to stop. Not to mention, Zhang Tie needs to work hard to garner respect!After washing his feet and brushing his teeth, Zhang Tie yawned and returned to his room. However, he didn\u2019t fall asleep. Instead, he entered the Castle of Black Iron. During the past day, the basic attributes also changed a lot\u2026Aura Value changed the most from 1.8 to 3.7 within one day, as those sprouting potatoes in the Castle of Black Iron were growing taller and taller.Merit Value increased from 43 to 47. He received an additional 4 Merit Value points by mopping the desks and chairs for his classmates this morning.\u2014\u2014In the morning of February 26, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Lord did good deeds at his school by mopping his classmates\u2019 desks and chairs, which made everybody in the classroom happy. As a result, Merit Value was increased by 4.Seeing this, Zhang Tie realized that those guys were actually happy inside when their desks and chairs were mopped by others. They just couldn\u2019t control their mouths. Through this event, Zhang Tie knew more about Merit Value.After checking the basic attributes of the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie returned to his field. Those niblets had yet to sprout, while the tender sprouts of the potatoes were as tall as a finger. Compared to two days ago, they\u2019ve already changed greatly. No wonder, the Aura Value had increased so much.After checking on the niblets and the potatoes, Zhang Tie felt a little bit more comfortable. The moment he stood in front of the small tree and prepared to check the number of hours left before the first leakless fruit became ripe\u2026A dialogue box suddenly appeared in front of Zhang Tie.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014On the evening of February 16, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Lord was attacked in the Fighting Club. The attack exceeded your physical standing limit and had already harmed your health. A special fruit from the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree is ready to be produced. Please read the following tip, Handsome and Magnificent Lord!Zhang Tie slightly gasped. After thinking for a while, Zhang Tie moved closer to the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree. The moment he stretched out his hand to touch it, a line of words appeared in front of him.\u2014\u2014Frustrations make you braver. Once you face them bravely, all the pain and strikes you receive will turn into sweet fruits. You should be calm like the motherland and strengthen your body like fine steel.

Although Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know how these bastards found out, Zhang Tie could feel it instinctively and precisely.After the two classes, the group of horny students crowded into the washroom and then talked as they laugh outside the classroom in the hallway. In the morning, the feeling of the sunlight on the human body made one feel comfortable, thus the students pushed each other in the hallway for a bit of that sunlight, as if they were moldy salty fish. Seeing Zhang Tie walking in their direction gloomily, the bastards of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood started to pretend to avert their gaze. They raised their heads and looked up at the clouds in the sky, pretending as if nothing had happened. Every one of them seemed like a poet. F*ck! Zhang Tie guessed that they must be boisterously laughing under their stern expressions.\u201cJust laugh. Stop pretending, it must be hard for you!\u201d Zhang Tie passed by and said lightly. Hearing this, those bastards couldn\u2019t stand it anymore and burst out into laughter simultaneously.\u201cBrother, what unpleasant thing happened last night? Tell us and let us be happy. Hahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cBastards, you knew something was wrong yesterday, so why didn\u2019t you tell me? I was almost beaten to death last night\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie instantly grabbed Hista\u2019s collar as he pretended to be furious.Hista hurriedly raised up his hands. \u201cWho told you to brag yesterday? Bagdad had long guessed what would happen to you, but he thought you were too arrogant, so he didn\u2019t tell you. Do you remember what you had said yesterday?\u201d Hista started to act like Zhang Tie as he said with an obscene smile, \u201cAlas, you know my greatest weakness is my soft-hearted nature and being unable to see others embarrass themselves. I didn\u2019t promise him until Captain Kerlin begged me for a long time. My popularity is really high, I\u2019ve done too many good things. Alas, even becoming close with beauties and high compensation fell upon me. Besides, I can also strengthen my body\u2026\u201dThinking of his performance in front of these bastards and their laughter, Zhang Tie blushed. The old saying from the Chinese clan that \u201cpeople should not be too arrogant, otherwise you will be hit by lightning bolt\u201d was really right! He only pretended a little bit yesterday, yet he already got what he deserved.Zhang Tie stared at Bagdad, who shrugged his shoulders naturally. \u201cCaptain Kerlin is a part-time coach at the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. Previously, he used to introduce our fellow elder students to the part-time jobs in that place, and all the part-time jobs were being beaten by small kids from rich families.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t I know about this?\u201d Zhang Tie asked dejectedly.\u201cThis isn\u2019t a secret at all, but you didn\u2019t pay attention to the information concerning the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. Those kids have strict requirements for their training partners. Being limited in height and body development, their training partners should not be adults and neither should they be kids of the same age, as they would not be able to stand their fierce punches and kicks. This job is better suited for people like us. We are slightly older and stronger than those rich kids; however, as we\u2019ve not yet ignited the Shrine burning point, it\u2019s not possible for us to completely defeat them\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? We can\u2019t beat them?\u201d Hista asked curiously.\u201cOf course not. If we were stronger than them, how could they kick you over so easily?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just training partners, so why do we have to be beaten by those kids?\u201dCrossing his arms, Bagdad sneered, \u201cThis is the distinction between us and those rich people. Although a stronger person could be their training partner, they don\u2019t really need such a person. Do you know why? It\u2019s because those rich people hope that their kids could easily beat us while they are still young. They need their kids to consolidate confidence and mental advantage. Their Qi field could weaken their opponent\u2019s confidence. As if facing an enemy, they would naturally like to be in an advantageous position, hence even though you may reach the same level as him in the future, you would still not be his match. There are many details concerning this, making it rather abstruse. This is a mysterious theory that I have heard from a person in the fighting club.\u201dZhang Tie heard this theory for the first time. He was rather surprised about it; however, he also felt that it might actually be true. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t the fighting club find a young man who was the same age as Zhang Tie that had also ignited the Shrine burning point? It was possible for them to find many people who met this description in Blackhot City. Glaze, for example, was already a LV 2 fighter. What made Zhang Tie even more surprised was that this knowledge was mysterious, meaning only a few people could learn it and was something that most commoners did not know about. Mysterious knowledge was very expensive and included most cultivation skills and fighting skills. It was said that before the Catastrophe, human society\u2019s mysterious knowledge system had already been well developed. Some of them were called \u201cintellectual property protection\u201d, some were called \u201cpatents\u201d, while other mysterious knowledge was only privy to those from mysterious religious groups such as the group who knew about the functions of the crystals. Whereas, nowadays in the Age of Black Iron, most mysterious knowledge belonged to certain groups, various industrial associations, religious groups, various trade unions, various schools, etc. As the foundation and surviving assets of this age, mysterious knowledge was not something that commoners could come into contact with. Although the skill required to use an abacus was not very important, strictly speaking, it was still considered a form of mysterious knowledge that had been popular within Chinese clan. Before Donder taught him this skill, Zhang Tie was warned to not pass them to alien clans. If he violated the agreement, it might bring extremely serious consequences.In the Age of Black Iron, besides resources, once you master a valuable skill or mysterious knowledge, it was possible to become rich and powerful within an area in a short period of time. Of course, you might also be a thorn in the eyes of others due to the mysterious knowledge and may turn into a corpse one day. Mysterious knowledge was related to money. When you monopolize mysterious knowledge and skills, you also occupy the most of the profits accrued from them. This mysterious law seems to have not changed in the slightest, even prior to the Catastrophe.\u201cResign as early as possible. You might suffer mental trauma if you are always being bullied by those kids. By then, it would be really hard for you to become a powerful man!\u201d Bagdad suggested sincerely.\u201cI will consider it; however, I have to finish 600 hours first\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie mentioned the contract on purpose with a sad expression. The huge penalty of 10 gold coins made everybody gape instantly.\u201cWhat motherf*cking mysterious knowledge!? Could it match the Iron Body Fruit that is going to ripen on my Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree?\u201d Given the name of the fruit, Zhang Tie had already known that it was really motherf*cking great. However, what he needed to do was to be constantly beaten by kids to form that fruit. People will pay me as they risk their lives to help me form an iron body from the fruit. What a splendid thing! Zhang Tie felt no failure at all.The moment Zhang Tie rolled his eyes and planned to brag about how Mary praised him so as to rouse those bastards, the whole hallway calmed down. Zhang Tie turned his head and saw Miss Daina entering the amphitheater with a mould of a snail in hand. They stared at her for a few seconds before glancing at each other. In an instant, they all poured into the amphitheater at a speed that was even faster than when they had rushed into the washroom previously. Everybody strove to occupy the front seats near Miss Daina.In the Seventh National Male Middle School, if it was a class taught by Miss Daina, every horny student would take the initiative and pour into the classroom before the bell rang. The best seats in the first row were naturally occupied by Glaze and his followers. In contrast, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood occupied the seats in the middle row, which could be considered neither good nor bad.Noticing that everyone had entered the room, Miss Daina started class immediately. She took up a stick of chalk and scribbled two words on the blackboard.\u2014\u2014Blood Clan!Miss Daina glanced over them with her beautiful eyes. At this moment, all the horny students sat straight like erecting javelins, showing a stern expression and a desire for knowledge.\u201cDear students, for today\u2019s class, I want to talk you about the Blood Clan. The Blood Clan in our age is different from those before the Catastrophe. As described in artworks, mythologies, and legends, the ones before the Catastrophe were vampires that could change into bats; however, they didn\u2019t really exist. The Blood Clan in the Age of Black Iron, however, refers to the mutated, wild living beings and the aliens that emerged after the Catastrophe. The two are completely different from each other. The Blood Clan we usually talk about have the following traits: Firstly, from their appearance, they are always red all over, as if they were covered in blood, and could be easily identified in the wild. Secondly, every living being from the Blood Clan likes fresh blood. They are carnivores and the most dangerous killers in the wild. Any animal with blood would be considered food for them. Thirdly, every animal from the Blood Clan would greatly change physically after the mutation. If they mutate, they would develop some weird abilities that could make them even more dangerous and harder to deal with. Now, let\u2019s take the blood snail as an example. Blood snails are the most common species in the Blood Clan. I will teach you how to handle this thing if you ever encounter it in the wild\u2026\u201dWatching her tender and beautiful face as he listened to her fabulous voice, Zhang Tie gaped. In reality, they didn\u2019t care about what she was talking about. For most people, once they could see Miss Daina standing over there and listen to her voice, they were already content.It was said that a very bad event once happened in class that made Miss Daina extremely angry; therefore, an extremely strange rule, a rule that was considered the strangest rule within all the schools in Blackhot City, was made in the Seventh National Male Middle School \u2014 all students in Miss Daina\u2019s class must put their hands in a visible place. Hence, whenever her gaze swept through the students in her class, all the horny students would sit straight like a well-behaved baby. With hands overlapped on their desks, the student looked desiring for knowledge. After a while, the sound of swallowing saliva spread throughout every corner of the classroom. Besides that sound, there was also the sound of a knocking that was similar to the sound produced by the knocking between a wooden fish1 and stick while a piece of cloth was between them. All in all, there were various sounds and various phenomena. Miss Daina\u2019s classes would always make Zhang Tie hallucinate due to the excitement. Right at this moment\u2026Miss Daina, in a short skirt, sat on the rostrum as a section of her plump and snow white thigh became exposed. The buttons of her upper outer garment couldn\u2019t cover her plump breasts as they dazzled the students. At that moment, only Zhang Tie and Miss Daina were in the classroom. Calling Zhang Tie to go in front of her, Miss Daina lowered her body and tried her best to push her breasts into a ravine that caused people to become awed. Then she pressed down Zhang Tie\u2019s head into the ravine and gave an obscene smile. Before Zhang Tie was suffocated by that mass of snow white, Miss Daina pushed Zhang Tie away and stretched out two of her beautiful fingers, taking out of a slim pipe as she started to blow out pink bubbles one by one. The pink bubbles flew in the air and exploded on Zhang Tie\u2019s face, causing Zhang Tie to be completely intoxicated\u2026\u201cBaby, do you want to give it a try?\u201d Miss Daina showed a seducing smile and curved one of her fingers towards Zhang Tie\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cI will!\u201d Zhang Tie stood up abruptly, which really startled the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. It was close to the end of the class when Miss Daina would ask if the students had any question. Zhang Tie\u2019s sudden reaction almost shocked those beside him to death.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn a split second, everyone in the classroom cast their eyes on Zhang Tie. As a result, Zhang Tie felt hot all over. Glaze, who sat in the front row, turned back to cast a contemptuous look at Zhang Tie. Glaze had already prepared two questions concerning blood snails and pretended to be a well-behaved student, in an attempt to talk with Miss Daina for a while. However, before he was able to stand up, Zhang Tie\u2019s voice had taken away his chance. By the time Zhang Tie had stood up and shouted, he had already become completely clear-minded. Peering around at the thorny looks, Zhang Tie was suddenly sweating all over.\u201cThat male student, do you have any questions about this class?\u201d Miss Daina asked seriously.Thankfully, Zhang Tie was smart. Almost at the same time, he thought of a question that was somewhat related to this class.\u201cMiss Daina, I have almost remembered everything that you\u2019ve taught in this class, but I have a question on other types of living beings. I want to know whether you can help me answer it!\u201d Zhang Tie fabricated a question\u2026Wooden Fish, a Buddhist instrument that is normally knocked on by monks and nuns. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wooden_fishPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I clearly saw him absent-minded just now. Eyes half closed with an obscene smile on his face, his saliva almost flowed down. He was sleep-talking and didn\u2019t know what Miss Daina was talking about!\u201d Leit muttered slightly to Doug. Right then, Barley kicked Leit slightly to tell him to shut up. Barley never knew that what Leit had said was actually true.\u201cLast night, I was heating up water at home. After the water was boiled, I lifted the kettle from the stove and placed it on the ground; however, I forgot to fill the thermos flask with the boiling water. By the time I noticed it, I found that the boiling water in the kettle had already cooled down\u2026\u201d The other horny animals widely opened their ox-egg-like eyes and stared at Zhang Tie. They didn\u2019t know what he was talking about at all. Thankfully, they were the utmost disciplined in Miss Daina\u2019s class. If this had happened in another teacher\u2019s class, Zhang Tie might\u2019ve been miserably hit by rotten eggs thrown by the other students the moment he finished his sentence.Miss Daina listened to him patiently, which allowed Zhang Tie to have enough time to organize his words.\u201cI didn\u2019t think too much at that time and just boiled it again; however, when I thought about this in the evening, I thought of a problem that I couldn\u2019t solve at all. Hence, that\u2019s why I invite Miss Daina to solve it for me. Are each of us like a kettle of boiling water? From the moment we were born into this world, are we constantly losing energy from our bodies minute by minute and day by day unconsciously?\u201d This question was really unconventional, even the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood were shocked. They never thought that Zhang Tie could fabricate such a high-level question \u2014 whether each of them was a kettle of boiling water?This question originated from the message Zhang Tie had seen when the \u201cLeakless Fruit\u201d came into being. Zhang Tie had been unable to comprehend the message, thus he took the opportunity to ask Miss Daina about it.\u201cThis student is really good at thinking. This is a special question. As this is your final semester at school, I had planned to talk about body energy in a later class, but unexpectedly, you\u2019ve already noticed it. So, I will talk about it with you now\u2026\u201d\u201cDingling dingling\u2026\u201dThe moment she opened her mouth, the bell rang. Miss Daina waited until the bell finished ringing before giving an embarrassed smile. \u201cClass is over, it\u2019s time for a break. Since this topic will take much time to explain, let\u2019s talk about it in the next class\u2026\u201dAfter class, a few people left the classroom, while the majority stayed in the classroom. Some students even purposely asked Miss Daina foolish questions concerning the previous biology class, and Miss Daina would patiently answer their questions, seemingly as though she did not notice their intentions. Glaze and his three followers almost surrounded Miss Daina as Glaze talked loudly and laughed exaggeratedly from time to time, as if showing that he was very familiar with Miss Daina. He pretended that he was getting along well with Miss Daina and would turn to the remaining people in the classroom when Miss Daina didn\u2019t notice, showing a pleasant and blatant expression.\u201cGlaze is an idiot!\u201d Hista muttered aside, \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for his accomplished dad\u2026 if it wasn\u2019t for his good family background\u2026 Bagdad could definitely beat him up! It wouldn\u2019t be his turn to show off here!!\u201dThis assessment really made Bagdad pleased. Hearing their assessment, Bagdad made a cold \u201chumph\u201d and gazed at Glaze. Every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood knew that Glaze was the very target that Bagdad had set in his mind to surpass.\u201cI hear that the final recommendation list will be determined by the end of this semester. If Glaze wants to obtain a recommendation to enter the Andaman Alliance\u2019s Military Officer Training Academy, he needs to have a good performance this time. Within our school gates, a LV 2 fighter is truly amazing; however, outside of the school gates, he is nothing at all. I\u2019ve heard that in the recent years, the lowest requirement for apprentices from Blackhot City to join the Andaman Alliance\u2019s Military Training Academy is LV 3 fighter. To conclude my analysis, currently, Glaze is somewhat unqualified!\u201d Leit added.\u201cSuppose he doesn\u2019t get enrolled in the academy. Glaze is already something special!\u201d Sharwin said admirably.\u201cSharwin, the Andaman Alliance\u2019s Military Officers Training Academy is already something special for the commoners; however, it is not the best. We, the Andaman Alliance, are just a small power in the Blackson Human Clan Corridor that could only protect itself reluctantly. In the end, the alliance is not good at combat. Although the Andaman Alliance\u2019s Military Officer Training Academy is a comparatively senior learning agency within the Alliance, outside the alliance, it\u2019s not something to show off about. Outside of the alliance, there were real talents like Li Shizhen, who was directly taken away by a senior member of the Pharmacists Union and became an apprentice of a mysterious senior member. Li Shizhen was thousands of times greater than Glaze. Even Glaze\u2019s dad is just a pile of bullsh*t in front of him!\u201d said Barley like an old man as he Sharwin\u2019s shoulders lightly.\u201cI heard pharmacists could make a lot of money?\u201d Zhang Tie was interested in every highly paid industry, thus hearing the word \u201cpharmacists\u201d, the first thing Zhang Tie thought of was money.\u201cThere are only four pharmacists in the entire Blackhot City. Three of them are long-term advisers at the three fighting clubs in Blackhot City, while the last one is the supplier of the CSIF. Of course, they are rich! No one else could make more money than pharmacists on the whole continent\u2026\u201d\u201cIf only I could be a pharmacist!\u201d the manly Doug said like an idiot.The moment Doug opened his mouth, nobody else replied. Instead, they all turned to him. Doug pretended to be arrogant. After a long while, Barley patted his shoulders. \u201cDoug, I never thought you\u2019d be this funny!\u201dThe ten minute break soon elapsed and the last morning class began. With their hands on their desks, they pretended to sit well again. Without further explanation, Miss Daina started to draw something on the blackboard with a stick of chalk. After a few minutes, a time-honored tree, twisted with numerous vines, appeared. Nobody knew what it meant. Afterward, Miss Daina put the stick of chalk on the desk and turned around as she clapped her hands.\u201cLast class, a student asked whether our human body is losing energy over time. I will now explain it to you with an anatomy diagram of the urine routes and blood vessels neighboring the bladder of the human body. The old tree-like thing is the urine routes neighboring our bladder, and the vine-like things coiling around them are tiny blood vessels, which are similar to the tree roots, that absorb the rarely seen elements and energy from the urine back into the human body in order to avoid waste. The science of anatomy provides a tool for us to recognize the secrets of our body; however, this tool is also limited, as our body is the most precise instrument in the world. The instrument has numerous secrets that could never be explained by anatomy. Actually, even though our body has numerous complex systems and function whose purpose is to reduce the amount of body energy wasted, our body is still wasting a large amount of energy over time. Take urine for example. As you have learned in the survival class, when you are stranded in a cold environment, you would be able to last five more hours than others simply by just not peeing. When you are in a situation where you have no access to food and water, you can collect your urine, and by drinking it, you would be able to last another 48 hours. Urine is very important when it\u2019s concerning life and death, as it contains a large amount of body energy and beneficial substances. The body energy and beneficial substances that should\u2019ve been staying in our bodies run off for no reason. Although our body has adopted numerous means to prevent the loss, it can only slow down the loss. Much of the body energy escapes through various means. I know some special communities use their urine as a medicine, so as to improve their health. The first thing they do after getting up in the morning is going to pee, followed by collecting the urine and drinking it. They believe that they can prevent the loss of body energy and beneficial substances in this manner\u2026\u201dEveryone in the classroom was at a loss for words, for they thought that drinking urine was much more terrifying than the \u201cblood clan\u201d, especially when the words came out of Miss Daina\u2019s mouth. They became so oddly excited that they almost exclaimed.\u201cMiss Daina, are there actually people who drink their urine?\u201d a horny student in the first row couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cThere is!\u201d Miss Daina looked stern. Not feeling embarrassed from the question, Miss Daina seemingly treated it as a purely \u201ceducational question\u201d. \u201cWhen they drink their first urine in the morning, they believe that the energy within the urine could help them maintain their youth and health. Actually, they are all famous person now, as they live longer than commoners. They also treat the urine of children and infants as good medicine to cure diseases. They believe that the urine of children and infants contain the purest life energy!\u201d The whole classroom became bustling.\u201cUsing the example of urine, I wanted to tell you that much of the energy within the human body is wasted over time for no apparent reason. Nobody knows how much energy is wasted precisely. I only know that if a person could recollect all of this wasted energy each day, even a bit of them, it would be a very large amount. Besides urine, there are other ways that waste even more of our body energy!\u201d\u201cWhat ways, Miss Daina?\u201d\u201cWet dreams and masturbation!\u201d Miss Daina looked stern and calm. When the two nouns came out of Miss Daina\u2019s mouth, the classroom oddly calmed down once again. They looked left and right with very weird expressions. Some of them directly lowered their heads and dared not to look at Miss Daina at all. Zhang Tie glanced at those horny students of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood and found very excited expressions on their faces.At this time, no one opened their mouth. Miss Daina looked around and continued, \u201cWhen a sperm from a man combines with the egg from a woman, it could create a living being. Each sperm contains the great miracle of life that\u2019s waiting to enter the world. Have you ever thought about the rule behind it? Each sperm contains huge amounts of life energy. A mature female could only produce one egg a month, while an adult male could produce hundreds of millions of sperms a day\u2014 this means hundreds of millions of life miracles! Do you know how powerful these sperms are? This is something you\u2019d never know and neither would I. The only thing that I know is in the ancient East, Qi cultivators treated the life energy from their sperm as treasures that could make them stronger and allow them to live longer. Besides giving birth to kids, they would never let their sperms flow out for no reason. Another thing that wastes our energy is having too many thoughts in our minds, which consumes a large amount of spiritual energy over time. However, in this age, there are powerful cultivators and fighters who use this large amount of life energy and spiritual energy to ignite their burning points, breaking through cultivation realms one by one solely depending on their self-discipline and mysterious cultivation techniques before finally becoming revered fighters and powerful individuals who can safeguard humanity. If you want to become a powerful person, you have to learn how to prevent your body energy from escaping\u2026\u201d Seeing the students who were thinking over her words in the classroom, Miss Daina showed a pleasant smile. \u201cDo you want to know my dream?\u201dWith their mouths gaping, the horny students stared at Miss Daina. Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes also shone in anticipation, not knowing what she would say\u2026Under their anticipating looks, Miss Daina spoke a paragraph that changed all their views and their outlooks on life and the world.\u201cMy dream is for one of my students to become a powerful fighter or a powerful person who could protect humanity. At that time, I will dress nicely and get married to him. Unfortunately, I have not encountered the right person yet. That\u2019s why, I beg you to make a promise with me\u2026\u201d The mature and seducing smile on her face and her glittering, beautiful eyes made them all gape. They gazed at Miss Daina, who was genuinely beautiful, and said nothing. Unexpectedly, she had said something so surprising.\u201cThe promise between you and I is: marry me when you are strong enough to protect me.\u201dMarry me\u2026Marry me\u2026Marry me\u2026These words reverberated within all of their minds and shocked them all. They couldn\u2019t believe what they had just heard. The classroom instantly became bustling\u2026\u201cDo you agree to make such a promise with me?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI do!\u201d the horny students shouted at the same time, causing the windows to almost shatter into pieces.\u201cWell, then it\u2019s a promise. You are tough guys now, but females have limited youth and it\u2019s impossible for me to wait for my whole life. That\u2019s why, for our promise, if any one of you can become a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter before the age of 20, then I will marry him!\u201d\u201cGood!\u201dAt this moment, they could not understand of the lie called love, which could weave the most beautiful bliss and expectation of the world, becoming the largest driving force for a person to mature. Right then, all the horny students stared at Miss Daina with red eyes, sucking in a deep breath. The only thing they could feel was the blood rushing to their p*nis and their head simultaneously.Zhang Tie also became excited at this moment as a sentence reverberated within his mind \u2014 become a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter by the age of 20\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Like the other horny students, Zhang Tie was also unable to control himself for the duration of the afternoon. For all the undergraduates, this biology class had become unforgettable. Some among them still couldn\u2019t believe that they had made such a promise with Miss Daina. They would never have imagined that they would have a chance to marry Miss Daina one day!Even though the chance was slim, it was still enough for all the horny students to unexpectedly burst forth with high morale. The excitement of the students that afternoon greatly shocked the coach.However, for the duration of the afternoon and even after he had returned from Donder\u2019s grocery store, Zhang Tie kept on thinking about two things.The first thing was the Leakless Fruit. According to Miss Daina, the human body lost a huge amount of energy every day through urine, masturbation, sweat, and even from undigested food. Nobody could tell how much energy they contained. After thinking for a long time, Zhang Tie realized that since last week, he had not had a wet dream for five consecutive days. Usually, he would have at least three wet dreams a week. Does this mean that the life energy from the thousands of millions of sperm was absorbed by the Leakless Fruit? Neither Zhang Tie nor Miss Daina knew how much energy was contained within those sperm. The only thing she had said about this topic was that in the ancient East, there was an ancient, mysterious cultivation system that described some Qi cultivators who converted tangible sperm into powerful, intangible life energy \u2014 \u201cQi\u201d. This seemed to be related to the huge amount of life energy produced by the reproductive system. However, this was only one source for the Leakless Fruit. Zhang Tie recalled that his urine was much cleaner than before. Besides that, he now had a good appetite and sweated less than before when doing exercise. Were these the benefits of the Leakless Fruit?Miss Daina mentioned that these were simply just tangible energy loss, while there was also more invisible energy loss. For example, our body was constantly releasing energy over time. Before the Catastrophe, human beings had already discovered the magnetic field and the brilliant rays circling our bodies as well as an energy called electricity that was produced in the human body every second. In contrast, the source of the most energy loss was something that could not be seen with the eye \u2014 having numerous, ever-changing disorderly opinions and thoughts. This was also known as human spiritual and mental movements. Some of those tangible spiritual and mental movements were called evidence consciousness, while the intangible movements were called sub-consciousness or over-consciousness. Miss Daina had mentioned that mental and spiritual energy was wasted during dreams or disorderly and blind conjectures. This reminded Zhang Tie that he had slept really well for the past couple of days. He was clear-minded each morning. Was the leaking mental energy absorbed and converted by the Leakless fruit?Then what miraculous functions would the Leakless Fruit have after it absorbed all the tangible and intangible energy that leaked from his body for a whole week?This made Zhang Tie become more expectant towards the Leakless Fruit that would be ripe within three days. Zhang Tie still couldn\u2019t figure out what \u201cLeakless\u201d meant. No matter what it meant, he thought that there was nothing greater than the badge of a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter.The second thing that Zhang Tie thought about for the entire afternoon was how he could become a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter before the age of 20. This way, he would become strong and would be able to protect and marry Miss Daina. However, at the moment, Zhang Tie was not able to see even the slightest bit of chance for this to happen.Bloody-Scorpion Fighter \u2014 Among the 5 classes of fighters, a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter was a LV 9 professional fighter that belonged to the 4th class and was authorized by the Continental Fighters Union. A Bloody-Scorpion Fighter would have ignited 34 burning points on their backbone and would have high-end fighting force that could only be awed by many people in the rest of their lives. They were even an existence that was even more powerful than the one-eyed Captain Kerlin. A 20-year old Bloody-Scorpion Fighter \u2014 what a dazzling great existence! If it wasn\u2019t that, who else could match with Goddess Miss Daina?As for the poor boy who had not even ignited his Shrine burning point, how could he become a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter, which required 8 consecutive increase in ranks, within 5 years? This was his only chance to garner the favor of Miss Daina. This was not possible unless he was a genius\u2026But as he had the Castle of Black Iron and the marvelous tree, he became determined to fight for Miss Daina\u2026Thinking of Miss Daina\u2019s promise, Zhang\u2019s heart began to thump.On the way back from Donder\u2019s grocery store, watching the road lamps being ignited one by one, the 15-year old boy had a stern expression. He started to envision the goal that he had never dreamt of before \u2014 to become a powerful fighter with an image of Bloody-Scorpion on his back before the age of 20.Gulugulu\u2026 His belly started to growled once again. \u201cI\u2019m more like a foodie now,\u201d Zhang Tie muttered to himself as he began running home\u2026When he arrived at home, Zhang Tie found the gate unlocked and was even half opened. \u201cIs there a thief?\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s heart started pounding. He slightly pushed open the gate and walked in quietly. Clasping onto a wooden stick that was previously hidden, he moved closer towards the entrance. Before he entered, he heard a strange voice\u201cI only have one daughter at the age of 20, and now she\u2019s pregnant because of your son. She no longer has any face to live. How can she get married anymore? Today, I brought her here for you to bring her into your Zhang family. If you don\u2019t admit that the baby in her belly belongs to your Zhang family, then I\u2019ll beat her to death. If you admit it, you\u2019ll have to tell this news to the neighborhood\u2026\u201d The voice was full of fury. At that moment, Zhang Tie heard a \u201cpa\u201d sound and the curses of that man, \u201cI will beat you to death, you son of b*tch\u2026\u201dA woman\u2019s cry drifted from inside. The moment Zhang Tie entered, he found the door curtain pushed aside and Boss Wang from the tailor store and his wife walked out. Boss Wang looked really infuriated when he saw Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie instantly hid his wooden stick behind him and forced a smile. \u201cBoss Wang, don\u2019t leave so fast. Have a seat\u2026\u201d\u201cHumph, all of you Zhangs are scumbags!\u201d The man left furiously as he hit the gate. His wife glanced over Zhang Tie carefully and followed him away with a deep sigh. Seeing them leave, Zhang Tie closed the gate and hid the wooden stick again. He then pretended to cough and walked into the guesthouse\u2026There were three people inside the guesthouse. Zhang Tie\u2019s dad was smoking with a frown. The smell of the poor quality tobacco spread everywhere. In normal circumstances, Zhang Tie\u2019s mom would definitely scold him; however, his mom was comforting a crying woman, whose head was lowered as she cried. Seeing this woman, Zhang Tie remembered the sound of \u201cpapapa\u201d from his elder brother\u2019s room in the recent couple of months. Then he understood everything. Dad and mom also knew what had happened.\u201cUnexpectedly, my dashing elder brother stirred up some trouble now, heh\u2026 heh\u2026\u201d\u201cYour supper is in the pot. Go eat it now!\u201d Seeing Zhang Tie come back, his mom raised her head reluctantly. She then continued to comfort that girl.Dad also peered at Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie knew what to do. \u201cYou guys continue. I\u2019ll go eat supper!\u201d Then he ran into the kitchen and took out the food from the pot. Although the food was simple, it was made by his mom and smelled fragrant, thus Zhang Tie engulfed it all very soon.After eating, Zhang Tie washed the bowls and chopsticks and cleaned the kitchen to gain another point of merit value. Thinking about it happily, Zhang Tie saw his dad come over. It seemed that his dad and mom had already made the decision.\u201cZhang Tie, come here. I need to talk with you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up, dad!\u201d\u201cYour elder brother, that bastard, he slept with that girl and made her pregnant\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad felt really felt reluctant when he mention that.\u201cDoes this mean I have a sister in law now!?\u201d Zhang Tie asked with a grimace.\u201cQuiet!\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad stared at him with eyes widely opened and flicked Zhang Tie\u2019s head with his fingers which made Zhang Tie spring up from the pain. \u201cAbove all, your elder brother is not at home at the moment, so that girl will live in your elder brother\u2019s room. Be polite and call her sister when you see her. Am I clear? Don\u2019t let her feel uncomfortable\u2026\u201d\u201cUncomfortable with what? She has already entered my elder brother\u2019s room more than once already\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie touched his head as if he was being wronged and muttered.\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s dad widely opened his eyes once again.Zhang Tie hurriedly made a wry smile. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. When I think about how you\u2019re going to be a grandpa, I\u2019m really happy for you!\u201dBefore his dad had a chance to kick his butt, Zhang Tie had long run away. Zhang Tie had already thought it through while he was eating just now. According to his dad and mom\u2019s temperaments, they would never force her to have an abortion. To have an abortion would be a huge problem. Additionally, she was innocent and although she wasn\u2019t beautiful, she wasn\u2019t ugly either. They lived on the same street and almost grew up together under the watchful eyes of mom and dad. No other girl could be her match. The fault lied with his elder brother, who was too rushed and did not make sufficient preparations.When his elder brother returned, the two families would discuss the marriage between the two. Additionally, when Zhang Tie mentioned that his dad was going to be a grandpa, although he looked furious, he couldn\u2019t conceal his excitement.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t think of it too much. After supper, he washed his feet and brushed his teeth. Afterward, he went to the guesthouse to say goodnight to his mom and his sister-in-law before returning to his own room.In his own room, Zhang Tie sat on the bed and started to practice in accordance to <mental>. Through a couple days of studying, he had noticed that cultivation became more effective by visualizing in accordance with <mental>before and after cultivation. If he practiced visualizing in accordance with <mental>before igniting his Shrine burning point, his spiritual energy would be slightly more condensed. If he visualized the golden abacus after cultivating and igniting the Shrine burning point, he could recover much faster. Zhang Tie felt like he has already learned the mysterious functions of <mental>.</mental></mental></mental></mental>Through a couple days of cultivation, Zhang Tie found it to be easier to enter meditation before, as it took less time now.In the past, it would take him more than two hours to enter meditation since he felt distracted. In recent days, he would instantly enter meditation the moment he sat down and closed his eyes. He was always clear-minded now. Being \u201cpolished\u201d by the pure spiritual energy, the Shrine burning point over the navel radiated an increasingly bright indigo flame and responded more easily to the crystal. It seemed that in a couple of months, the flame would become completely blue and would help him reach a higher level. Was all of this the result of the Leakless Fruit? Zhang Tie was not certain about it. No matter what, these were good changes. What made Zhang Tie uncomfortable was the piece of crystal that he used to cultivate. Gradually, it was unable to provide enough energy for him to cultivate. This made Zhang Tie dejected like a thirsty person who moved his mouth in front of the water faucet but found that the size of the tap was as small as a needle. The amount of water that trickled down did not meet his demand. This was rightly what the poor people faced. If Zhang Tie owned a pyramid-based crystal, he believed that his Shrine burning point would already be radiating purple flames.After almost two hours of cultivation, Zhang Tie stood up from the bed and slightly moved his numb legs. Heaving a deep sigh, he placed the white crystal back into the crystal sand by the windowsill, so as to refill the energy. After peering over the pitch dark street which was not matched with roadside lamps, in order to ensure that nobody outside was peering in, he closed up the window again.\u201cWhat\u2019s elder brother doing now?\u201d Zhang Tie suddenly wondered.Before he fell asleep, Zhang Tie entered the Castle of Black Iron as usual.\u2014\u2014Eyes closed\u2026 Lock\u2026 EnterIt felt much easier to enter\u2026Opening his eyes, Zhang Tie found himself already inside.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!Zhang Tie casually touched the basic attributes panel.\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura value: 7.3\u2014\u2014Merit value: 52\u2014\u2014Basic energy storage: 0.5Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014Special output: voidAs expected, he gained 5 more merit value points; 2 at home and 3 at school. However, the growth of spiritual energy really surprised Zhang Tie. After closing the attributes panel, Zhang Tie went to his field. Squatting down, he checked his plants carefully.Surprisingly, he found rows of stubborn, fresh sprouts coming out of the niblets\u2019 land.\u201cThe niblets have already sprouted.\u201d Zhang Tie instantly became excited. They sprouted three days earlier than Zhang Tie anticipated. \u201cIt seems that the soil here is suitable for the growth of plants,\u201d Zhang Tie muttered. Thinking of the increasing price of food, Zhang Tie glanced over the vacant Castle of Black Iron that spanned almost 1,000 mu1 of land. He instantly thought of a crazy idea, \u201cWill I become rich if I plant more than 100 mu of grains and fruits here in the Castle of Black Iron\u2026\u201d1 mu is equal to 666.666 m2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After school on Wednesday, he arrived at the Iron Thorns Fighting Club on Bright Avenue once again. For Zhang Tie, this fighting club has greatly changed his life. Through the part-time jobs at Donder\u2019s grocery store and the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, Zhang Tie could meet numerous people. Some people would have been driven mad by such a mechanical lifestyle, while Zhang Tie simply found it boring. He had already known since he was young that there were only a few people who had the power to choose their own lifestyle. Both of Zhang Tie\u2019s parents were commoners in Blackhot City, thus he was born with no such power. In any age, only a few people could live an easy and cool life with activities like riding battle horses, fighting on the battlefields, hugging beauties, and drinking alcohol. Most people could only do regular jobs before retiring, much like those defective objects on the assembly lines that would be abandoned when sent off. Most people didn\u2019t even have the time to explore and travel the world at all.The Seventh National Middle School in Blackhot City was undoubtedly an assembly line in a workshop where most of the products would be delivered to the army, factories, and farms before being abandoned. If there were no accidents, Zhang Tie might also follow this routine. In the past couple of days, Zhang Tie found himself much more clear-minded than before. He would think about many topics that he would never have thought of or considered before. Refusing to become a bad-quality product that could not choose its own destiny on the assembly line, Barley and the others formed the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, Glaze strove to be a LV 2 fighter since a young age, and numerous people put on the uniforms of pioneers and strove for an uncertain future at the cost of their own lives. In batches, they would step into that unknown black region and never return\u2026When he arrived at Bright Avenue, he recalled the following image: an old man in a pioneer uniform with pure white hair and a beard buying something in a grocery store. He then sat outside the gate of the grocery store and leaned against the wall on the other side of the street. With a broken sword in hand, he smiled, drunk alcohol, and watched the sunset. After a short rest, he stood up, tightened his waist belt, and walked towards the railway station. From then on, Zhang Tie never saw him again\u2026Zhang Tie was deeply impressed by the stark contrast between the old man\u2019s peaceful smile and his situation. Zhang Tie could not fully understand why he smiled when he sat on the roadside ground as he drank the poor quality alcohol and watched the sunset. But that smile on his time-honored face always appeared in Zhang Tie\u2019s memory. At this moment, Zhang Tie gradually understood what the time-honored smile meant. His face displayed pride and gave off a message \u2014 I have tried to live my own way!Everyone in this age was working hard. Some worked hard to become a superior product on the assembly line in hopes to gain higher compensation. Some worked hard to jump out from the assembly line regardless of whether they would lose their life in the process. While others worked hard to become an owner of the assembly line. And those who owned one assembly line wanted to own more!When he was in Bright Avenue last time, everything on the street made Zhang Tie dwarfed and uncomfortable; however, when he was in Bright Avenue at this moment, seeing everything on the magnificent Avenue, Zhang Tie suddenly realized that the \u201cuncomfortable\u201d feeling was simply the natural fear and lack of confidence that an unfinished product felt when it saw its owner and the manager of the assembly line. This was the game rule in the Blackhot City: before you are able to rid yourself of your ordinary status as an unfinished product in the eyes of others, everything on this street would make you breathless.\u201cIt seems that I am changing from an ordinary unfinished product to a good unfinished product! Ho\u2026 Ho\u2026 unfinished product? Motherf*cker, I should not take myself as an unfinished product! Mom would never agree on this. In her eyes, I am her most precious baby! In this world, when it comes to their opinions of me, I will solely pay attention to the opinions of three or four people and will ignore the evaluations of other people! Others\u2019 opinions have nothing to do with me, and I will never pretend to be an unfinished product that was meant to make the lives of others easier!When he recalled that he insisted for his mom to stop calling him \u201cbaby\u201d two years ago and to call him another nickname like \u201cGuoguo\u201d instead, a smile appeared on Zhang Tie\u2019s face. Then, he strode forward with candid and confident steps on Bright Avenue and arrived at Avenue Bright No.18, the place where the Iron Thorns Fighting Club was located.The four guards outside the gate glanced over Zhang Tie and let him enter directly. Zhang Tie stared at their glittering full-body armors admirably. They owned a surprising defensive force. Being similar to the full-body armor worn by the average heavy-armored pikemen, the entire set of armor weighed more than 70 kgs. It looked magnificent and powerful. Those who could move freely in such armor were at least LV 5. For them to arrange four fighters above LV 5 on both sides of the gate, the Iron Thorns Fighting Club was terrifyingly powerful.Entering the gate and detouring the fountain, Zhang Tie arrived at the reception desk once again. Zhang Tie also finally understood why Mary praised him as \u201cambitious\u201d last time. A woman who wanted to jump out of the assembly line by depending on her external qualities, beautiful appearances for example, naturally didn\u2019t want to be related to a guy who seemed to have no bright future. Thinking about what happened last time, Zhang Tie felt like he acted like a rogue and had overreacted.The moment he felt sorry for her, Zhang Tie saw the row of featured beauties once again. Unlike last time when he was soon ignored by them, when he entered this time, Zhang Tie found that all of them were glaring at him, 80% in contempt and the remaining 20% in curiosity. He could easily identify their contempt as they sharply gazed at Zhang Tie, much like a true swan having seen an \u201cambitious\u201d toad. Those who glared at him with contempt proudly turned away their heads, raised their heads, and didn\u2019t look at Zhang Tie again, while those who were curious kept gazing at him with a faint smile.Mary was not here? Zhang Tie glanced over the beauties behind the reception desk and hurriedly put his right hand into the pocket to press down on that relentless p*nis. The beauties were wearing uniforms that consisted of a tight sleeveless shirt with a low-opening collar and a loose pair of sporting trousers. Glancing over them, Zhang Tie saw all the white skin and plump breasts, causing him to almost have a nosebleed.As nobody greeted him, Zhang Tie also didn\u2019t want to cause trouble, so he passed the reception desk. Several steps later, Zhang Tie heard discussions behind him.\u201cHe\u2019s just a kid. It couldn\u2019t have been that bad!\u201d\u201cYou cannot judge people by their appearance. Kids these days mature early. Mary said this guy was really disgusting and even more excessive than those guests. He wanted to molest Mary the first time he saw her. Besides, he even did obscene movements to us!\u201d\u201cReally? But he doesn\u2019t look like the type of person!\u201d\u201cIs your heart pounding? You can go give him a try!\u201dThen their laughter drifted towards Zhang Tie\u2026\u201cF*ck!\u201d Zhang Tie knew that his good image had been fully destroyed among them.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was his second time here. Naturally, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t need to report to Manager Hance\u2019s office; instead, he just needed to report to Director Beck, who was the one he had met in Manager Hance\u2019s office. His main responsibility was to take charge in greeting the LV 1 guests in the Fighting Club. In other words, he in charge of serving those rich and powerful kids. As the flesh-bag of those kids, Zhang Tie was naturally managed by him. Director Beck always spoke too many words, which might be attributed to his occupational disease. Sometimes, he would unconsciously repeat what he had said already for several times.Seeing Zhang Tie come to report to him, Director Beck was very happy. He then murmured to Zhang Tie in his narrow office for more than half an hour. He told Zhang Tie about what he should pay attention to, such as where he could go and where he couldn\u2019t, etiquettes towards guests, and some rules that he should remember as a \u201ctraining partner\u201d. Although they were all simple and trivial things, Director Beck unconsciously repeated them twice.Half an hour later, noticing Director Beck couldn\u2019t control himself and started to repeat them for the third time, Zhang Tie felt the blood rush to his head and hurriedly opened his mouth to stop him.\u201cWell, Director, I\u2019ve remembered everything you have said. Should I go take a bath and put on my uniform now to wait for the guests in the rest area?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Looking at the clock that hung in the office, Director Beck opened a drawer and threw a key with a number plate to Zhang Tie \u201cThis is the key to your locker. Put your personal belongings inside. You have two uniforms change \u2014 the clean set will be worn when you arrive each time, while the dirty set can be handed over to the reception desk where someone will wash it for you. We will provide a new pair of socks for you every week. These are your benefits! Work hard, young man!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As he was somewhat lost when he was here last time, he didn\u2019t clearly see the size of the fighting club. This time, he realized that the fighting club was really huge.The sixth floor of the fighting club was more than 200m in length, and more than half of this floor was reserved for LV 1 guests. The sixth floor was mostly occupied by a public training field, which included various equipment and instruments that Zhang Tie had never seen before, as well as two standard speed testing tracks. Aside from the resting areas and the dressing rooms, the public training field was the only place where workers could stay. What Captain Kerlin had said was not out of reason. If Zhang Tie could train here when he was free, he could definitely improve his strength and physique greatly. Compared to this training field, the training field at school was like a rural field being used to dry fresh millets. Seeing those training equipment for the first time, Zhang Tie almost began to drool. Those training equipment could definitely strengthen each and every one of his muscles. In truth, given enough time, Zhang Tie was fully confident that they could make him as masculine as a sculpture and strengthen his physical traits greatly.Aside from the public training field, there were also some independent training rooms. Director Beck had said those training rooms were matched with more advanced training equipment and were only available to guests, causing Zhang Tie to be extremely curious about the special equipment.Zhang Tie could only use the independent staff staircases and paths from the first floor to the sixth floor, while the guests and VIPs were qualified to take the elevators, something which Zhang Tie had never seen before. Although there was no electricity in this age, that traffic tool invented by humans before the Catastrophe was still preserved. However, the driving force of elevators became steam engines and turbines that were built within the building. Additionally, each elevator was matched with a professional looking worker who wore a uniform.From the first floor to the sixth, although sound-insulation partitions were installed, Zhang Tie could still hear the loud crashes and cries from the rooms on each floor. Some of the sounds seemed to have originated from underground, giving off a feeling that was akin to rolling thunder to those above ground. As a result, the entire staircase hummed\u2026The sixth floor was for LV 1 guests, the fifth floor was for LV 2 guests, and the fourth floor was for LV 3 guests. Previously, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t understand why they were arranged in this manner. When he went upstairs, he suddenly realized that the higher the level of the guests, the more powerful and destructive the training would be; therefore, they had to arrange the high-level guests on the lower floors in order to reduce the damage to the building. The training fields for guests above LV 5 were on the ground; however, Zhang Tie was not qualified to know what was installed inside those training fields.Zhang Tie went to his locker, locker No. 613. The dressing room was linked to the bathroom, which was one of the benefits of the Fighting Club. At the very least, Zhang Tie could take a bath in the luxurious bathroom. This place would be very nice if he wasn\u2019t here solely to be beaten.Entering the dressing room, Zhang Tie found no one else but a muscular man sitting on the bench. The muscular man was trying to apply something to the obvious wounds on his back. Feeling that this man seemed somewhat familiar, Zhang Tie recalled that it was the man who had woken him up when he had passed out last time.Seeing Zhang Tie, the manly guy grinned and smiled simply. Raising a brown vial, he said, \u201cHey boy, so it\u2019s you. Come help me out!\u201dZhang Tie walked over and took the vial from the man\u2019s hand; it smelt like a medicinal liquor. He didn\u2019t know what it was made of, but he knew that it was used to speed up the healing of wounds, thus Zhang Tie rubbed his hands for a while and put some of the medicinal liquor on one palm. He then evenly applied it onto the wounds.\u201cI almost forgot, you woke up me up last time. Really, thank you!\u201d Zhang Tie said as he applied the medicinal liquor onto the man\u2019s back.\u201cIt\u2019s no problem! I\u2019m Anuo, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cZhang Tie!\u201d\u201cChinese clan?\u201d\u201cYea!\u201d\u201cYou people from the Chinese clan aren\u2019t physically strong. I\u2019ve rarely seen a Chinese training partner here!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s bullsh*t. I will keep getting stronger!\u201d Zhang Tie replied stubbornly.\u201cWhat a tough boy!\u201d the manly guy muttered.After he finished applying the medicinal liquor, Zhang Tie covered the vial and gave it back to the manly guy. The man took the vial, stood up, and prepared to wear clothes. All of a sudden, he shot out a powerful punch toward Zhang Tie. Before Zhang Tie was able to respond, the fist had already arrived in front of Zhang Tie\u2019s face. The fine hair on his face could even feel a strong gust. The moment Zhang Tie thought that his head would be broken like a watermelon, the fist stopped 1 cm away from his face. Zhang Tie\u2019s face turned pale.The manly guy didn\u2019t care for Zhang Tie\u2019s response. He simply shook his head and made three movements in front of Zhang Tie. \u201cAs a training partner, you should remember three basic movements. Firstly, when you lower your head, you should protect your head with your arms. Never expose your head to your opponent. You should respond to it unconsciously\u2026\u201d The manly guy demonstrated the movement twice.\u201cSecondly, although it is not allowed in the fighting club, if your opponent attacked your lower body, you should lift your right leg\u2026\u201d The manly guy patted his strong right leg. \u201cYou should never put the center of gravity of your body under your feet. That would make you react slowly; instead, you should do this\u2026\u201d The tough guy quickly raised his right leg and leaned to his side. \u201cThis way, your opponent\u2019s instinctive attacks will land on the muscles of your thigh and butt, which can afford to take a hit!\u201d\u201cThirdly\u2026\u201d The tough guy bent his body. \u201cMake your back naturally bent to tighten the muscles. A bent back and tightened muscles can form a natural arch which can let your back stand powerful attack. This will protect your bones and guts. If you cannot avoid your opponent\u2019s attack, you should use the places on your body that can take a beating to absorb the opponent\u2019s attack. For example, your shoulders, back, chest\u2026 Am I clear, boy?\u201dZhang Tie was shocked by Anuo\u2019s patience. He nodded and was slightly moved. He didn\u2019t know what to say while Anuo simply smiled. He patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m expecting you to become powerful!\u201d He then put on his clothes and left.Zhang Tie repeated those movements several times alone in the dressing room and slightly nodded. Then he opened his locker. There were two sets of uniforms, a clean towel, and a pair of clean socks. He instantly removed his clothes and brought the towel into the bathroom to take a comfortable hot water bath. The moment he wore his uniform and his socks, a worker came in to inform him to make preparations to serve the guest in Room No.4.Near the dressing room was a professional equipment room. The moment Zhang Tie entered, two workers helped him put on a set of protective equipment.\u201cBoy, don\u2019t get knocked out this time; otherwise, we\u2019d have to carry you back!\u201d the man said with a smile of contempt as he helped Zhang Tie put on the complex equipment. After he finished, he patted Zhang Tie\u2019s back twice, implying that Zhang Tie could leave.\u201cDo you think he\u2019ll be knocked out this time?\u201d\u201cI bet he will pass out within 10 minutes for 20 copper coins!\u201d\u201cI bet he will pass out within 5 minutes!\u201d\u201cOk, that\u2019s the deal!\u201dHearing the two bastards sneering at him, Zhang Tie gritted his teeth and decided to not pass out this time.Entering Room No.4 like last time, Zhang Tie waited there for less than 3 minutes before the door was pushed open. Entering together with an arrogant 12-year-old kid was Mary. Seeing the cold smile on Mary\u2019s face, Zhang Tie cried out inwardly. How could she be so narrow-minded!?The kid arrogantly glared at Zhang Tie. \u201cMary, is he the scumbag you told me about?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s him!\u201d The goddamned Mary nodded.\u201cIf I knock him out, you will?\u201d saying this, the arrogant kid gazed at Mary\u2019s plump breasts and swallowed saliva with difficulty.Mary said nothing. She simply bent her body and showed a lecherous smile. Stretching out her tongue, she licked one of the kid\u2019s ear and murmured something as the kid began to laugh in high spirits.Zhang Tie coldly stared at the two. Within the depths of his heart, an uncomfortable appeared when he saw Mary\u2019s lecherous smile and the arrogant kid. He didn\u2019t know if it was because of fury or desire.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI am Zhang Tie. It\u2019s my pleasure to serve you!\u201d Zhang Tie clasped his fist and greeted the kid monotonously in accordance to Director Beck\u2019s instructions. Meanwhile, he coldly glanced at Mary, who was staring at him pleasantly on the side.Under the thick head protector, others could only see the pair of black eyes and the row of holes for breathing. Seeing Zhang Tie turning back as he stared at her, Mary felt savageness and a coldness that was akin to ice through that head protector. Her heart started to pound and her smile instantly froze.\u201cIf you are smart enough, you should kneel down in front of Mary, apologize to her, and slam your face ten times. If you do that, I will let you go. I won\u2019t beat you up too fiercely!\u201d pretending to be a man, the kid shouted.F*ck! How could these rich kids be so disgusting!? Zhang Tie said nothing. He only bent one finger towards this kid in contempt as if he was calling a puppy or a pet. \u201cCome on, baby!\u201d\u201cI will kill you!\u201d In a split second, the kid charged toward Zhang Tie and launched an extremely sharp kick toward Zhang Tie\u2019s stomach\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, Zhang Tie had long been prepared and instantly avoided it by leaning his body. As a result, the kick didn\u2019t hit him. Before he had time to rejoice, Zhang Tie noticed a punch rushing towards his chest. At this moment, Zhang Tie intended to test the kid\u2019s strength by grabbing onto his arm. A muffled sound was heard from the armored arm of Zhang Tie. He felt a strong impact on his arm, causing his arm to become numb. Being forced to take a few steps back, Zhang Tie was surprised at the strength contained within that punch. It almost matched his own strength. Zhang Tie never realized that this kid, who was two years younger than him, was so powerful. Given the strength of that punch, Zhang Tie knew that the kid was slightly more powerful than him and was slightly weaker than Bagdad.Even then, fighting him alone, Zhang Tie was not afraid of him in the least. After all, he was a couple of years older than this kid, meaning that he at least held the advantage in height and weight. However, if he could only be beaten and not retaliate, then the result would be obvious.Although the thick armor uniform could lessen the impacts from his enemy\u2019s attacks, it also affected Zhang Tie\u2019s agility. Several fighting moves later, Zhang Tie\u2019s response was delayed by the uniform, and as a result, the kid took this opportunity and directly kicked Zhang Tie in the chest, sending Zhang Tie through the air before landing on the ground.Zhang Tie felt dazed and suffocated. Panting, he picked himself up from the ground after quite a while. At the same time, Zhang Tie saw Mary wiping the sweat off the kid with a towel and kissing his face while the kid still displayed an arrogant face as he drank water and glared at Zhang Tie in contempt.\u201cI thought you would be powerful, but you\u2019re just trash!\u201dZhang Tie felt like he would lose face if he argued with such an innocent kid. Should I tell you that I\u2019m only here to be beaten to ripen the Iron Body Fruit? You\u2019re actually here to serve me. Hah, what a nice feeling\u2026\u201cManjusaka Karma Fruit Tree, I love you!\u201d Zhang Tie shouted inwardly\u2026Under the head protector, Zhang Tie forced an ironical smile. As he was focused on helping the Iron Body Fruit ripen, he didn\u2019t care about being beaten at all. After standing up, Zhang Tie slightly moved his limbs and took a few deep breaths. Besides the pain from his chest, everything else felt fine. Once again, he bent his index finger towards that kid.\u201cCome on, baby!\u201d\u2026\u2026The anger on the kid\u2019s face flashed instantly. He put down the bottle of water and rushed towards Zhang Tie once again. Seven or eight minutes later, Zhang Tie was sent flying by a leg-sweep and fell onto the ground miserably. It took him half a minute to pick himself back up. At this moment, the kid was already panting.\u201cCome on, baby!\u201dMore than twenty minutes later, the kid broke Zhang Tie\u2019s guard and seized the opportunity to quickly throw out four or five consecutive punches towards Zhang Tie\u2019s chest. As a result, Zhang Tie was hit and was forced five steps back. Soon after, the kid shouted as he elbowed Zhang Tie\u2019s stomach using a bow step[1]. Zhang Tie directly felt blood rushing to his neck, and the vessels around his neck were painful and swollen. Aside from this, his eyes were dazedAs his stomach was soft, Zhang Tie wasn\u2019t sent flying; however, he felt as if he was stepping on a marshmallow and had to kneel down. At the same time, Zhang Tie felt a gust blowing over his ear. In a split second, he used what Anuo taught him and instinctively used his arms to protect his head.\u201cBang!\u201d The moment Zhang Tie responded, a muffled sound reverberated. At the same time, Zhang Tie felt a powerful kick and instantly fell onto the ground. He rolled several times on the ground before stopping two meters away, losing the power to move.Once again, Zhang Tie saw the kid heavily panting and sweating all over. He was staring at Zhang Tie, who was lying on the ground. A fight like this meant a huge physical exhaustion to both the attacker and the defender.In the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, there were only a few training partners who fully worked as flesh-bags like Zhang Tie. As training partners, besides being beaten, they were sometimes here to assist the members improve their fighting techniques. Additionally, training partners could exchange their experiences with one another. In fact, a senior training partner was a mentor who could help guests of the club improve themselves. During training, training partners could find the mistakes of the opponent, like the weaknesses of his attacks, wasted movements, problems in attack rhythms, and possible defects that might arise from mental preferences. The guests were able to benefit from these experiences and improve their fighting techniques. Golden training partners usually got along well with the experts of the fighting club and were one of the most important figures in the fighting club. As Zhang Tie was new here, he was not eligible to meet the top figures in this industry. Moreover, the opponent today was invited by a woman who was specifically here to give him trouble. Naturally, he would not show sympathy. As a result, the fight today was a little bit harder\u2026 If it was not Zhang Tie but someone else, they would have long been defeated. Even if they weren\u2019t defeated, they would still feel the obvious frustration and hopelessness that came after being beaten repeatedly by a kid.However, lying on the ground, Zhang Tie was not thinking about that; instead, he was thinking about the kid\u2019s kick. After recovering his composure, Zhang Tie realized that he should not have covered his head with his arms to prevent from that kick, but rather he should have withstood it with his shoulders or his back, which were the places on the human body that could take the most beating. When met with an unavoidable attack, you have two choices \u2014 the positive choice was to hide or to defend, while the negative choice was to intercept the attack. With a different choice, you would face a different result. However, hiding and defending were the natural instincts of human beings. Without experience or training hard, it was impossible to alter this natural instinct in front of a life or death situation.Thinking it through, Zhang Tie slowly picked himself up. \u201cI have benefitted from those kicks. The Iron Body Fruit in the Castle of Black Iron should be ripe soon! Haha, I really can\u2019t wait for it. Come on! More kicks! You are working for me, but I will not pay you! I\u2019m not mistreating him like what a boss did to a child laborer. Haha\u2026Different perspectives on an event may lead to completely different feelings, which would cause different attitudes and bring different results, forming different fates. At this moment, due to the existence of that small tree, Zhang Tie had a stronger mental fortitude than others, who would normally be afraid of those terrifying attacks. Though, at this moment, Zhang Tie had yet to realize this.Zhang Tie felt like he could derive pleasure from watching others work until they\u2019re tired. Like an immortal spring in the desert, this job made him energetic, rather than feeling pessimistic and frustrated.After Zhang Tie recovered his strength, Zhang Tie slowly picked himself up. Twisting his neck and body, Zhang Tie bent his index finger towards the kid and Mary.\u201cCome on, baby!\u201d\u2026\u2026Several minutes later, Zhang Tie was knocked over once again. Then he stood up again in an optimistic and absent-minded manner\u2026\u201cCome on, baby!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cCome on, baby!\u201d\u2026\u2026Outside the ring, Mary became increasingly frightened whenever she saw Zhang Tie constantly being knocked over and picking himself up in an absent-minded manner. It seemed that Zhang Tie was addicted to being beaten and even grew increasingly aggressive after being beaten. Besides his increasing aggression, in Mary\u2019s eyes, Zhang Tie\u2019s face gradually became more and more ferocious and looked much more stubborn than before.\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know how many times he had tried to pick himself up. He felt pain all over. Finally, he was no longer able to stand. He simply sat on the ground, panting for air.As his body was sweating all over, Zhang Tie\u2019s clothes fully stuck to his skin.His sweat had also entered his eyes, causing his eyes to become hot and blurry. Trying to wipe his sweat, Zhang Tie attempted to undo the damned head protector that almost broke his neck; however, he was unable to touch the thin string on the back of his head. At this moment, Zhang Tie even found it difficult to lift up his hand.A bottle of water rolled towards Zhang Tie\u2019s feet. Zhang Tie reluctantly glanced at that kid, who was also threw himself onto the ground, as his face turned slightly pale. His sweaty hair stuck onto his head. The kid was drinking a bottle of water like a fish as he looked at Zhang Tie in an indescribable manner that lacked any trace of arrogance. Behind the kid, Mary was giving him a restorative massage. She didn\u2019t even look at Zhang Tie.Zhang Tie then also took the glass bottle of water. He opened the glass lid and intended to have a drink; however, he realized that he had not even undone the head protector. As there were only several rows of holes for breathing over his mouth and he was already too weak to undo the head protector, he covered the glass lid cooly.The two simply stared at each other as they gasped for air. After a while, that kid staggeringly picked himself up and recovered his arrogance. \u201cRemember my name. Beneta, Andrew Beneta. I swear that I\u2019ll beat you so ferociously that you won\u2019t be able to get up next time. I won\u2019t stop until you apologize to Mary\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe kid then left the room with Mary. Seeing Mary\u2019s back, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but flirt with her. \u201cSister Mary, don\u2019t forget our appointment!\u201dMary\u2019s back quivered, seemingly as if she would fall down\u2026\u201cAre my words that powerful?\u201d Zhang Tie intended to scratch his head curiously but found his fingers touching the thick leather layer. \u201cF*ck! Who invented such a head protector\u2026\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Bow step \u2014 a martial skill by bending your knees to form a bow for the benefit of attacking the opponent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Thankfully, there were only a few bruises on his body and none on his face. Therefore, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t need to worry about his bruises being discovered by his dad and mom.After supper, Zhang Tie chatted with his dad, mom, and sister-in-law for a while. After washing his feet and brushing his teeth, Zhang Tie stealthily took two sweet potatoes and a handful of soybeans to his bedroom.Zhang Tie then naturally began his land reclamation inside the Castle of Black Iron. Beside the sprouted niblets land and the potatoes land, Zhang Tie buried the two sweet potatoes inside the soil and sowed a row of soybeans like what he had previously done with the niblets.When those sweet potatoes sprouted, he would need to move the sprouts into separate pits like what he had done with the potatoes. This was something that was taught in school. As for the soybeans, similar to what he had done with the niblets, he simply poked holes with the steel bar and buried them into holes one by one.The aura value in the Castle of Black Iron kept increasing and had already broken through to 13. On Wednesday, besides those sprouting niblets, Zhang Tie had found that the casually spread grass seeds had also sprouted from the ground.Over a day was left before the first Leakless Fruit would become ripe. On the other twig of the small tree hung a tiny silver fruit. Touching the fruit, Zhang Tie found that the fruit still had a bit less than three-quarters of progress to go before it became ripe. It seemed that the fruit would almost be ripe after another four to five beatings.Leakless Fruit\u2026 Iron Body Fruit\u2026 Heh heh heh heh\u2026Finishing his cultivation as usual, Zhang Tie muttered the names of the two fruits as he fell asleep\u2026On Thursday morning, when Zhang Tie\u2019s biological clock passed 6:15, Zhang Tie woke up. The moment he wanted to get off the bed, his face turned pale. Dense drops of sweat appeared all over his forehead as excruciating pain could be felt all over his body. Every place where he was beaten was so painful and was almost broken, especially his two hands that were used to block kicks and punches yesterday. This phenomenon could be explained through two reasons. Firstly, this was a natural reaction from his body after suffering from external damage after a night\u2019s worth of rest. Secondly, it seemed that he truly exercised a lot yesterday; therefore, his muscles ached and felt swollen after one night\u2019s rest.He sucked in a deep breath and slowly put on his clothes. During this process, whenever he made a slight movement, he would feel an indescribable pain.Zhang Tie now understood that it was not that easy to be a training partner, and the Iron Body Fruit was also not that easily obtained.Today, it took Zhang Tie twice as long to get to school from his home. Throughout the day, he moved sluggishly.Arriving at the school gates, Zhang Tie saw the august, one-eyed man standing outside the school gate. With lowered heads, students walked past the school gate as far away from him as possible while he patted the iron stick on his other palm, producing a loud sound.\u201cGood boy, I heard you performed well yesterday. You didn\u2019t make me lose face!\u201d Zhang Tie did not expect that Captain Kerlin would praise him before he greeted him.Looking bashful, Zhang Tie forced a smile. At this moment, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know whether he should thank or hate this one-eyed man.Arriving at the classroom, Zhang Tie realized that the horny students weren\u2019t discussing amongst themselves about why nobody cleaned their desks and chairs. Instead, a group of his horny classmates was hiding in a neighboring classroom this morning in hopes to see the \u201cidiot\u201d who arrived early each morning to clean their desks and chairs. Unfortunately, they were unable to find anyone at all, thus they became boisterous.\u201cMotherf*cker, I have to secretly do good deeds from now on,\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself. Since his horny classmates were so curious, he was no longer able to use this method to earn merit value points.After acquiring the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t want to become the center of attention at school or the classroom, as it would be quite strange for a normal student to do good deeds so passionately for no apparent reason.Although it was difficult for people to associate what Zhang Tie did with the merit value points from the illusory land, Zhang Tie still thought it would be considered wise to be low-key.The morning classes proceeded as usual. Perhaps due to the fact that they would leave school forever in two weeks, the teachers taught fewer theories than before; instead, they lectured about their experiences. As a result, the students would sometimes be completely immersed within their teacher\u2019s life experiences and perceptions.Starting next month on June 1 and ending on August 31, according to the rules held by all schools in Blackhot City, every undergraduate would have to participate in a two-month mandatory survival training. This test was a great assessment of the knowledge and abilities that the students had learned at school. As the survival training was the best test, no other test would be arranged. Consequently, those unqualified to survive in this age would be eliminated. Every year, there would be casualties among the undergraduates of Blackhot City during the survival training. Last year, five students were eliminated; four of which were dead, while the other one became a cripple. In its history, more than twenty undergraduates from the Seventh National Middle School have been eliminated during the survival training. For the horny undergraduates, the two-month survival training was seen as a coming-of-age ceremony.It would be a coming-of-age ceremony at the cost of one\u2019s blood \u2014 and even one\u2019s life! This coming-of-age ceremony was without the protection of the high city walls of Blackhot City, implying that the horny students would encounter the most realistic situations in this age.After two months of survival training, their days as students would come to an end. Following the survival training came a three-month holiday before most of them would be enlisted in the army to serve for a long term. Over their three-month holiday, before receiving the official notice of serving the army, a few talented individuals would have the chance to obtain the recommendation from school and would have the opportunity to learn in a more advanced place. They would directly become the elites of the age and would be backed by many huge powers and organizations. By this point in time, the direction of many people\u2019s lives would have already been fixed. The period of serving in the army was equal to the time they spent in compulsory education. It was their right to accept compulsory education and their obligation to serve the army. Eight years later, when most people finished serving the army, they would realize that they are completely different than those who had a chance to accept better education.After the four classes in the morning, those horny undergraduates rushed into cafeteria again. Like usual, when the group of students lined up to get a dining plate, Glaze\u2019s group swaggered inside. Jumping the queue, they became the first in line after chasing away the timid and unlucky fellows at the front of the line.Look at the way Glaze\u2019s group acted over the past few days, Zhang Tie always asked himself, \u201cWhat would I do if that unlucky moment happened to me?\u201d Within his heart, he knew the answer. Every time at lunch, he would choose a spot near the end of the line. He would try to avoid trouble; however, for a 15-year-old adolescent, this was a really hard choice.At lunch, Fatty Barley told Zhang Tie that he would help Zhang Tie complete another coming-of-age ceremony.\u201cFrom then on, all of us, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, will no longer be virgins!\u201d Hearing Barley\u2019s great declaration, the horny brotherhood members at the table smiled obscenely.In truth, although Zhang Tie was dreaming a day ago about his \u201chappy life\u201d and the \u201castounding love\u201d between him and Miss Daina in the future, hearing Barley\u2019s declaration, Zhang Tie\u2019s heart started pounding. He gradually aspired to become a real man. After a series of images came to mind, his crotch area of his trousers finally raised up like a tent. Zhang Tie then had to admit that as a member of the horny students, he was not more sensible than the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. However, Zhang Tie still considered his affection for Miss Daina sacred!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFor the remainder of their lunch, the horny members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood started to laugh at Zhang Tie\u2019s raised tent. However, as Zhang Tie has gotten used to these guys, he didn\u2019t mind it. After lunch, those guys went to play cards in the classroom, while Zhang Tie entered the small woods beside the cafeteria and sat down to cultivate <mental>. According to the book, he had to visualize the three-column abacus in a split second in order to reach the requirements of the first level. Once he reached the first level, he would instantly be able to get the computation result of the four operations within three digits.</mental>It was still quite a distance away from reaching the requirements of the first level described by the book. Within 15 seconds, he was only able to visualize the three-column abacus, and it took him longer than 4 seconds to compute using the four operations. When he thought of the sentence on the cover of that book \u2014 After-Class Readings for Preliminary Students \u2014 Zhang Tie felt ashamed. This seemed like an ability that was mastered by preliminary students, yet he was not able to reach the first level even after so many days of practice \u2014 so ashamed!!At that moment, it seemed that someone wanted to make him even more ashamed. Standing in front of Zhang Tie was one of Glaze\u2019s followers. While Zhang Tie was curious about his sudden appearance, the slightly gloomy guy threw a pile of dirty dining plates onto the patch of grass where Zhang Tie sat.\u201cClean them and hand them over the cafeteria!\u201d The guy threw the dining plates and left without even glancing at Zhang Tie It seemed as if he had never considered that the common looking student sitting against the tree would refuse his orders.Gazing at the four messy plates, Zhang Tie scratched his head and felt dejected. There were always some hard choices that you had to make in life\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The instant the bell rang, the horny students instantly assembled into a matrix formation and waited for the orders of the coach, who would usually wave a flag as he stood on the commanding platform. However, nobody appeared on the commanding platform until two minutes later. During this period, every one of the horny students held their breaths. Then instead of the coach they were familiar with, the awesome one-eyed man appeared. The icy, cold Qi field around him frightened everyone beneath the commanding platform. Not knowing what was about to happen, they realized after seeing the black leather whip in his hand and began shivering.As a semi-militarized school, extremely strict punishments would be meted out to students who didn\u2019t follow the rules. Among all punishments, the least offense punishment was running dozens of laps around the playground, while in some cases they would be whipped. However, in the worst case scenario, they would be handed over to the court of Blackhot City for judgment .Glancing at the whip in Captain Kerlin\u2019s hand, everybody knew that someone would be ferociously whipped this time. Over the past years at school, every time the one-eyed man held a whip, some presumptuous fellow would suffer a cool public whipping.Standing in a matrix formation under the commanding platform, Zhang Tie saw the icy expression on the one-eyed man and knew what was about to happen.\u201cDo you regret it?\u201d Zhang Tie asked himself.\u201cF*ck!\u201d he answered himself.\u201cGlaze, Sharon, Garner, and Zuhair, come out of the matrix!\u201d Captain Kerlin shouted, causing the crowd to become bustling and shocked. Glaze? Glaze? Glaze\u2019s group?\u201cThis is going to be a good show!\u201d Standing next to Zhang Tie, Fatty Barley became thrilled. He touched Zhang Tie slightly with one foot.\u201cYea, we\u2019re going to see some fun! Then some fun will fall upon me!\u201d Zhang Tie thought to himself\u2026Under everyone\u2019s watch, the group of four, headed by Glaze, moved out from the formation as their faces turned pale. The first to walk out was Sharon, the one who had thrown the plates in front of Zhang Tie. At the same time, Sharon seemed to have realized something and turned back, seemingly as if he was looking for something in the matrix formation which Zhang Tie stood. His eyes were filled with a dangerous look.Zhang Tie simply looked at Sharon coldly. Even now, he did not regret what he had done earlier. For others, this decision might be difficult and painful; however, for Zhang Tie, it was an easy choice. Before he made the choice, he only asked himself one question \u2014 which choice would make my parents feel proud?In response to Captain Kerlin\u2019s call, the group of four came out from the matrix formation. The moment they stood on the platform, several law enforcement members instantly removed their leather training armor, revealing their naked upper bodies, thereby confirming everyone\u2019s previous assumption that Captain Kerlin was here to whip them.\u201cCaptain Kerlin, I believe I have the right to know the reason!\u201d Glaze growled as the veins on his forehead became pronounced when his arms were held back by the two law enforcement members.\u201cAccording to Article 27, each student should clean their dining plates and hand them over to the cafeteria after lunch. Violators of this rule will suffer 2 lashings. According to Article 6, each student should not purposely damage public properties. Violators of this rule will suffer 4 lashings. Glaze, Sharon, Garner, and Zuhair didn\u2019t hand over their dining plates to the cafeteria. They simply threw them into the small woods casually; therefore, they have violated the above two school rules, prompting my decision to give each of them 6 lashings! Am I clear?\u201d The one-eyed man coldly stared at the group of four headed by Glaze. As a result, the group of four was shocked like being struck by lightning.Standing in the matrix formation, Zhang Tie carefully observed their expressions. After Captain Kerlin finished whipping the Glaze\u2019s group, Zhang Tie realized that the three from the group of four did not stare at Sharon, but rather they glanced from time to time at the matrix formation in which Zhang Tie stood. At this moment, Zhang Tie became aware that what had happened at noon was not a coincidence; instead, it was deliberately planned by this group in an attempt to embarrass him. As they were always unruly at school and would usually find some timid fellows to wash their plates before handing them back to the cafeteria after lunch, Sharon had never expected that he would be refused this time. This explains the current situation.Once Zhang Tie came to realize this, he became depressed, as he has always tried to be low-key at school. Without knowing it, he had offended this group.Seeing the leather whip in Captain Kerlin\u2019s hand, the group of four turned pale. Seemingly as if he had something to add, Sharon said, \u201cCaptain Kerlin, I have something to say\u2026\u201dGazing at Sharon, who was swallowing his saliva, Captain Kerlin coldly muttered, \u201cGo ahead!\u201d\u201cAfter lunch, I gave our dining plates to someone else\u2026\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cIn the small woods next to the cafeteria!\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I placed them in front of the man!\u201d\u201cIn front of him? On the ground or in his hands?\u201d\u201cOn\u2026 On the ground!\u201d\u201cWhy would you place them on the ground in front of him?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I let him wash our plates before sending them back.\u201d Probably due to his lack of confidence in front of Captain Kerlin, despite his usual defiant attitude, he lowered his voice.\u201cWhat did that man say?\u201d\u201cNothing\u2026 he didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d Sharon knew that Zhang Tie was in the nearby matrix and could show up at any moment to refute his lies in public; therefore, he dared not to tell any lies.\u201cWhat happened then?\u201d\u201cThen\u2026\u201d Sharon gazed at Captain Kerlin dejectedly. \u201cThen I left\u2026\u201d\u201cI know what you\u2019re trying to say. You\u2019re trying to say that since you threw several plates in front of him and he ignored your orders to wash the plates, he should be the one to be whipped in your place? Do you feel wronged? In your eyes, since that man refused your orders, do you feel insulted? Do you feel like he should take responsibility for what happened? If you threw your plates in front of me, does that mean I would be the man who should be whipped?\u201d The one-eyed man\u2019s face was emotionless; however, his words made the look on Glaze\u2019s group worsen. They didn\u2019t speak again.\u201cWhat a good excuse! Unfortunately, you are not powerful enough to write your bastard logic into the laws and rules of Blackhot City!\u201d With a cold smile on his face, he added, \u201cTherefore, you deserve the six lashings!\u201d\u2026\u2026Afterward, all the horny students in the matrix formations began to appreciate the art of punishment by the most terrifying one-eyed man in Blackhot City. In the eyes of the students, his lashings were always the cruelest and most horrible punishment available in the Seventh National Middle School in Blackhot City. He wouldn\u2019t use too much strength until his final lashing; although it would hurt greatly, it would not wound the veins, bones, or innards. Today, all the other horny students heard 24 screams and, like eating a popsicle, felt refreshed about what had happened. Then the group of four led by Glaze was carried away from the playground by the law enforcement members of the school under the glare of the public. Unfortunately, they had passed out.\u201cThat was motherf*cking cool!\u201d After being oppressed by the group of four led by Glaze for so long, this was what all the horny undergraduates thought.Although Zhang Tie still felt pain all over, after the morning break, he gritted his teeth as he finished the afternoon training.This afternoon, there were no battle cries heard from the training ground. Compared to before, all the horny students were more lively. During the breaks, they were discussing about who was the hero. Ever since Glaze had been promoted to LV 2, he had always been unruly at school, causing nobody to dare act against him. Unexpectedly, he has encountered such an event.With the exception of Zhang Tie and Barley, every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood also became excited. Zhang Tie was thinking about how Glaze\u2019s group would take revenge for the 24 lashings they had to suffer. Those bastards would definitely take revenge more ferociously.\u201cIt looks like I won\u2019t have to worry about not having enough Iron Body Fruits later!\u201d Zhang Tie mocked himself as he thought about it helplessly.Fatty Barley was also not that excited; he had turned gloomy ever since he heard Sharon\u2019s words.Every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood knew that Zhang Tie would stay in the small woods after lunch. As Barley was good at observing others\u2019 expression, he might have already noticed something from his expression, thus Zhang Tie felt that Barley might already know that he was the supposed \u201chero\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026After school, Zhang Tie asked the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood to wait for him in the classroom for a while. He then decided to calmly declare his decision\u2026\u201cWhat\u2026 Bighead, you want to leave our Hit-Plane Brotherhood?\u201d Doug gazed at Zhang Tie in surprise. \u201cWhy? What\u2019s happening? We will help you be a real man next week!\u201dSame as Doug, Hista and Sharwin were also shocked. Bagdad was filled with anger as he clenched his fists.\u201cI might have been accustomed to be alone, so please respect my decision\u2026\u201d Forcing a smile, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t say anything as he walked out the classroom, leaving behind the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood in the classroom, who were blankly staring at each other.\u201cThis bastard, I should have punched him one more time!\u201d Bagdad fiercely punched a wall in the classroom, resulting in a few pieces of limestone falling down\u2026\u201cEven though we treated him as our good brother\u2026 Pah\u2026\u201d Doug spat towards the door. \u201cIt seems he didn\u2019t want to be our brother at all!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sharwin looked at them.\u201cHow could he be so foolish to leave our brotherhood before enjoying the coming-of-age ceremony?\u201d Hista couldn\u2019t understand.Leit rolled his eyes and stared at Barley, who was silent and had lowered his head, as he said nothing. Seeing Barley\u2019s actions, they all became silent as well. Then, Barley raised his head and glanced at them.\u201cI have already realized it back in the playground. What Bighead did has truly verified my judgment of him. You\u2019re all mistaken about him. He was leaving our brotherhood because he doesn\u2019t want to stir up trouble for us!\u201d\u201cTrouble, you mean\u2026\u201d Sharwin seemed to have realized it.\u201cBighead was that hero. He was the man who refused to wash dining plates for the Glaze\u2019s group and made them so miserable today!\u201d Barley explained all of a sudden, shocking everyone else. \u201cGlaze\u2019s group will definitely take revenge on him. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t want us to get involved, that\u2019s why he chose to leave!\u201dBarley glanced at each one of them. \u201cGlaze\u2019s group will probably take revenge on BigHead \u2014 and it will definitely be fierce! As Bighead is one of our Brotherhood, we have to suffer the revenge together with him. As this concerns our personal interests and safety, nobody could make decisions for others; therefore, I want to hear your opinions. If we treasure Bighead as our brother, we should face revenge together with him. If not, we are all safe and can just pretend that nothing has happened. We will raise our hands to make the final decision in five minutes!\u201dAt this point in time, every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood became silent\u2026\u2026Five minutes later, Barley glanced at them solemnly. \u201cThose who agree to face the revenge together with Bighead, raise your hands!\u201dThe others looked at each other and nobody spoke.\u201cWell, since you\u2019re all silent, I will be the first to decide. Although Bighead broke my nose before and got me the nickname \u2018mucus mucilage\u2019, I feel that he is righteous, that\u2019s why\u2026\u201d Doug scrunched his nose. \u201cI want to help him\u2026\u201dDoug raised up his hand\u2026\u201cIs Glaze, a LV 2 fighter, that great? I will surpass him sooner or later!\u201d Bagdad cooly raised his hand as well\u2026\u201cIf we abandoned our brother just because of such a small problem, wouldn\u2019t that mean we would disband our brotherhood in front of bigger difficulties?\u201d Hista spoke as he raised his hand.\u201cI feel like this guy always does the unexpected. I also feel like he is someone who wouldn\u2019t escape in front of a Red-scarf Burglar and would never push us into trouble, much like what he did today. He might have a solution. That\u2019s why I\u2019m relieved to have a brother like him!\u201d saying this, Leit shrugged his shoulders and raised his hands.\u201cSince all of you have decided to stand on Zhang Tie\u2019s side, there\u2019s no way I can back down now. And don\u2019t all of you feel cool today?\u201d Sharwin smiled coyly and raised up his hand as well.Just as everyone cast their eyes on the solemn looking Barley, he finally showed a brilliant smile and raised his hand. \u201cIf our brotherhood wants to get a foothold in Blackhot City, then Glaze\u2019s group will be our first milestone. If we don\u2019t face troubles together, how could we be called brothers? If we don\u2019t experience these trials together, how could we be called brothers?? Speaking of this, I really have to thank Bighead. I\u2019ve been wanting an opportunity to test our loyalty to the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, and unexpectedly, here is the opportunity!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe members stared at each other as their eyes gradually glittered. Through this difficult and unanimous choice, they all felt much closer to each other. Filled with bravery and confidence, each one of them felt warm all over their bodies\u2026\u201cWhat is the slogan of our brotherhood?\u201d seeing everybody growing more and more ambitious, Barley shouted.\u201cHit the plane!\u201d Doug exclaimed. At the same time, everybody turned and glared at him. Doug instantly felt that this joke was not appropriate and shrunk himself.\u201cOne more time, our slogan is!\u201d Barley shouted again.\u201cAnyone who gives our brothers trouble will be in trouble!\u201d the horny students growled in unison\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While you\u2019re sitting under a tree in a daze, someone suddenly throws some messy plates in front of you. As a result, you have to make a choice \u2014 being an unpaid dishwasher or being beaten to death.F*ck! The one-eyed man\u2019s words were correct: \u201cWhen faced with someone, if you refuse their request, then they would feel like you insulted them.\u201d Even now, I will insult you. Let\u2019s see whether you dare to bite me or not!The moment he went out of the school gate, Zhang Tie coincidentally encountered the one-eyed man. Naturally, as it seemed like the two had to walk on the same road for a while, he couldn\u2019t just pretend to not have seen him and pass him.\u201cCaptain Kerlin, are you going to the fighting club?\u201d Zhang Tie took the initiative and greeted him, as it was not a secret that Captain Kerlin was a part-time coach in the Iron Thorns Fighting Club.Captain Kerlin knew that Zhang Tie performed well yesterday in the Fighting Club, thus he felt that Zhang Tie was manly enough as his impression of him has begun to improve. He felt like he had made the right decision. \u201cYea, I\u2019m heading to the fighting club. I heard that you have another part-time job at the grocery store?\u201dCaptain Kerlin didn\u2019t have an inkling that Zhang Tie was that \u201chero\u201d nor was he interested. For Captain Kerlin, he believed that everyone should take care of themselves. Even now when the \u201chero\u201d dared to stir up trouble with Glaze\u2019s group, he should be brave and face it. Besides, there were so many students at school and Captain Kerlin was not their babysitter.Zhang Tie knew the temperament of the one-eyed man; therefore, he didn\u2019t mention what had happened at noon. Instead, he talked about something else with Captain Kerlin.\u201cYea, it was introduced to me by my family. I\u2019ve already worked there for a long time!\u201d\u201cHow do you feel about working over there?\u201d\u201cThe boss is kind, and I can learn a lot\u2026\u201dThey kept talking and walking in this manner\u2026When they were far away, Glaze\u2019s group appeared from behind a tree close to the school gate dejectedly. Seeing the backs of Zhang Tie and Captain Kerlin, they gritted their teeth.\u201cWhat the f*ck! That guy is walking really close with the one-eyed man. It seems that they are very close!\u201d Sharon said dejectedly. Zhang Tie grabbed Glaze\u2019s opportunity to perform in front of Miss Daina, so Glaze wanted to take revenge on him. This explains what had happened at noon. In Glaze\u2019s mind, he should be the only star in Seventh National Middle School. This was the most critical stage that determined his future, and nobody else should be able to match him. Naturally, he thought it would be easy to bully someone weaker than him. They never thought that Zhang Tie would refuse, resulting in them suffering the darkest afternoon of their lives.Hearing what Sharon said, everybody frowned. At the same time, from the fresh whip wounds on their backs came a sharp pain that was similar to rubbing salt in a wound, reminding them of the insults they had suffered.\u201cIf we deal with this guy, Captain Kerlin would definitely help him. He probably refused to listen to our orders at noon because he found someone to rely on \u2014 Captain Kerlin. We\u2019ll have to plan it well before setting him up!\u201d Garner complained loudly.\u201cOnce he leaves school, Captain Kerlin would not find any evidence. We would have more than enough time to deal with him, humph\u2026 humph\u2026\u201d Zuhair sneered.\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Sharon asked Zuhair.Zuhair looked around. The others instantly felt that the plan must be terrifying. Thus, they moved back behind the tree and listened to Zuhair\u2019s plan.\u201cIf we do this, the result would be hard to control!\u201d Zuhair looked at Glaze and waited for his final decision.\u201cWon\u2019t\u2026 this be\u2026 somewhat excessive? I just want to fiercely beat him. After all, we are\u2026 classmates\u2026 and this plan might kill him!\u201d Garner, who was obviously startled by Zuhair\u2019s scheme, staggered.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Garner, you wanna back out?\u201d Sharon stared at him coldly. \u201cHave the wounds on your back recovered so soon?\u201cGarner, you are still na\u00efve. \u2018Classmate\u2019 is worth nothing in this age!\u201d Zuhair sneered.\u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I mean\u2026\u201d Before Garner finished explaining, his neck had already been tightly gripped by one of Glaze\u2019s hand. The huge physical difference between Glaze, a LV 2 fighter, and a common student was obvious. Garner\u2019s feet were already in the air as his face gradually turned red, slowly showing a miserable expression.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to explain?\u201d Glaze sneered. Garner found it increasingly difficult to breathe as he struggled while desperately waving his hands. Glaze then loosened his hand, resulting in Garner kneeling on the ground as he coughed heavily.\u201cSo we\u2019ve made the final decision. He will have few days to show off. During the surviving training, I will give him a lesson he\u2019ll never forget\u2026\u201d Glaze showed a terrifying and cruel expression. The three people by him showed obscene smiles, either sincerely or reluctantly.So what if the result was uncontrollable? Worst case scenario, a death of a black-haired kid that nobody would care about. Deaths happened every day in Blackhot City.Zhang Tie usually called them horny students at school because he felt that everybody his age in the Seventh National Middle School were like rutting calves; however, he never thought that there were true emotionless horny students like them.\u2026\u2026When Zhang Tie entered the grocery store, he found Donder busily greeting three guests at the same time. At the sight of Zhang Tie, Donder obviously heaved a sigh of relief\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShow them our \u2018powerful rat poison\u2019\u2026\u201d Donder said to Zhang Tie\u2026Several minutes later, the three guests left. Donder then counted the gold coins with a big smile.Zhang Tie realized that the number of magistrates and soldiers on patrol neighboring the railway station has increased since the message concerning the Red-Scarf Burglars spread. Despite the news being spread, Donder\u2019s grocery store has had more guests than before \u2014 at least 20 percent more than before. Various goods, even goods used to do bad deeds, sold well. Among the bestsellers, the \u2018powerful rat poison\u2019 had the highest sales volume. It was said that the \u2018powerful rat poison\u2019 was a raw material of the most terrifying weapon. Before the Catastrophe, anybody who was close to it would endanger their lives, even if it was just within the same room. His teachers said that it was called \u201cradioactive substance\u201d before the Catastrophe. It was the Catastrophe and the mysterious particle carried by the Star of God that let the \u201cradioactive substances\u2019 lose their radioactive energy and made its basic properties change. As a result, they could no longer be used to produce the most terrifying weapons; however, its toxic property was preserved. Prior to the Catastrophe, it required people to adopt extremely sophisticated means to extract the substance, but after the Catastrophe, many people found the substance among the ores underground due to large geographic movements. The natural, virulent mineral ore was called \u201cMonster\u2019s Store\u201d and was extremely toxic after being ground into powder. In the history of the Blackson Human Clan Corridor, this \u201crat poison\u201d was used by evil organizations to instigate malicious events that led to almost ten thousand wounded or deaths. Therefore, among the official regulations in the Blackhot City, this substance was specially regulated. In fact, for professional adventurers and pioneers who were striving to explore the land and find new places for humans to live, this substance was sharp weapon against low-level magical beasts and monsters. By putting just a bit of \u201crat poison\u201d on their simple bait, it was possible to send several magical beasts to their deaths. After being simply extracted, the poison could be smeared onto weapons, making them more powerful. That was why the substance could never be completely forbidden. Although it was forbidden to sell in ordinary stores, the government of Blackhot City just kept one eye closed on it, as they could not completely forbid it.People named it as \u201crat poison\u201d so that it could be properly advertised in public. Naturally, it could be found in a grocery neighboring the railway station where passengers from all walks of life passed. Donder sold both the real \u201crat poison\u201d and the so-called \u201crat poison\u201d that could not only kill those rats at home but also kill those large, terrifying mutated rats outside the gates of the city. This substance was colorless and tasteless. Without using special means or reaching at least LV 10, a level where one would develop very sharp senses and would be able to use spiritual observation, no man or magical beast would be able to notice it. That\u2019s how terrifying this powerful \u201crat poison\u201d was.Ever since the curfew in Blackhot City had been imposed in hopes to protect its residents from the Red-Scarf Burglars, the sales as well as the price of the \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d in Donder\u2019s grocery store had increased from selling 5 to 6 vials per month at 75 silver per vial to more than 3 or 5 vials per day at 1 gold per vial. Most of the buyers were commoners. Thinking of what had happened at school today and the potential revenge, Zhang Tie became dejected\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why do you look so bad?\u201d Donder didn\u2019t lay in the lounge; instead, he moved forward and asked Zhang Tie after seeing off two batches of guests as Zhang Tie closed his account book.\u201cF*ck! Is every fatty good at observing others?\u201d Zhang Tie felt strange when he associated the Fatty Barley to the boss of the grocery store in front of him.Forcing a smile, Zhang Tie poured out what had happened at school. Soon after, he finished and felt much better.\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026\u201d Donder smiled obscenely and raised his thumb towards Zhang Tie. \u201cIt\u2019s really unimaginable that you are so tough! Do you regret it?\u201d\u201cMotherf*cker, those bastards\u2026 I would wash plates for my friends, for the roadside beggars, but I would never do it for those bastards! Let\u2019s see if they dare to bite off my d*ck if I don\u2019t do it!\u201d Being familiar with Donder, Zhang Tie felt natural to lose his temper in front of him. \u201cHave you ever met motherf*ckers like them before?\u201d Zhang Tie then asked the fatty for his suggestions and countermeasures. As Zhang Tie has already worked for him for a long time, he saw the fatty as a teacher who had taught him a lot. At the very least, Donder was much more experienced than he was.\u201cFor cases like these, everybody has the chance to encounter people like them since there are so many defiant bastards in this world. You could just be sitting there peacefully and someone else might be aggressive towards you out of the blue. They don\u2019t feel comfortable until they have fiercely kicked your face. Encountering bastards like this, you should beat them fiercely. Do you know what mistake you made this afternoon?\u201d Donder asked Zhang Tie.\u201cWhat mistake?\u201d\u201cSince you have decided to be their opponent, you should use every possible means to deal with them. Young man, you are pretending to be tough, but inside, you are soft-hearted and hesitant!\u201dHearing this, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes widened. He had set them up so ferociously, yet Donder still called him soft-hearted and hesitant.\u201cSince you\u2019ve become their opponent, you have to slap them ten times instead of once!\u201d Donder criticized Zhang Tie relentlessly. \u201cYou think those bastards would thank you for only slapping them once? If I was in your position, I would quietly throw their plates into the toilet and set them up \u2014 and I would never admit to doing so! However, you simply left their plates and did nothing. You tell me, how would that one-eyed man respond if he found those plates in the toilet? What punishment would the school give them? No matter what, they were the one who threw the plates, not you. So what are you afraid of?\u201dZhang Tie was stunned. He muttered to himself, \u201cIt seems that if I were to do what he suggested, Glaze\u2019s group would be accused of \u2018purposely stealing public property\u2019 and \u2018damaging the reputation of the school\u2019 to some degree. Even though there was no rule about \u201cdo not disgust others\u201d, nobody knew how hard the one-eyed man would whip them and how many days they would have to stay on the bed. Am I actually soft-hearted?\u201d\u201cAnd here is another mistake!\u201d Donder added.\u201cAnother one?\u201d Zhang Tie stared at Donder innocently.\u201cSince those guys have been lashed to death, their overall strength should be greatly reduced. At this moment, you should call your buddies or directly instigate people who are usually dissatisfied with Glaze\u2019s group and directly cripple them. You have to make them fear you and lose the ability to take revenge on you. Even if you crippled one of them, this disturbance would involve a large amount of people and you have yet to graduate. They were also the first to be in the wrong and had bullied so many students. That\u2019s why you would not assume all the responsibilities by yourself \u2014 many other people would defend you!\u201dZhang Tie became speechless. In front of Donder, he felt as if he was as innocent as a tiny white rabbit. The boss was so confident that one of his fingers almost poked Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead. From his excitement, Donder\u2019s saliva even flew onto Zhang Tie\u2019s face. \u201cYou should know that your third mistake is unforgivable. You shouldn\u2019t have left that Hit-Plane Brotherhood without explaining your reasoning. You idiot! Why not use your buddies? Is it that fun to cut off your protection when facing danger? Even a pig is a hundred times smarter than you. The correct solution is to tell your buddies about the conflict between you and those bastards and let them help you beat those bastards to death after school. If they don\u2019t dare to do it, it would be their fault and they would feel sorry for you in the future. However, you left without any explanation. That\u2019s why you\u2019re the one in the wrong. If they don\u2019t know the reason, they might even despise you and might even turn into your enemy\u2026\u201d Donder was so excited that he directly poked Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead with his finger. \u201cWhether your head had been kicked bad by a donkey or being squeezed by the door?\u201dHearing Donder\u2019s analysis, Zhang Tie felt like he lost face, so much so that he wanted to bury his head in his knees. Previously, Zhang Tie thought that what he had done was great and manly; however, hearing Donder\u2019s analysis, he felt that he was truly an idiot. According to Donder\u2019s suggestions, he should have united with the other horny undergraduate students who were dissatisfied with Glaze\u2019s group, surrounding those bastards with sticks and bars in hand and beating them until they beg for forgiveness. In this way, he would even be able to cripple them directly. If they were lucky, the Hit-Plane Brotherhood could recruit new members and develop quickly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I realize this?\u201d Zhang Tie felt very regretful.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCleaning the saliva on his face, Zhang Tie stared at Donder, who had cast a contemptuous look at him. Zhang Tie became blank and scratched his head. \u201cWhat should I do now?\u201d\u201cWhat should you do? You have already missed the best opportunity. When you arrive at school tomorrow, explain why you took the initiative and left the Hit-Plane Brotherhood to the members. At the very least, you should beg for forgiveness and eliminate them as a potential risk. Then it depends on your luck. Keep one rule in mind: never think that your opponent and enemy are as kind as you, and never think that they would follow those motherf*cking ethical rules like you. In this world, human beings are the most terrifying existence, and the number of people killed by humans is much more than the number killed by alien clans. You should take care of yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter if you can\u2019t beat Glaze. You should not throw an egg against a rock. If you have more friends than him, unite your friends to beat him. If you had a high social status, use your power to control him. If you are richer than him, use your money to buy him. If you are smarter than him, set him up. If you are patient enough, wait for an opportunity to attack him. If you are shameless enough, deceive him using shameless means. For instance, kneel down in front of him and wait for their punishment. Afterward, you can join your opponents, gaining their trust and favor. At the critical moment, set them up so that they no longer have any opportunities to take revenge. You should know in which aspect you are better than him. You should use your advantage to play him to death. If you cannot match him in every aspect, just stay far away from him. This is the rule in this world. Am I clear?\u201d Donder rarely had an opportunity to teach anyone; therefore, he seized this opportunity to shoot all his knowledge onto Zhang Tie\u2019s face like arrows shot from the steam-powered crossbows installed on the city walls of Blackhot City.As if meeting this vicious boss for the first time, Zhang Tie stared at Donder\u2019s expression for a long while, almost causing the fatty to be irritated. Intensely nodding, he said in a shameful way, \u201cI understand a bit!\u201d\u201cThink over it carefully. On the Oriental Continent, what I said was the essence of the Vicious Rule of Human Nature \u2014 a mysterious knowledge among the Chinese clan that is used to deal with bastards and thugs!\u201d Donder sharply winked, causing the persuasiveness of his words to weaken.The Vicious Rule of Human Nature? It only seemed like being shameless and vicious. Does this count as mysterious knowledge? Although Zhang Tie severely doubted Donder\u2019s words, he felt Donder\u2019s words were also reasonable. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll just go with the flow. In the worst case scenario, I would just be beaten a few times.\u201d Thinking of the first Leakless Fruit that would be ripe tonight, Zhang Tie\u2019s heart started to pound.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As Donder had already realized that Zhang Tie was absent-minded today, he let him go back earlier than usual. However, it really surprised him that the boy had already rushed out of the door the instant he said \u201cdinner\u201d.\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie was very excited at this moment. He couldn\u2019t wait to get back home and see what the \u201cLeakless Fruit\u201d looked like. He even forgot the soreness and pain from his body.There was only one thought in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind \u2014 returning home!\u2026\u2026As a result of the recently added midnight curfew in Blackhot City, just before midnight, the railway station would be bustling as more and more people gathered at the flea market and surrounding shops.In order to get back home as soon as possible, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t select the usual route; instead, he used a shortcut and ran into the populated alleys and streets near the railway station. Although these kinds of places had people of all walks of life and lacked security, Zhang Tie had always passed through this area for several years and found nothing strange about it in the least. However, there was always an exception. At a corner between an alley and a street, due to the darkness, Zhang Tie ran into another man who was exiting the alley. Neither of the two had expected that they would crash into someone else at this intersection.That man\u2019s body only shook a bit, while Zhang Tie bounced back and fell onto the ground. All of a sudden, Zhang Tie became dazed and made a furious harrumph.\u201cBoy, you wanna die!?\u201dZhang Tie widened his eyes and saw a tall, masculine man around the age of 40 standing in front of him. Like the average pioneer, the guy ferociously stepping towards Zhang Tie had a long, vicious face and brown hair.Zhang Tie had not yet recovered. From this fierce crash alone, he felt like his bones were almost broken and struggled greatly to get himself off the ground. Never would he have imagined that the man in front of him would be so vicious. After having seen Zhang Tie fall onto the ground, the man had actually wanted to step on him. Seeing the man\u2019s large feet and muscles, Zhang Tie realized that he would be severely wounded if not killed under his feet.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Huck?\u201d From the alley behind the manly fellow came a thin shadow wearing a pioneer uniform. Seeing what Huck was about to do, the man instantly stopped him as he slightly raised his chin towards a certain direction. Following the direction of his chin, Huck saw a team of patrolling soldiers in a street far away. Seeing the patrolling soldiers, Huck stopped.\u201cYoung man, are you ok?\u201d The thin yet tall man moved from behind Huck and squatted in front of Zhang Tie with a smile. Looking into the man\u2019s slim eyes with yellowish pupils, Zhang Tie felt like he was being stared at by a cobra. At that instant, Zhang Tie felt the hair on his body standing on its end. The instant that man drew close to him like a snake, Zhang Tie smelt a fishy scent, which made him feel like vomiting.Thinking of how Huck had raised his foot, Zhang Tie hurriedly picked himself up. No matter what, it was too dangerous for him to remain lying on the ground.\u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine. I was running just now. Sorry about that\u2026\u201d\u201cHoho, you\u2019re so careless. Are you hurt? Come on, let me give you a hand!\u201d\u201cNo need\u2026 thanks\u2026\u201d Seeing the man stretching out his hand toward him, Zhang Tie hurriedly sat up.\u201cCome on, I mean it. To tell you the truth, we didn\u2019t notice you either\u2026\u201d The thin guy smiled, instantly grabbing Zhang Tie\u2019s hands as he intended to pull him up. Feeling the tight grip on his wrists, Zhang Tie did not have the time to say anything before he felt as if his hands were licked by a snake. Following that, he felt as if the man had searched every part of his body; from the palms, wrists, and elbows to his shoulders, armpits, waist, chest, and belly. Finally, he even searched Zhang Tie\u2019s crotch, shanks, and ankles as he pretended to pat off dirt for him. All this happened before Zhang Tie had a chance to realize what was happening. The thin man then shook his head towards Huck.\u201cSince it\u2019s evening, take care on your way back!\u201d The thin man forced a weird smile at Zhang Tie as he left with the ferociously staring Huck. Soon after, they disappeared in the populated street.In just a few seconds, Zhang Tie realized that his back had already been drenched with sweat. When the night wind blew, he shivered. Instinctively, Zhang Tie realized that he seemed to have just escaped a huge crisis.Zhang Tie quickly left. \u201cGod bless me. I don\u2019t want to ever meet those two terrifying guys again!\u201d Zhang Tie muttered to himself as he moved forward. Several steps later, he felt something beneath his foot. With widened eyes, he bent down and picked up the item. Under the moonlight, Zhang Tie saw a palm-sized cloth bag that contained something within. It felt neither like a rare metal nor money. Being surprised, Zhang Tie took the object out of the bag, revealing a dark red triangular wooden plate that had cracks at its center. There was nothing on the wooden plate \u2014 no patterns or characters. It seemed to have been made of common red pine, which was not very expensive. The moment Zhang Tie intended to throw it away, he noticed that the wooden plate was very smooth as if the plate was regularly used and handled by people. Zhang Tie then became curious as to why a useless plate would be held so solemnly inside this bag. Realizing that Huck had dropped the bag, Zhang Tie smirked as he placed it back within cloth bag before foisting the bag into his pocket. He then rushed home.Half an hour after Zhang Tie left, the two men returned. Unlike before, their faces had turned pale with an indescribable fear. With oil lamps in hand, they lowered their bodies onto the ground and searched almost every corner on this patch of land. Unfortunately, they had failed to find what they were looking for.\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d At this moment, Huck did not look vicious; the only thing that could be seen on his face was an uncertainty that would be seen during the end of the world \u201cSnade, why not go directly to them?\u201d\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d The snake-like man called Snade stared at Huck. \u201cYou know the rules of our organization! You know what they would do if they don\u2019t see the token! Without the token, we would be killed the instant we told them who we are!\u201d\u201cWhat should we do If we can\u2019t finish this task?\u201dRemembering what their leaders had done to the followers who made mistakes, Huck and Snade turned utterly pale.\u201cIt must have been that kid. It\u2019s really unbelievable that we lost the token. You had checked it when we left the railway station. Additionally, we did not come into contact with anyone else. The token must have been stolen by that kid!\u201d Snade concluded ferociously.\u201cBut you had checked him just now and found nothing at all!\u201d\u201cThat kid is definitely experienced. He must have thrown it away when he got our token. It was too dark just now and we didn\u2019t pay attention to our feet. After we left, that kid probably picked it up and ran away!\u201d Besides mistaking Zhang Tie as an experienced thief who lurked near the railway station, his judgment was completely correct. \u201cNow, we can only hope that he didn\u2019t throw it away. Otherwise\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOtherwise, I will definitely kill all his family members and chop him into meat paste!\u201d Huck\u2019s fat face trembled. \u201cWhat should we do now? Should we go look for him?\u201d\u201cNo, we should go get another thief and let him lead us to that kid. If that kid frequents the area near the railway station, other people must know him!\u201d\u201cFine\u2026\u201dWithin Blackhot City, the neighborhood near the railway station was the most disorderly place. There were many criminals here who did bad deeds such as pickpocket, robbery, rape, etc. Those guys cooperated with the magistrates near the railway station stealthily. They were definitely an evil force in the Blackhot city. However, that night, the two more sinister men would finally deal with them tonight due to a \u201ctrivial\u201d matter\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When the two were searching the ground, Zhang Tie had already returned home.As there was one more person at home as well as the baby that would be born in about ten months, Zhang Tie\u2019s parents haven\u2019t been going out in the evening for the past few days; instead, they stayed at home. Recently, supper has been more nutritious than before. Zhang Tie could tell that some dishes, which tasted really good, were made by his soon-to-be sister-in-law.When he returned, Zhang Tie only found his mom and his soon-to-be sister-in-law at home. After he had finished supper, he saw his dad return covered in sweat while carrying ham on his back. Zhang Tie then knew where his dad had been.Together with his dad, Zhang Tie dealt with the approximately 20 kg ham and hung it in the kitchen. As he had not smelled this kind of scent in a long time, Zhang Tie strongly inhaled. After having done so, Zhang Tie joked, \u201cDad, you and mom really play favorites. I\u2019ve been wanting ham since a long time ago, yet you didn\u2019t buy any for me; however, as soon as my sister-in-law arrived, you bought it so soon. Your son really can not match your grandson!\u201d\u201cNo crap!\u201d His dad poked his face with a finger. \u201cIf you\u2019re a man, you shouldn\u2019t eat it even after your mom has prepared it!\u201d\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie smiled but muttered within his heart, \u201cYour son really did something amazing at school today.\u201d However, Zhang Tie knew that what had happened at school would only make his dad and mom worried; therefore, he decided he would not tell them about it. \u201cDad, how much was the ham?\u201d\u201c58 silver coins and 60 copper coins \u2014 almost 60 silver coins!\u201d His dad complained bitterly, \u201cIt was never this expensive before!\u201dZhang Tie was startled. This price was almost equivalent to one month of his dad\u2019s salary. It seemed that his dad and mom had paid a steep price for their grandson. Seeing his dad being gloomy over there, Zhang Tie moved close to him and prattled, \u201cRemember to buy more fruits to provide enough nutrition for the health of the future baby of our Zhang family!\u201d\u201cYea, your mom also\u2026\u201d His dad suddenly realized that he had already fallen into Zhang Tie\u2019s trap. Being irritated, his dad chased him around the room and flicked at Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead.\u2026\u2026Ever since his sister-in-law came to their home, Zhang Tie realized that his plan to earn merit value at home became ineffective. Every place in the house became clean and tidy, thus he could not even find an excuse to do housework anymore. As a result, Zhang Tie had nothing to do and could only smile bitterly. It seemed that he had to find another hidden way to earn merit value.After supper, his mom and sister-in-law sat close and were knitting. As she had grown up in the house of a tailor, his sister-in-law was definitely good at needlework. Seeing that pair of delicate hands, Zhang Tie\u2019s mom smiled. While helping them cut rags to create insoles, Zhang Tie casually talked to them.\u201cThere are only a few days left before I will leave home,\u201d while cutting the rags, Zhang Tie thought to himself. He only had a few days to accompany his parents in these months. According to the <eldest>and the <urban>in Blackhot City and the entire Andaman Alliance, the house which was acquired through dozens of years of hard work would be inherited by his elder brother. As Zhang Tie was the youngest son, he had to leave both the house and the city and survive outside.</urban></eldest>When a young wolf grew up, it had to leave his parents\u2019 lair. If a young eagle was fully grown, then it would have to leave the eagle nest on the cliff, flying into the sky as it strove to survive even in the heavy wind and rain. Even if it was an ant, the moment it could fly, it would have to leave its nest for the future of its descendants. In this age, similar to other living species, human beings had also formulated rules and laws to manage themselves. They started to learn from the animals and species that have shown strong surviving capabilities. The two above Acts were prime examples of what humans had to do if they wanted to survive in this age. They had to move out of the high city walls. With ambition and swords, they had to be brave as they explore the land in search for new places for humans to live. They had to fight alien clans and eliminate the dangerous species as they gradually establish new cities and human settlements that could contain more people. This was the rule of survival in this age; it had nothing to do with morality. In reality, this was what the human race needed to survive.The cities were safe; however, a city could only contain a limited population, thus not everybody could live in Blackhot City. Using Zhang Tie\u2019s family, which had two sons, as an example, when Zhang Tie, the youngest son, completes his compulsory education and begins to serve in the army, the <eldest>and the <urban>would spring into effect. As his elder brother was going to get married and Zhang Tie would soon enter society, it would not be convenient for him to stay at home, thus there were only a few days left before he would leave.</urban></eldest>Over the past few days, Zhang Tie has tried to stay away from this topic. He tried his best to stay as close as he could with his parents and always made jokes to make them happy in hopes to lower the sadness they would feel from the eventual departure. His parents had also tried to avoid this topic. As the two months of outdoor survival training was soon, Zhang Tie knew that other families had already prepared equipment and food for their children.Without knowing it, Zhang Tie felt the flow of time flew by quickly when he stayed with his parents. The pile of rags was soon finished being cut into pieces. It was currently a bit late, and his mom looked a bit tired. After chatting for awhile, Zhang Tie found an excuse to leave. While yawning, he washed his feet, brushed his teeth, and returned to the attic.Back in his room, Zhang Tie looked over the triangular wooden plate carefully and finally confirmed that it was made of red pine and had no miraculous or hidden functions. Aside from the special, naturally formed grains on it, there was nothing else worth mentioning about it. If it was placed among kids\u2019 toys, others would simply take it as a building block.Whenever Zhang Tie thought back to Huck\u2019s pair of large feet and the snake-like, slim man who searched him all over, he would feel goosebumps all over.\u201cMotherf*cker, two perverts! Haven\u2019t you lived a good childhood? You two play this motherf*cking thing at that age!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed. Throwing the wooden plate directly into the cloth bag, he then tossed it into the sundry box at the corner of the room.After having thrown the wooden plate, Zhang Tie sucked in a deep breath and closed his eyes. He was soon able to find the miraculous, arched gate between his brows. Locking onto it, he muttered to himself, \u201cEnter!\u201d\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!\u201cIt feels really motherf*cking good!\u201d Inside the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie sucked in a deep breath. Whenever he entered, he would be curious. Despite there only being a few sprouted plants with low aura value, whenever he entered here, he would feel vigorous. Even the air inside was much fresher than that of Blackhot City.As usual, Zhang Tie checked the basic attributes inside the Castle of Black Iron first.\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura value: 23.5\u2014\u2014Merit value: 56\u2014\u2014Basic energy storage: 0.5Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014Special output: voidThere was nothing special about this basic data; the aura value was still increasing due to the growing plants, and merit value did not increase today, as he had neither cleaned the desks and chairs at school nor did he do housework at home.Closing the basic attributes window, he checked his reclaimed land. The potatoes were growing quite well, and all the niblets had already sprouted and had broken out of the ground. The sprouted potato twigs had already started to bifurcate with the longest having reached a length of almost 10 cm. In contrast, the potato in the \u201cNo.1 pit\u201d which he had injected three merit value points for mutation and evolution was not different than before. Zhang Tie assumed that the result of the mutation and evolution might be related to the growth cycle of the species. As only a week had elapsed since he had injected the points, it was reasonable to see no change.After checking his reclaimed land; Zhang Tie arrived at the small tree once again. Gazing at the Leakless Fruit, he thought back to its growth process. From the size of a grape, it grew to the size of an egg. From dark cyan, it changed to a dark red. Zhang Tie drooled immensely and knew that only four hours were left before it became ripe. Zhang Tie was so excited that he even scratched his face. He then forced himself to calm down next to the tree for a while. With eyes firmly fixed on the Leakless Fruit, he simply squatted by the tree until his legs became gradually numb. Picking himself up from the ground, he started to circle around the tree. During this process, he couldn\u2019t help but glance several times at the time remaining before it became ripe. Unexpectedly, there was still four hours left\u2026When Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but check it again, he suddenly realized. \u201cZhang Tie! Zhang Tie! You are really this impatient! How could an impatient man like you match Miss Daina in the future? One ear of wheat would grow ripe and dry within one year; a diamond would form into being after hundreds of millions of years; a bean sprout will grow up in water in two days. However, I heard it took God ten thousand years to create the Olive Tree \u2014 the king of trees! All wheat straws would be burned into ashes; all bean sprouts would turn into the wastes of human beings and animals. However, a diamond would become a piece of jewelry, and the Olive Tree would become a holy symbol. This explained the difference between patience and impatience. In which way should I live for the rest of my life? As a wheat straw, a bean sprout, a diamond, or an Olive Tree?\u201d he muttered to himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Sucking in a deep breath, he gave a final glance at the small tree. Zhang Tie locked onto the miraculous arched door in his mind and left the Castle of Black Iron\u2026Zhang Tie never knew that this small, patient choice of his had made him more mentally mature.After returning to his small room, Zhang Tie stood there for a while. Sitting on the bed, he started to practice <mental>. Afterward, Zhang Tie took out the crystal which had been buried in the crystal sand by the windowsill and started to polish the Shrine burning point. When his spiritual energy was almost exhausted, Zhang Tie visualized the contents of the book, <mental>, once again. Realizing that there was still more than one hour before the Leakless Fruit became ripe, Zhang Tie resisted his impulses to reenter the Castle of Black Iron and fell asleep.</mental></mental>When he woke up from his sweet dream due to needing to use the washroom, it was already past midnight.With the moonlight shining through the window, Zhang Tie had a look at the clock and found it was almost 4:00 am. 2 hours had already passed since the first Leakless Fruit became ripe.Zhang Tie instantly sprung up from his bed barefoot, wearing only a pair of underwear. He then rapidly locked onto the miraculous arched door in his consciousness and disappeared from the room\u2026After returning to the Castle of Black Iron a few hours since he was last here, the first thing Zhang Tie did wasn\u2019t running toward the small tree to pick the fruit; instead, he pulled off his underwear, got out his p*nis, and cooly urinated in the direction opposite of the tree about 10 m away. After the pressure on his bladder had been relieved, Zhang Tie trembled from the comfort. Pulling up his underwear, he moved to the small tree. 4 or 5 meters away from the small tree, Zhang Tie smelt a special fragrance that made people feel spirited. It was the fragrance of a ripe fruit that also smelt like the fragrance given off by sandalwood. It was too mysterious to be described. Zhang Tie was completely intoxicated and sucked in deep breaths as his eyes locked onto the ripe Leakless Fruit.Compared to several hours ago, it was completely different. Previously, it was as large as an egg and was dark red in color, but currently, it has a glossy surface and was somewhat translucent. The insides of the fruit loomed a wisp of gold.\u201cGulu\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but swallow his saliva. Dragging his feet, he stretched out his hand toward the ripe Leakless Fruit.\u2014\u2014Leakless Fruit has become ripe. Usage: Pick and directly eat it. Notice: The fruit cannot be taken out of the Castle of Black Iron. After twelve hours of having been picked off the tree, its energy and vitality will gradually decline.A semi-translucent dialogue box then appeared automatically to warn Zhang Tie.Seeing the dialogue box gradually disappear in front him, Zhang Tie\u2019s chest rose and fell. He sucked in two deep breaths and looked decisive as he picked the fruit without any hesitation as if he were picking a peach. Moving it close to his nose, he smelled the fruit before carefully staring at it. Finally, he raised his head, opened his mouth widely, and took a large bite.The instant his teeth broke into the marvelous fruit, Zhang\u2019s mouth was filled with the rich fragrance of the fruit. It was delicious! At that moment, all of Zhang Tie\u2019s pores expanded comfortably.With the sound of 'siliu\u201d, Zhang Tie swallowed the juice of the first bite. The first bite had only bitten off a small part of the fruit. Soon, he gave a few more bites, finishing the fruit very quickly. Judging from its texture and taste, Zhang Tie swore that he had never eaten such a delicious fruit before.After he finished the fruit, Zhang Tie licked his lips for the juice that remained on his lips as he slowly savored its taste while questioning what sorts of effects it would bring. Before he was even able to taste the aftertaste, the effects of the fruit had already spread all over his chest and bellyA warm Qi started to rise from between Zhang Tie\u2019s chest and belly, almost causing him to groan. This wisp of warm Qi turned into a warm wave as it started to rotate between Zhang Tie\u2019s chest and belly. In less than two cycles, the warm wave abruptly moved back and charged towards the Shrine burning point as if it were a boa chasing its prey. Feeling the surging wave, Zhang Tie\u2019s face twisted. He directly sat on the ground and crossed his legs. In response to the Qi, Zhang Tie instantly entered meditation\u2026At that moment, an unexpected change happened at the Shrine burning point over the navel. That powerful, warm wave was swirling around his Shrine burning point like a fire dragon drilling into its own cave. As a result, the Shrine burning point, which was like a cave, was slowly absorbing the wisps of warm energy from the fire dragon, resulting in the \u201centrance of the cave\u201d slowly expanding from the wisps of warm energy so that the fire dragon could drill inside. As the cave gradually enlarged, more and more energy was absorbed and the insides of the cave became brighter and brighter. At the same time, the fire dragon began to fly around the cave faster and faster.More than ten minutes later, with the sound of a \u201cBoom!\u201d, the cyan cave entrance directly expanded greatly as the cyan luster gradually turned to blue. However, the entrance with blue luster was still too small to allow that fire dragon in. Hence, the fire dragon continued to swirl around the entrance as it constantly injected warm energy into the cave. After around another ten minutes, the blue luster over the entrance grew brighter and brighter. With another \u201cBoom!\u201d, the blue light turned purple as the entrance enlarged once more. In response to this, the fire dragon became more lively. The warm Qi rising between Zhang Tie\u2019s chest and belly continually converted into warm waves that supported the arrogant fire dragon while all the warm waves were injected into the wider and brighter cave entrance. About half an hour later, the entrance radiating purple light was large enough to hold the fire dragon. All of a sudden, that fire dragon threw itself into that entrance without any hesitation\u2026 \u201cBoom!\u201d With another huge sound, the long fire dragon completely hid itself in the cave. Radiating dazzling light, a purple luster radiated in all directions in the form of light fragments. At the place where the fire dragon and the entrance disappeared, a red sparkle appeared in its place, slowly burning as it grew into a fierce flame in the darkness. It continuously radiated heat and light to the surrounding coldness and darkness.When he clearly 'saw\u201d a flame over the Shrine burning point, Zhang Tie cried out and burst into tears before laughing out loudly like a lunatic. Unexpectedly, he had ignited the Shrine burning point today in such manner. The effects of the Leakless Fruit were really surprising \u2014 it easily allowed him to break through the three levels of cyan, blue, and purple and directly allowed him to surge from an ordinary soldier to a LV 1 fighter.\u201cIs the Leakless Fruit used to ignite burning points?\u201d Such a question flashed in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind. Feeling weird, he picked himself up to the feet.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe felt empty inside, as if he didn\u2019t have any organs, skeleton, or muscles. Right then, he felt a warm spring wind blow from the Shrine burning point in all directions and made him feel invigorated all over. His elder brother had told him that the ignition of each burning point in one\u2019s body was a process to rebuild and enhance one\u2019s physique. The feeling was very special, as it would either feel extremely comfortable or extremely painful. Besides the feeling of comfort or pain, there were also many other strange feelings. His elder brother had said that after some burning points were ignited, it felt even more comfortable than the climax of making love. In contrast, the ignition of some other burning points would even feel as painful as giving birth to a baby or like the feeling of metamorphosing from a cocoon to a butterfly.The warm breeze from the Shrine burning point stopped after seven or eight minutes. For over a minute, Zhang Tie could hear cracking sounds from within his body. This was a process known as \u201cSkeleton Rearrangement\u201d that everybody who had ignited the Shrine burning point would enjoy. The entire process was really pleasant and felt like the body was being rearranged by an invisible hand. Zhang Tie felt like a machine being commissioned by an expert. Afterward, he felt that all the bones in his body fit well with each other. Additionally, the feeling of being full of vitality and the unprecedented sense of harmony made him so excited that he even wanted to loudly shout out.In this age, only after having reached this level could you step onto the road of cultivation.\u201cMiss Daina, here I am. I\u2019ve already ignited the Shrine burning point. Ah\u2026\u201dZhang Tie exclaimed towards the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ever since the curfew was imposed, every night after midnight, the entire Blackhot City would fall asleep like a giant that they had finished their day of busy work.Like birds singing in the daytime and the snakes chasing after mice in the night, some preferred to wander about in the night rather than the day, especially those from the areas neighboring the railway station where people of all walks of life converged. After midnight, there would still be many people wandering outside. Unfortunately, if they were captured by the patrolling City Guard Army and the magistrates, they would be punished through lashings, would have to serve in Glanceburg Prison that was located outside Blackhot City, and would become a joke to many pioneers. However, for those pioneers, this punishment was nothing serious at all.Many people held this thought, hence why the bar in an alley near the railway station filled with pioneers, the \u201cTreasures of the Poisonous Snakes\u201d, was extremely bustling after midnight. For the average adolescent like Zhang Tie, they would never know of the wonderful nightlife that Blackhot City had.As for the new arrivers, Huck and Snade, they had investigated the areas near the railway station before finding the bar called \u201cTreasures of the Poisonous Snakes\u201d. After 00:00 when the curfew came into effect, the two entered the bar as they pushed open the two doors.The bar was not spacious inside. After midnight, the bar was boisterous, as there were around 30 people inside, most of whom were wearing the uniform of pioneers. Some talked and laughed loudly as they touched the breasts of the prostitutes beside them. Some murmured in the shadows of lights in the bar, where one would occasionally see two men scratching something hidden within their broad sleeves at the table. Some nodded when they were satisfied, while others shook their heads to show disagreement. If they could not reach an agreement, they would pull back their hands. This was the usual trading pattern among pioneers. The transaction was done within their sleeves to keep the items and prices of the trade a secret. Only the two parties involved knew what had happened, thus one would never know the topic of their conversation, even if they were planning your assassination and its price.When Huck and Snade entered the bar, many people glanced at them and continued their own business, while other more perceptive pioneers felt as if danger was drawing close to them. In response, they stealthily moved the weapons lying on the table or beside them closer, placing them in a convenient position in case a critical situation arises.The moment Huck and Snade sat at a table, two slightly nice-looking barmaids had already moved in front of them with slim twisting waists. They intended to lower their bodies to show their exposed, plump breasts. \u201cHandsome boys, what can I do for you?\u201d\u201cTwo cups of black pine wine. What kind of food do you serve?\u201d asked Snade.\u201cToast, soybean, beef soup, and crispy sausage!\u201d\u201cOne set for each of us!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201dAfter the barmaids left, noticing what the two had ordered, the others moved their gazes away from them, as they knew few troublemakers would enjoy a meal before causing trouble in the bar.Soon, the food ordered by Snade and Huck were served. Looking at the food, Snade didn\u2019t eat it immediately; instead, he took out a grass root, which looked like a dried twig, wrapped in silver wires and poked every item on their plates and the mug of beer as he checked for a change in the color of the grass root and the silver wires. After no color change was seen, they started to safely enjoy the supper. After several hours of work, the two were currently really hungry.It was common for pioneers to test for poison by using the grass root of a Soul-Eating Thorn that was wrapped in silver wires. Silver wire and the grass root of the Soul-Eating Thorn was the perfect combination \u2014 it reacts to most poisonous substances, including the \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d that only required a small amount to kill a fully grown man. Almost every pioneer had this habit of testing their food for poison before eating, hence others did not find it strange when they saw this. Even the boss and barmaids considered this as a common habit among pioneers. Aside from frequent customers, many new arrivers of this bar, which was teemed with pioneers, would test poison like those two. It was just a living habit.The guests of the bar were loudly talking about the town hall of the Blackhot City. The town hall had increased the payment for mapping the black areas north and west of Blackhot City, rising to a price of 46 gold coins per squared kilometers of black area. Additionally, for every extra square kilometer, the price would increase by 5%. Over the past few days, several waves of pioneers who considered themselves exceptional had already traveled over there in groups; however, it was unknown how many among them would return.After finishing their meal, Huck and Snade pretended to listen to the news inside the bar before preparing to leave and called the barmaid to settle the bill. Intending to pull out his purse, Huck\u2019s purse suddenly dropped onto the ground, causing two gold coins to roll out of his purse. Huck hurriedly put away the purse. Instead, Snade settled the bill before the two walked out of the bar. Soon after they left, a man in a corner of the bar also picked himself up on his feet. Drinking the last of his beer, he purposely spilled some beer on himself. Afterwards, he followed the two and left the bar.The actions of the man surprised no one in the bar.\u201cIt seems like Squirrel Pond has finally found tonight\u2019s prey. Heh\u2026 Heh\u2026\u201d Someone inside the bar started to smirk. Everyone forgot about the three who had just left. In this world, each and every one of them had their own set of survival rules. If others didn\u2019t affect them, then most would just choose to ignore what was happening beside them. This was one of the rules of survival in this age.The moment Squirrel Pond teetered out of the bar, he looked around and saw Huck and Snade walking into an alley on the left. Narrowing his eyes, he continued to follow them as he pretended to be a drunk man. When Pond drew close to them, the two walking in front glanced back at him; however, they seemed to not care when they saw the drunk man. Drawing close to Huck, he tumbled forward as he moved his hand inside of Huck\u2019s coat. The instant Pond\u2019s fingers touched Huck\u2019s clothes, he heard a cold sneer.\u201cToo slow!\u201dBefore Squirrel Pond realized what had happened, his hand was already firmly gripped by Huck. The moment he was about to pretend to be a drunkard and shout loudly, an ice dagger had already arrived at his neck. The dagger cut into the skin and left a shallow cut. Pond was really scared and began to sweat. Afterwards, as if treating a chick, Huck covered his mouth before carrying Pond into a shadow beside the alley, a place where nobody would see.\u201cTake us to see your boss. We want to see him!\u201d Huck, the manly guy, seemed to be not that patient as he threw Pond directly onto the ground and spoke in a straightforward manner.\u201cI don\u2019t know what are you talking about! I am\u2026 ah\u2026\u201d With his mouth covered, Pond couldn\u2019t make a sound. Feeling a cold sensation on his right hand, he lowered his head and saw what had happened to hand. What he found was the main artery on his right wrist had been slit open, causing his blood to pour out like a fountain. The wound looked like a mouth of a beast and had almost scared Pond to death.\u201cYou have less than ten minutes before your run out of blood!\u201d Snade smirked at Pond while playing with his dagger.\u201cOur boss is Bres, a LV 6 Black Spider. Besides him, we have more than ten brothers. If you dare to offend us, you will regret it\u2026\u201d Pond shouted loudly. However, he didn\u2019t notice the look of disdain on Huck\u2019s face.\u201cProbably, but you only have two choices now \u2014 wait here for your death or lead us to your boss who can save you\u2026\u201d Snade casually explained.\u2026\u2026Half an hour later in the gang\u2019s base near the railway station of the Blackhot City, Huck and Snade were surrounded by more than ten gang members with weapons in hand. The battle Qi of Bres was tumbling as the hazy shadow of a two-meter tall black spider stood behind him. Excited, every member of the gang looked at Bres with admiration, including Pond, who was under the foot of Huck and was pinching the artery that had been slit on his right hand. A LV 6 fighter who had condensed battle Qi was powerful enough to lead the gang members and allow them to have a good life near the railway station of Blackhot City. He was powerful enough to tear apart anyone who dared to challenge the gang.\u201cWhat will we do?\u201d Huck asked Snade.\u201cYou two, I\u2019ve told you that our gang doesn\u2019t have that black-haired kid nor is there such a pickpocket near the railway station. However, since you have wounded our member, you should consider how you\u2019re going to explain this to us! It\u2019s too late to regret now!\u201d Bres smirked. Waving his hand, a group of gang fighters drew close to Huck and Snade with vicious expressions.\u201cKill them all. Since they\u2019ve seen us, it would be troublesome if any one of them escaped!\u201d Snade said.Hearing this, Bres roared furiously and shot towards Huck\u2019s head. At the same time, all the other members jumped on Huck and Snade with their weapons.Huck then directly stepped on Pond\u2019s head, breaking it like a watermelon. He then punched towards Bres\u2019 fist. The moment Bres touched Huck\u2019s fist, his face turned pale as he saw a huge shadow appeared immediately behind Huck. Different from his black spider, the shadow behind Huck was a huge centipede with numerous legs.\u201cOne-thousand legged centipede \u2014 LV 7 fighter! That\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d Bres exclaimed in fright. The moment the two fists collided, Bres\u2019s entire arm was fully broken. Huck\u2019s fist then broke through Bres\u2019 chest and exited from his back.With only a single move, the pillar of the gang had suddenly collapsed. The members of the gang didn\u2019t even respond to what had happened. When they realized what had happened, they immediately threw away their weapons and escaped towards the gate.Snade avoided the incoming weapons by twisting his body like a snake and instantly appeared behind the two escaping gang members. He gently slit his dagger through their necks like a poisonous snake spitting his tongue. Before the two fell down, Snade had already appeared beside several other gang members and had slit their necks almost at the same time. After several flashes, starting from the ones who had attacked Snade first, every one of the members, including the ones who were the furthest away from Snade at distance of seven steps, stood still as they started to spray blood from their necks as if they were fountains. Then, they almost all fell down at the same time.All of this took less than five breaths. The only things that remained were the two who stood in the courtyard and the blood stench that started to spread.\u201cHow do we deal with these bodies?\u201d Huck asked Snade as if killing a large amount of people was just a trivial matter.At this moment, Snade was immersed in licking the blood on his dagger. \u201cLet\u2019s deal with bodies now. We have to make sure that nobody finds them for at least two days!\u201d\u201cWhy not burn them right away?\u201d\u201cThose people in that bar saw us tonight. Unless we kill them all tonight, people from the bar would definitely think that we are related to this incident. However, if we set a fire here two days later, nobody would think that way!\u201d Snade explained in a cautious and experienced way.\u201cAs they always appeared close to the railway station, they must have plundered a lot of things and collected them here. Let\u2019s search for them. We may get some good things if we are lucky. As for that black-haired kid that dared to run in the street neighboring the railway station, he must be very familiar with this place and always frequents here. We\u2019d better stay nearby the railway station for the next couple of days and capture him when we see him!\u201d\u201cWhat if we can\u2019t find him?\u201d\u201cIf we can\u2019t find him within one week, we\u2019d better escape from the Andaman Alliance as well as from the Blackson Human Clan Corridor as far as possible. We\u2019d better not be found by the heads of our organization; otherwise, we would die miserably!\u201d Snade said calmly.\u201cFine!\u201d\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOne hour later, Huck and Snade left the base of the gang and had even locked it from the outside, fabricating the image that nobody was inside. They believed that nobody would dare to break inside within a short period considering the terrifying power of the gang. Two days later, they could absolutely eliminate them all simply through fire, leaving no evidence. Nobody would expect that the gang had already been killed two days before the fire.\u201cA gang? Is that worth something?\u201d When they left the base of the gang, Huck spat towards it.\u2026\u2026During that period when the gang was wiped out, Zhang Tie was igniting his Shrine burning point. He didn\u2019t realize that he had been involved in such a huge crisis over such an ordinary wooden plate.Zhang Tie only felt that his whole life was filled with hope and he would have a bright future\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

No matter how hard he worked, he felt as if he was just a small tree leaf that fell into the torrent, unable to control the direction of his life. He felt powerless and unable to change anything in this age. He couldn\u2019t make Miss Daina fall in love with him and neither could he stop his parents from feeling miserable over their deceased eldest son. Sometimes, he would even think of terrible scenes related to the people he was closest to. In those scenes, he was also powerless; he had no other choice but to struggle in vain, unable to even shout.That night, Zhang Tie slept very well. It was almost the sweetest sleep he has ever had. The Leakless Fruit did not only ignite Zhang Tie\u2019s Shrine burning point, but it had also ignited Zhang Tie\u2019s hope for a better life.As usual, a bit after 6:00 am, Zhang Tie\u2019s biological clock woke him up. Opening his eyes, Zhang Tie stared at the spinous roof and felt unprecedentedly alive. Probably from one of the benefits of having ignited his Shrine burning point yesterday, he felt much better today, contrasting greatly from the soreness and pain he felt all over his body the day before. Besides one or two places on his body that were still sore, Zhang Tie had basically already recovered.I am now a LV 1 fighter! Zhang Tie mumbled to the mirror in his room as he smiled at it. By then, Zhang Tie instantly felt energetic. He made some fighting gestures and felt much stronger than before. This feeling was really cool.Quickly putting on his clothes, he rushed downstairs to wash his face and brush his teeth. He then started a fire to make breakfast for the whole family. Before his mom woke up, Zhang Tie had already gained a point of merit value and had already wolfed down some porridge. Seeing his mom walking out of her bedroom with sleepy eyes, Zhang Tie rushed forward and kissed her on her face. \u201cMom, I\u2019m heading for school\u2026\u201d He then ran out extremely quickly, leaving his mom staring in a daze at home. \u201cWhat\u2019s making him so excited?\u201dAfter igniting his Shrine burning point, on his way from home to school, Zhang Tie could feel an obvious improvement to his physique. In the past, it would take him almost 40 minutes by foot to get to school from his house. Surprisingly, it only took him slightly more than 10 minutes this time. Although he was somewhat tired, he also felt much better at the same time.As expected, Zhang Tie was naturally the earliest one to arrive from his grade once again. Checking the neighboring classrooms to ensure that there was no one waiting in ambush first, he then started to clean all the desks and chairs in his classroom to earn another 3 points of merit value. Afterwards, he ran outside the classroom and entered the washroom. He then wandered around the training ground and the small woods for a while before slowly returning to his classroom while humming a song.Naturally, when those horny students found that their desks and chairs had been cleaned again, they began to discuss about it once more. It was almost described as a supernatural event. Hearing their discussions, Zhang Tie started to carefully consider different ways to discreetly earn merit value in the future. This method would not work again. He had to find another way to earn merit value in public places. Zhang Tie started to think about the tips on merit value in the Castle of Black Iron.Do good deeds and eliminate evil\u2014\u2014the largest mercy in the Human World;Worship the gods and love the people\u2014\u2014the nearest stairway to heaven;Lucky people, please show the mercy of the creator to the secular world, so that the gods understand you;Please receive the most sincere pleasures and appreciation presented to you by the hundreds of millions of living beings;Just as ideas began to emerge within his mind, Barley walked up to him.Seeing Barley, Zhang Tie faintly felt that what he did to the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood yesterday was really motherf*cking foolish. As Donder had told him, if he was just vicious and decisive enough, he would see a completely different result.Before Zhang Tie greeted this fatty, the fatty had already cracked a big smile and walked right in front of Zhang Tie. Lowering his body, he muttered to Zhang Tie lightly, \u201cWe brotherhood members have something to talk to you about after class!\u201dAfter Barley, all the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, including Bagdad, Doug, Hista, Sharwin, and Leit, arrived. Surprisingly, these guys looked friendlier than usual. Grinning as they exposed their front teeth, they smiled innocently at Zhang Tie, making him feel really embarrassed. Instinctively, Zhang Tie lowered his head to check the zipper on his trousers\u2026\u201cHere comes Miss Daina!\u201d a horny student shouted out loudly. Then, everybody in the classroom, including Zhang Tie, rushed to the windows and peered at the sexy figure passing through. Enjoying the view of the magnificent breasts, all the horny students considered it to be the most beautiful scenery in the world.Every window of the classroom was crowded with people enjoying the view of Miss Daina\u2019s figure. The classroom was filled with the sound of people swallowing saliva when the teacher of the first history class entered the classroom.As the most carefree class at school, the teachers would always freely talk about various topics ranging from knowledge and major historical events before the Catastrophe to mysterious legends in the Age of Black Iron. Everything could be mentioned in history class. Although some of the knowledge seemed meaningless, they had actually expanded Zhang Tie\u2019s horizon. All the information Zhang Tie knew about the human world before the Catastrophe was mostly from the history class. Some of the horny students in the class were not interested in the contents of the natural history class in the least, thus they would usually sleep during each class. In comparison, Zhang Tie would always listen to each history class very carefully. In today\u2019s class, the teacher taught about the exploration of the universe by the human race. At that time, human beings had launched a machine that flew even faster than sound. They started to explore the two moons circling the Kun\u2019ang Continent. It was said that they realized a major discovery during that exploration; however, commoners were not privy to this information in the least, as the human ruler did not disclose this information to the public. Therefore, even now, no one else knew what they had found. To be able to enable those metal machines to fly into the moons was a really amazing thing. Zhang Tie really longed for it and started to imagine it in the classroom.After the bell rang, Barley glanced at Zhang Tie. They then went out of the classroom with the rest of the members from the Hit-Plane Brotherhood and arrived at a corner of a small garden under the teaching building.\u201cBighead, we called you here to tell you one thing!\u201d Barley said to Zhang Tie solemnly. \u201cDo these guys want to beat me up? No, it doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d Zhang Tie felt gloomy. \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cWe brotherhood members don\u2019t agree with you leaving!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you know that I have caused a big incident at school?\u201d looking directly into the fatty\u2019s bandit-sharp eyes, Zhang Tie decided to explain it to them all.\u201cYou mean you have offended Glaze\u2019s group?\u201d crossing his arms, Bagdad said calmly. \u201cThey broke the rules first, so if they dare to give our brother trouble, then we\u2019ll fight them to the death!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Doug put his big palm onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cTrust us, bro. You have us. Don\u2019t worry, we will help you through this trouble. We are very proud to be your brothers!\u201d\u201cDo they have one more d*ck than us?\u201d Hista started to thrust his waist before placing his hand on Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder.\u201cIn the worst case scenario, we can set them up!\u201d Hista added viciously. Right then, another hand appeared on Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt\u2019s nothing serious to be beaten together with you!\u201d Shrugging his shoulders, Sharwin put one of his hand onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder.\u201cThis is our decision about you leaving!\u201d Barley smirked obscenely as he placed his hand on Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t forget that I will take you there for you to be a real man! How could you leave at the critical moment?\u201d Everybody placed their hands on Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders unconsciously. They did this to encourage Zhang Tie. However, they finally realized that Bagdad was still coldly standing at a distance. Everyone set their eyes on their black buddy. Feeling somewhat isolated, Bagdad also stretched out one hand and placed it onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder. Thus, by then, standing at the center, Zhang Tie was surrounded by six brothers, each of whom had placed one of their hands onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder or back. The whole scene was religious to some degree. All of a sudden, the youths felt as if they were doing something holy, and their hearts started to pound heavily.\u201cYou bastards!\u201d Zhang Tie abruptly felt like crying. At that moment, he felt very powerful. The source of his power didn\u2019t originate from his Shrine burning point but from that pounding heart. He felt like he had nothing to fear in this world anymore.Returning to the classroom once again, the group of seven sat close to each other, feeling different from before. Yet, they couldn\u2019t figure out why. Every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood seemed stronger and more dauntless than before. They felt a sense of interdependence deep in their hearts. That was really amazing\u2026Fatty was also smiling as he felt that the brotherhood had become different from before. It was great! Previously, the seven of them were just like seven parts bundled together. Now, Barley felt that the seven parts had already been activated and had spontaneously already formed into a more powerful part, causing him to feel reassured. Stroking his mustache, Barley recalled the scene where the members had placed their hands on Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders and back. It increasingly felt like it was a holy ceremony for the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. If anyone else wanted to join the brotherhood, it seemed that he could test them through that religious ceremony\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After this class, I will retire officially\u2026\u201d the teacher said to the students at the beginning of the second morning class. Hearing this news, the whole classroom turned quiet. Even Zhang Tie could not imagine that this was the last class for the teacher. Since he entered the Seventh Male Middle School, he seemed to have gotten used to this gray-haired old man who would enter and leave the classroom quietly. He never thought that the senior would bid farewell to them on the rostrum. The moment the teacher delivered the news, even the fellows sleeping in the classroom seemed to become awake. They gaped at him and felt reluctant for his will-be retirement.\u201cAre you really going, teacher\u2026\u201d a guy in the front row poured out what the other students were thinking in their hearts.\u201cI am already very old, and I have also served Blackhot City for a long time. It\u2019s the right time for me to retire!\u201d The old man showed a friendly smile. \u201cI know what you are worried about. As long as the city walls of Blackhot City aren\u2019t broken by the alien forces, my pension would be enough for me to live the rest of my life in peace. And you guys are the ones who will ensure that the city walls will stand firm forever, not me. That\u2019s why, whether I will live a peaceful life or not after retirement will depend on you! In today\u2019s final history class, I will talk to you about my experiences and knowledge of what I\u2019ve seen that is required to be a powerful man who can protect the human race.\u201dHearing the final sentence, everybody\u2019s spirit rose. All the students sat straight instantly and stared at this revered old man with reluctant expressions.The old man was then silent. Pulling out a small, ordinary snail shell and two pine cones from his pocket, he passed them to the front row and let the students observe them one by one. After one minute, the snail shell and the two pine cones had been passed through the hands of every student. Nobody found anything special with them, including Zhang Tie who had thoroughly checked it for a couple of seconds but was unable to find anything.\u201cDo you guys notice anything special about the snail shell and the two pine cones?\u201d the old man asked. Everybody shook their heads.\u201cYou should know that the secret for the average human to become stronger is hidden within these ordinary things! We all know that people should always be trying to ignite their burning points to improve their strength, and we also know that human fighters are classified at different levels. Some people are LV 5, some are LV 6, some are LV7, and there are even some who have reached LV 10 or higher. However, who classified our fighters? Are those classifications made by the big figures in the Fighters Union?\u201dZhang Tie was startled, as he had always thought that the standards were created by the big figures. It wasn\u2019t made by them?\u201cOf course not, no one is entitled the right to create the standard in which billions of commoners and powerful figures pursue!\u201d\u201cTeacher, then who made the standard?\u201d\u201cThe person who created it wasn\u2019t a human being \u2014 but a god or the laws of the great universe!\u201dHearing his words, the whole classroom became bustling.\u201cThose standards were not made especially for the human clan, but for everything in this universe. The snail shell and the two pine cones I have shown you also follows the standard, but you didn\u2019t notice them!\u201d Afterwards, the old man drew two patterns on the blackboard using a piece of chalk. One was a spiral curve that was similar to a snail shell, while the other was some crisscrossed lines that were similar to the pine cones.Then, the old man turned around. \u201cHow many burning points do we need to ignite to become a LV 1 fighter?\u201d\u201cOne! We only need to ignite the Shrine burning point\u2026\u201d the students replied in unison. The old man then drew a square in the center of the square shell in a way that the spiral curve went through the two opposite corners of the square\u2026\u201cWhat about LV 2\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s also one. We just need to ignite the burning point on the tail bone of the spine!\u201dThe old man expanded the pattern and drew another square of the same size.\u201cWhat about LV 3?\u201d\u201cJust ignite two burning points on the spine!\u201dThis time, the old man double the length of the side of the square.\u201cWhat about LV 4?\u201d\u201cThree!\u201d\u201cLV 5?\u201d\u201cFive!\u201d\u201cLV 6?\u201d\u201cEight\u2026\u201dThe spiral curve was gradually wrapped by squares with side lengths that increased proportionally. Finally, when the old man asked how many burning points needed to be ignited to reach LV 10, nobody in the class could reply. Fighters above LV 10 were an amazing existence that the horny students could not imagine at all. For them, the world of fighters above LV 10 was as far as the Catastrophe itself\u2026Instead of mocking them, the teacher wrote down a series of numbers \u20141, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34\u2026 \u2014 along with their corresponding levels, 1 \u2013 LV 1 to 34 \u2013 LV 9. Finally, he turned around and looked at students with shining eyes. \u201cHave you ever figured out a law among those numbers?\u201dAfter staring at those numbers for a while, someone finally realized. \u201cEach number is the addition of the previous two!\u201d\u201cWhat else?\u201dLooking at number sequence, something in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind seemed to burst forth; however, Zhang Tie wasn\u2019t able to figure it out.\u201cWhy not divide the next by the earlier and figure out the law among them?\u201dAs the horny students had learned the basics of math, they lowered their heads and started to calculate the results. The first result was 1, the second result was 0.5, the third result was 0.66666\u2026, the fourth result was 0.6, the fifth result was, 0.625, the sixth result was 0.61538\u2026, the seventh result was 0.619047, and the either result was 0.617647\u2026\u201cHave you noticed that the numbers are infinitely close to 0.618?\u201d the teacher poured out the truth, enlightening all the students. Yea, how could that be?\u201cTo reach LV 1, one needs to ignite one burning point, while the human body has 33 vertebrae on the spine. When one ignites all the burning points on the spine, they would reach LV 9. Strict standards have been made for reaching each higher level. Likewise, you can calculate by yourself how many more burning points you need to ignite to become a LV 10 fighter. 55! Yes! What\u2019s next? 89! The number would grow geometrically in a terrifying way. That explained why the higher the levels were, the greater the differences would be, and this sequence\u2026\u201d the old man turned around and pointed at those numbers on the blackboard, \u201c\u2026is called Leonardo Fibonacci Sequence, which was the Golden Sequence that contained numerous secrets discovered by a human mathematician named Leonardo Fibonacci hundreds of years before the Catastrophe. It contains the universal law and the law of the creator. Look at the spirals on the right and left of the pine cones. Have you noticed that the smaller one has 5 lines on the left and 8 on the right, while the bigger one has 8 on the left and 13 on the right? The numbers 5, 8, and 13 directly correspond to the Fibonacci Sequence. You can check the squares on this snail shell curve. You will then understand the relationship between this curve and this sequence of numbers \u2014 the Fibonacci Curve or Golden Ratio. The curve is the geometric pattern of this sequence. You can find this relationship on most living begins. If you take a look at nature and the things beside you, you will find more examples. For instance, there are two groups of spirals inside the flower disc of a sunflower, and the corresponding numbers are 34 and 55, 55 and 89, 89 and 144. Similarly, you can get the same result in roses and thistle leaves. After the Catastrophe, people discovered the secrets to practice cultivation from the underground ruins and realized that all the improvement and cultivation that the human race were doing were in accordance with the Golden Ratio and the Fibonacci Sequence. Even all other living beings evolve along this curve. As the curve and the number sequence is the reflection of the universal law, fighters that didn\u2019t evolve in line with this curve and the number sequence would never be considered strong by the standards of all the humans and the powerful figures\u2026\u201dHearing the explanation, all the horny students had their eyes opened, including Zhang Tie. Previously, he only knew that he had to ignite different numbers of burning points to reach higher levels; however, he didn\u2019t know why and had never put thought into it. Whereas at that moment, Zhang Tie finally understood that all the secrets were hidden in the universal law in the golden spiral and that number sequence.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTeacher, what\u2019s the highest level after LV 10?\u201d raising his hand, Bagdad asked.\u201cEven now, nobody knows the answer to this question because what comes after LV 10 is one of the most confidential secrets in any place. Knowledge after LV 10 is top secret. The most important reason being that the golden number sequence is endless as it constantly develops and gets increasing closer to the perfect number, 0.618. It has been less than 900 years since human beings stepped onto the road of cultivation in accordance with the golden spiral and have started to explore the treasures within their own body. In contrast, the universe has already existed for tens of billions of years. This means that we human beings have just started on the golden spiral. Before the Catastrophe, people were always proud of themselves. At that time, they treated themselves as the lord of the universe and everything else. However, after the Catastrophe, humankind started to realize that the human clan was just a trivial member among the numerous clans in the vacant universe and the Kun\u2019ang Continent. The human body and human civilization might even have regressed instead of further evolving over a long period of time before the Catastrophe. When it was no longer able to regress even further, the Catastrophe and the Star of God arrived and all the rules were rewritten. People also discovered the secrets hidden within their body that would aid them in survival, leading them back onto the path of evolution. The Age of Black Iron \u2014 the end of the past and the beginning of the future\u2026\u201dIn the final history class, the teacher opened an unprecedented window for them which really broadened their view. For the remaining time in the class, all the horny students manually calculated the numbers in the Golden Sequence.1\uff0c1\uff0c2\uff0c3\uff0c5\uff0c8\uff0c13\uff0c21\uff0c34\uff0c55\uff0c89\uff0c144\uff0c233\uff0c377\uff0c610\uff0c987\uff0c1597\u2026Zhang Tie gaped when he got to the 17th number in the Golden Sequence. He couldn\u2019t believe his eyes when his line of sight fell onto the last seven numbers. \u201cIs this the number of burning points needed to be ignited after LV 10\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie was really shocked.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The number sequence was something that they had never heard about. Zhang Tie considered the number sequence to be a form of mysterious knowledge, one which could not be easily obtained by commoners.\u201cAn extremely strong human fighter should not only have overwhelming power on the battlefield; more importantly, they should have a pair of sharp eyes that are able to discern the sources of power that make him strong like the laws of nature and the universe. Through my classes, I hope that everyone of you will finally have a pair of these sharp eyes!\u201dAfter saying that, the old man left in his usual calm manner under the silent gaze of all the horny students.Knowing that they would soon graduate, the teacher decided to give his blessings to everyone in his last class.\u2026\u2026When the class was over, Zhang Tie leaned against the walls in the corridor and stared at the plants in the parterre under the stairs. The horny students couldn\u2019t help but rush downstairs to count the number of petals on the roses in an attempt to test the mysterious number sequence.Thinking of the last history class today and perhaps even the last one for the rest of his life, Zhang Tie felt slightly dejected.\u201cThat man is very respectable\u2026\u201d said Bagdad. Without Zhang Tie noticing, the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood had already gotten close to him. \u201cThe relationship between the Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Spiral and the relationship between the level of a fighter and numerous things in nature are definitely some form of mysterious knowledge. I have talked about this topic with some of his former students, and even they didn\u2019t know about the relationships and its secrets. The old man probably poured out this mysterious knowledge because this is his final history class\u2026\u201d\u201cMind your own business! LV 10\u2026 I have never seen a LV 10 fighter at all. If there was a member above LV 6 among us, we would have nothing to fear at all. I\u2019ve heard that Glaze\u2019s dad is a LV 6 Black Spider!\u201d Hista said languidly.Waving his fist fiercely, Bagdad gloomily said, \u201cI will definitely reach LV 6!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s solve our trouble first! I feel like some guys are giving us some very unfriendly looks!\u201dAlong the direction Leit pointed at, they found Glaze\u2019s group staring at them furiously on the other side of the corridor. Zhang Tie was evidently their target. Even when they had noticed that the brotherhood of seven turned to them at the same time, they didn\u2019t spare them a single glance; they only looked at Zhang Tie. When Zhang Tie noticed them, Zuhair, one of Glaze\u2019s most devoted followers, made an aggressive and menacing gesture of slitting his throat with a thumb toward Zhang Tie.\u201cLeit, you\u2019re wrong. They\u2019re not looking at us, they\u2019re looking at Bighead. We\u2019re being ignored!\u201d Sharwin said languidly.\u201cWhat the f*ck. We are the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. Those bastards dare to provoke us? On the count of \u20181 2 3\u2019, let\u2019s go send them a greeting from our brotherhood, so they\u2019ll stop ignoring us,\u201d Barley suggested to the side. Then he started to count, \u201cCome. 1\u2026 2\u2026 3\u2026 F*ck you\u2026\u201dAfter the countdown, the group of seven, including Zhang Tie, raised their middle fingers towards Glaze\u2019s group, causing the expression of Glaze\u2019s group to suddenly become twisted. Doug had also turned around and pulled down his trousers before starting to slap his butt. He then turned around and started to stroke his little brother as he faced them. Seeing Doug\u2019s actions, all the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood started to laugh loudly, frightening the people around them\u2026By the third class, the news of the two groups clashing and mutually provoking each other in the corridor had already been spread through the whole grade. Many people had already prepared to see what would happen. Zhang Tie\u2019s group had also prepared to fight with Glaze\u2019s group at noon or after lunch. Thinking of how they would be accompanied by six other brothers if they were fiercely beaten by the other group and sent to lay in the hospital, the group of seven looked extremely righteous and dauntless.\u201cIf Glaze\u2019s group dares to provoke us at noon, we\u2019ll f*ck them up fiercely. Bagdad, you are the strongest one among us, so you\u2019ll be responsible for Glaze when we fight. Leit and I will be responsible for Sharon, Bighead and Hista will be responsible for Zuhair, and Doug and Sharwin will be responsible for Garner. Except for Bagdad, the six of us will form into three groups. Any group that cleared their target will go support Bagdad. Once we solve the problem of Glaze\u2019s three followers, we will fight Glaze together. No matter what, even if we are beaten fiercely, we have to at least bite off some flesh from Glaze. If anyone dares to bully our brother, we will f*ck them up\u2026\u201d Fatty arranged the tactics with the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood in the classroom after the third class. Nobody showed any disagreement. Zhang Tie had originally planned to fight Glaze alone, as he had already been promoted to LV 1. Through last night\u2019s 'skeleton rearrangement\u201d, Zhang Tie felt a bit more powerful than even Bagdad, regardless of the difference in muscles. However, seeing that ambitious mood of Bagdad, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t say anything. He wouldn\u2019t be able to explain how he had ignited his Shrine burning point so fast anyways.In the fourth class, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t listen to what the teacher taught at all. Instead, he recovered his composure and focused his attention on his belly, which gave off a warm and comfortable feeling after having ignited the Shrine burning point. Along with this comfortable feeling, he felt an energetic wave slowly spreading throughout all his muscles and bones. The Shrine burning point was like a marvelous, small door in his body that had been pushed open. Ever since the door was open, something strange was floating from the door. This explained why a common LV 1 fighter could defeat most ordinary soldiers. The ignition of the Shrine burning point indicated that physical abilities and functions of that person have started to improve. As the history teacher said, once one had ignited their Shrine burning point, they would be standing at the starting line of evolution in accordance to the Golden Spiral, which represented the laws of the universe and the creator. The difference between a LV 1 fighter and an ordinary fighter was similar to the difference between a fighter standing on the starting line and the spectator who was watching the race outside the runway. In most cases, the spectators in the audience outside the runway would hardly be able to catch up with someone who was already on the starting line when the race began\u2026\u201cI am already a LV 1 fighter. Only one level away from Glaze,\u201d Zhang Tie constantly reminded himself in the classroom and became increasingly confident.Class was finally over. Seeing the others rushing towards the cafeteria, the group of seven stayed behind.\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Barley asked. According to the tradition in the Male Middle School, whenever two groups held aggression toward each other, they would fight on the same day, usually at noon or in the afternoon when class was over. The small woods beside the cafeteria was always the best place to fight or solve personal affairs.Everybody nodded.\u201cDo you remember your targets?\u201dEverybody nodded again.\u201cIt\u2019s a good day for us to be famous in school. Come on, let\u2019s go!\u201d Fatty waved his hands heroically. Then, the group of seven walked out of the classroom, brimming with confidence.\u201cErm\u2026 could you please wait for me for a second\u2026\u201d Doug said sadly with a flushed face.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sharwin asked as his nose turned red. \u201cThe fight will start soon\u201d.\u201cMy stomach isn\u2019t feeling too well, I\u2019d like to use the washroom!\u201d saying that, Doug\u2019s face was almost lowered all the way to the crotch of his trousers. \u201cIt\u2026 might have been breakfast\u2026 and\u2026 the pulling-down of my trousers just now\u2026 I have a stomachache. It\u2019s really hard to stand it, and I don\u2019t think I can stand it any longer. I think if I don\u2019t solve it right now, it will weaken our total battle force\u2026\u201dThe other six gaped at each other. Fatty opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something; however, in the end, he replied dejectedly, \u201cHurry up, we will wait for you to return!\u201dEverybody waited outside the washroom for ten minutes. When Doug finally came out, he looked much more energetic; however, the morale of the other six had already weakened from 90% to 60%.\u201cCome on, let\u2019s finish lunch first. Though, we probably won\u2019t get enough plates today\u2026\u201d Barley weakly waved his hand.Nevertheless, when Zhang Tie\u2019s group arrived at the cafeteria, they could not believe their eyes. Surrounded by hundreds of furious students, Glaze\u2019s group looked really scared. At the same time, someone from the same grade was standing on a dining table and was instigating those horny students to fight them\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are we scared of them just because Glaze is a LV 2 fighter? Are they more dangerous than the wild beasts that we will meet outside the city walls in a week? If we dare to risk our lives to face the challenges outside the walls, then why are you afraid of them?\u201d Standing on a dining table, a man was provoking the others as he used his limbs to make gestures. As a result, the horny students in the cafeteria became increasingly excited. He then continued, \u201cThose who are being bullied by them, do you dare to show up? Those who don\u2019t want to be bullied by them, do you dare to show up? They are only four people, yet we have at least 400. Why should we fear them? Why should we be bullied by them? Once we unite with each other, we will definitely have no reason to fear them. Can they withstand our siege? Let\u2019s drive those bastards away from the cafeteria and never let them in before graduation. From today onwards, once they dare to take revenge on one of us, we will take revenge on them together with even more intensity.

Miss Daina is watching us\u2026\u201dBeing incited, the horny students became really excited. Those who were bullied by Glaze became even more excited.\u201cF*ck \u2018em to death\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck those bastards\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck \u2018em to death\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s time to end this\u2026\u201d\u201cF*ck\u2026\u201dEverybody in the cafeteria became excited and gradually moved towards Glaze\u2019s group.Zhang Tie and Barley looked at each other for a while before Barley said, \u201cLet\u2019s f*ck \u2019em together with the other students\u2026\u201d Thinking for a while, Zhang Tie nodded. Then, the seven members of the brotherhood glanced at each other and nodded.Seeing the student provoking others on the dining table, Zhang Tie suddenly understood Donder\u2019s proverb\u2014\u201ca soft tongue could break hard bones\u201d.However, before Zhang Tie was able to put in much thought into it, Bagdad had already rushed forward and kicked Sharon onto the ground, resulting in all the horny students no longer able to wait as they immediately surged forward with furious growls. A chaotic battle started\u2026When the students surged forward toward Glaze\u2019s group, Zhang Tie swept his gaze at the common looking boy who stood on the table and noticed a flash of a smile at that moment. Zhang Tie became a bit uncomfortable when he realized that Miss Daina\u2019s promise was used by someone to provoke others.In fact, if a LV 2 fighter was afraid of fighting back, he would soon be defeated by a group of green birds who didn\u2019t even reach LV 1. If Glaze were to fight them without any restraints, then the other students would have to pay a considerable price. Glaze was not a fool. Although he would stop someone from leaving and beat them fiercely after school, he didn\u2019t dare to cripple a group of furious students. He knew that if he did that, what awaited him would not simply be lashes. Even his dad wouldn\u2019t be able to settle his punishment.Bench press: 290kg;Deep squat: 380kg;Maximum explosiveness of right fist: 510kg;Maximum explosiveness of left fist: 340kg;Maximum explosiveness of leg: 780kg;Resistance: 13;At this moment, Glaze could only try his best to protect Sharon, Zuhair, and Garnier while dozens of punches and kicks came from all directions. Glaze\u2019s group suffered greatly; with the exception of Glaze, his three followers cried miserably.When Bagdad surged forward and started this whole mess, the other six members of the brotherhood were unable to push inside at all. As a result, they could only watch the awkward state of Glaze\u2019s group through the thick wall of people.Finally, Glaze was no longer able to withstand it after having been kicked in the face and belly several times. He no longer had any choice. With a furious growl, he rushed towards several people behind him and escaped from the cafeteria with Sharon and his two other peers.\u201cWe\u2019ve chased them away\u2026 We have won\u2026\u201d Seeing Glaze\u2019s group escaping the cafeteria, all the horny students became ecstatic\u2026On the Friday one week before graduation, an insignificant student named Burwick immediately became famous within the Seventh National Male Middle School for completely defeating Glaze\u2019s group. Additionally, in the same afternoon, the physique test revealed that Burwick had already ignited his Shrine burning point, indicating that he was already a LV 1 fighter. This sudden revelation shocked everyone, as this would make him the second strongest fighter after Glaze among the undergraduates. Although Glaze was one level higher than Burwick in terms of physique and fighting strength, everybody knew that Glaze\u2019s time in the spotlight has passed. After the two events in the past two days, Glaze had lost all face in front of the other students. The day before, he was whipped by Captain Kerlin. Today, he was beaten by all the other horny students very fiercely. As a result, he was like a mouse passing the street that was beaten by every passer-by at school.In the past, everybody would be in awe at Glaze\u2019s performance in the training grounds every Friday afternoon and would admire his records as well. However, today, although Glaze was still unparalleled in those physical aspects and in fighting strength, he could only hear sounds of dislike and ridicule. For the whole afternoon, Glaze looked dejected and kept silent. As he listened to other people admiring Burwick, he casted a hateful look at Zhang Tie from time to time.Noticing Glaze\u2019s furious glare, Zhang Tie became gradually alert and tried to be low-keyed. Zhang Tie faintly felt that the hatred between him and Glaze was deepening.In the afternoon, Zhang Tie was very low-key. In every assessment, he tried and performed as he usually would, though he had spared some effort. After having ignited the Shrine burning point, his physique was greatly enhanced in all aspects, and this was especially seen in the 100m dash. In the past, Zhang Tie had always spent a gargantuan amount of effort, only to get a poor mark in the end; however, this time, the result was completely different. The moment he heard the whistle, Zhang Tie had surged forward like an arrow. Surprisingly, his explosiveness and speed were obviously higher than before. He felt extremely nimble and soon rushed ahead of the others; however, glancing back at the people beside him, Zhang Tie slowed down and eventually finished in 6th place. Although he received no mark this time, as usual, he felt very satisfied with his result. Since he had spared some effort this time, Zhang Tie clearly knew that he would be able to break through 11 seconds if he tried. The marks of his other items under Zhang Tie\u2019s deliberate control were as follows:Bench Press\u2014\u2014140kgLifting force in deep squat\u2014\u2014180kgExplosiveness of Fists\u2014\u2014Right Fist: 260kg; Left Fist: 200kgMaximum Kicking Explosiveness of the Legs\u2014\u2014320kgMaximum Continual Armor-Breaking Spikes\u2014\u201452The results from his tests were the same as usual. Aside from Zhang Tie himself, no one else was concerned about his results. Although it was a bit better than before, it did not attract any attention.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThis way, people won\u2019t be suspicious,\u201d Zhang Tie mocked himself. What had happened today led Zhang Tie to deeply understand the truth\u2014in this age when everyone was striving for their own survival, one should remember to avoid being the target for anyone no matter where one was, as one would never know who was closeby and wanted to beat them to death. Glaze\u2019s failure was caused by his arrogance. Even as a LV 2 fighter, the proud guy was marked as a loser during his last two weeks at school. In contrast, nobody had noticed Burwick before this incident at all. He took this opportunity to climb above Glaze, becoming the new star of the school\u2026\u201cCompared to Burwick, Glaze is just an idiot!\u201d Barley said to Zhang Tie under the shade of a tree during the afternoon break. \u201cThat guy took advantage of what had happened to you yesterday and what had happened to our brotherhood this morning. He really seized the overwhelming opportunity to cause trouble to Glaze\u2019s group. I suspect that that guy has always been waiting for an opportunity to use the animosity towards Glaze to attack him and to use Glaze\u2019s threats to unite the others. This guy was actually that terrifying. He hid the fact that he was a LV 1 fighter. This guy is actually not as open-hearted and righteous as he looked; he is actually really dangerous\u2014you have to be careful around him!\u201dZhang Tie nodded and recalled the smile that flashed on Burwick\u2019s face when the others surged forward to attack Glaze\u2019s group\u2026Afterwards, bustling sounds reverberated from a few steps away. Without even looking, Zhang Tie naturally knew that the exclamations were for Burwick. Being surrounded by a great amount of people, Burwick was showing his obvious physical advantage as a LV 1 fighter over common soldiers. At the same time, a great amount of horny students were shouting in amazement.That afternoon, besides Burwick, Bagdad also became eye-attractive by hitting Glaze\u2019s group\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhang Tie, who had already become a LV 1 fighter, could easily deal with Andrew Benet\u2019s attacks. Sometimes, Zhang Tie could even control the rhythm of attacks from that kid, purposely allowing some of his attacks to connect on specific parts of his body. Of course, Zhang Tie would pretend to be kicked over by that kid to satisfy his vanity. Whenever he was knocked over, he would always stand up before saying, \u201cCome on, baby\u201d. As a result, that kid would always charge toward him with red eyes.This job of being a training partner was seen as a hard job to many people; however, for Zhang Tie, it gradually turned into an interesting game\u2014he would receive payment to accelerate the growth of the Iron Body Fruit. Through constantly being beaten up, Zhang Tie had also noticed that his fighting skills had improved. He was able to respond to his opponent\u2019s attacks faster than before and could more accurately identify the opponent\u2019s attacking intention. As the party that was on the side of purely being beaten, Zhang Tie would sometimes even take control of the rhythm of the battle.\u201cThat one-eyed man really helped me a lot!\u201d Zhang Tie felt happy inside.As Zhang Tie hadn\u2019t been knocked out from the past couple of times and had performed better than before, he felt that his standing in the fighting club had improved. At the very least, the two bastards from the equipment room would no longer mock or place bets on whether he would be knocked out again. Additionally, when he left the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, Director Beck had even encouraged him to work harder and settled his weekly payment of 3 silver and 40 copper coins. This marks the first time Zhang Tie had earned money.Zhang Tie tightly held onto the coins in his pockets on his way home. When he arrived at his house, he realized that the coins had already become hot. Handing over the coins to his mom, Zhang Tie felt extremely satisfied at the sight of her amazed expression. In the end, his mom only took two silver coins and said she would store them away for Zhang Tie, leaving the rest as his pocket money. This was the first time he contributed to his family through his own efforts, causing him to be filled with pleasure and pride.On Saturday, as usual, Zhang Tie helped his mom make rice brew at home; however, it was different this time. This time, his sister-in-law joined them, thus Zhang Tie felt that it was much easier than before since he had less to do. His sister-in-law was diligent and clever. She was someone who excelled at housework and had a good reputation in the neighborhood. Since her arrival at their place, she had also gradually become accepted by the Zhang\u2019s family.Watching his mom teach his sister-in-law how to make rice brew, Zhang Tie became dejected. His mom was growing old, yet he only had a little time left to accompany her\u2026The lives of commoners always had its ups and downs. On the same Saturday, Zhang Tie found that the price of rice had once again increased when he arrived at the rice store with his ugly three-wheeler. This time, the price went from 4 silver and 58 copper coins per 25kg to 4 silver and 61 copper coins per 25kg. He inquired different rice stores and was quoted the same price. Additionally, he found that the prices of other foods had also rose in price at different degrees, among which the price of sugar rose the most sharply. Compared to the price of rice, the price of rice sugar had increased by more than 10% per kg this week, surpassing the price of 1 silver and 11 copper coins per kg\u2026However, Zhang Tie had no choice but to buy it. As a result, the Zhang Family had to increase the price of the rice brew, which would definitely weaken its sales. This would definitely prove to be detrimental to their living standards.Hearing the news of the increasing cost of rice, the wrinkles on his mom\u2019s forehead seemed to be more pronounced, although her expression remained unchanged.In the same evening, Zhang Tie sowed a lot of pumpkin seeds on the land in the Castle of Black Iron. Those seeds were scooped out from a pumpkin by his mom several days ago. His mom was so diligent that she felt reluctant to throw them away, hence she washed them and dried them in the courtyard. She knew that those pumpkin seeds would be delicious after being fried.Zhang Tie sowed about 200 to 300 pumpkin seeds. Zhang Tie did this for two reasons. The first reason was the increasing price of grains. The second reason was that he had realized that the Castle of Black Iron was really suitable for agriculture. Including the gifts he received from Grandma Teresa, all the seeds he had sown the week before had already sprouted and were growing well. The potatoes and niblets especially seemed to grow better. And as a result, the Castle of Black Iron started to show more signs of vitality as the aura value in the Castle of Black Iron was growing quickly every day. By Saturday, the aura value would turn to 70, surpassing all the other values.After throwing the bag of trash from home into the Pool of Chaos, Zhang Tie had only gained 0.1 unit of basic energy storage. After land reclamation in the Castle of Black Iron, he checked the fruits on the small tree. The Iron Body Fruit was 50% ripe; it seemed that he would be able to enjoy it after being beaten another two times. Additionally, the second Leakless Fruit would also become ripe on the next Thursday evening. This small tree had become the largest source of Zhang Tie\u2019s confidence to become prominent in this age.Right when he exited the Castle of Black Iron and was about to cultivate in his room, Zhang Tie heard a long and sharp sound outside his window that drifted from afar. As the sound of this manual fire alarm could spread very far in the evening, Zhang Tie was immediately able to hear it, thus Zhang Tie hurriedly went over to the windowsill and opened the window as he looked into the far distance. In the pitch black night, a strong fire brightened the entire distant sky. Judging from the source of the fire, Zhang Tie felt that it happened in the old agglomeration of Blackhot City where people from all walks of life gathered. Faint cries and shouts reverberated from the distance\u2026Zhang Tie wondered whose house caught fire near the railway station. He then ignored it and closed the window. Picking up the crystal from the windowsill, Zhang Tie sat cross-legged on his bed and started to cultivate.After having ignited the Shrine burning point, Zhang Tie could instantly feel the 'small point\u201d near his tail bone shaking once he entered meditation. In the opposite direction of the Shrine burning point, the first burning point on the spine became the next target of Zhang Tie. In accordance with the introduction of the history teacher on Friday, this burning point was the one burning point he had to ignite to reach LV 2. According to the Fibonacci Golden Number Sequence, he would then have to ignite two burning points to reach LV 3, followed by three burning points to reach LV 4, then five burning points to reach LV 5, and eight burning points to reach LV 6\u2026 Those burning points lined up on the 34 vertebrae on the human body. There were many secrets hidden in the vertebrae burning points. Similar to the vertebrae, those burning points were also the support and the source of a human\u2019s strength. When ignited, each burning point could enhance a person\u2019s physique and strength greatly. That explained why the other students were not a match for Glaze, a LV 2 fighter\u2026After entering meditation, along with Zhang Tie\u2019s spiritual energy, the energy gathered by the crystal passed into the first burning point on the spine. After more than 2 hours, Zhang Tie was only able to cause the burning point to be slightly brighter as it started to burn with a small red flame the size of a rice grain. Compared to the blazing Shrine burning point, that was only a small firefly. It was time and energy consuming for most people to practice igniting each point\u2026On Sunday afternoon, Zhang Tie stayed at home to take care of the rice brew store, while his dad and mom changed into new clothes and left with his soon-to-be sister-in-law with goods in hand. Naturally, Zhang Tie knew where they were heading to. In the evening, his mom and his soon-to-be sister-in-law returned in a pleasant mood. Seeing the two of them, Zhang Tie knew they must have gone to visit his sister-in-law\u2019s parents.Today, he had increased the price for Zhang\u2019s rice brew by one copper. Despite having put up a notice in advance, their sales were immediately lowered. Today, they had only sold a bit more than half of their usual sales\u201cMom, where\u2019s dad?\u201d seeing them, Zhang Tie asked curiously.\u201cHe\u2019s got something to deal with. He will come back later!\u201d his mom replied in a mysterious tone.At the time they prepared to have supper, his dad came back with a long article wrapped in cloth in hand. At the sight of Zhang Tie, his dad smiled and undid the package, revealing a sheathed, slightly arched black sword in front of Zhang Tie.\u201cAh!? The Blackhot Sharp-Edge Sword\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie exclaimed and instantly ran forward as if he saw a treasure. Grabbing the sword from his dad\u2019s hands, he unsheathed the blade, revealing a sharp two-handed sword in front of his eyes. Etched onto the body of the sword next to the handle was two words\u2014Zhang Tie. He couldn\u2019t help but exclaim. This was a gift from his dad.\u201cYou will be attending the survival training next week, so here\u2019s my gift for you. Heh\u2026heh\u2026\u201d His dad looked a bit embarrassed. \u201cThis is an ordinary, sharp sword made by the forge of Blackhot City. Although it can\u2019t match the swords used in the military and the sheath is only made of ordinary iron and wood, it\u2019s the best I can afford. So I hope you\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI love it, dad!\u201d Before his dad was able to finish his sentence, Zhang Tie instantly hugged him as he kissed his dad\u2019s face. He was really satisfied with the gift. Zhang Tie clearly knew that this ordinary Blackhot Sharp-Edge Sword would cost his dad at least one gold coin. That was a great expenditure for his family.Seeing Zhang Tie so happy, his dad also showed a warm smile\u2026\u201cTwo of you, come on. Let\u2019s eat while the food is still hot\u2026\u201d his mom warned them, trying to alleviate the atmosphere\u2026In this age, the first sword of many people was gifted by either their father or their brother. Aside from representing the blessings and concerns of their relatives, the sword also carried the meaning that the owner will be fighting for their own life with it. This was the inevitable fate of many males and their families!In the last week before he left school, Zhang Tie, a 15-year old boy, frankly accepted his own fate along with the first sword in his life, which was engraved with his name\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The undergraduates felt anxious about their safety, as there has been casualties every year during the survival training. This was not simply a trip in the wild but a test of their abilities to survive in the cruelty of this age. The world within the city walls was utterly different from outside the city walls.On Monday morning, all the horny undergraduates stayed in an amphitheater as they waited for the teacher. However, the person that arrived this time wasn\u2019t their usual teacher; it was a fellow student who had graduated the year before and was now a soldier serving the City Guard Army of Blackhot City.He told them of his past experiences on the trip and how he had witnessed the death of two peers because of carelessness in the last year\u2019s survival training. They were killed by a seemingly harmless White-Bone Mushroom. When they boiled the mushroom and consumed it along with the soup, they were unfortunately unable to get up the next morning, as they had already been poisoned to death when they were found. Only when the White-Bone Mushroom was found inside the soup was the cause of death discovered\u2026Nothing particularly stood out in the story, and the reason for the tragedy was also simple. From its looks alone, the poisonous White-Bone Mushroom looked almost identical to the common, edible umbrella-shaped mushroom. The only difference between them were the gray circular grains over the rootstalk of the White-Bone Mushroom. Since the person responsible for scavenging for food wasn\u2019t able to distinguish between the two mushrooms, he lost his life. Although it was a simple story, it was because of the simplicity of the events that caused everyone to feel a chill. At this moment, they realized the cruelty of the survival training. Knowledge regarding the White-Bone Mushroom and the umbrella-shaped mushroom was something that was taught in school; however, if one doesn\u2019t remember it firmly, they would solely be responsible for the mistakes in the future at the cost of their own or even another person\u2019s life\u2026All the horny students were shocked when they heard what the fellow student said. That class was ten thousand times more effective than what the other teachers had taught. The school probably knew about the difference as well; hence, why they arranged the class on their last Monday at school, so as to warn them.The moment the morning class was over, all the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood surrounded Sharwin.\u201cSharwin, have you kept your biology notes for the past two years with you?\u201d Fatty Barley pressed down on Sharwin\u2019s shoulders and asked him nervously while the other members were nervously waiting for Sharwin\u2019s response to the side. The story was really terrifying. Nobody would know whether they had forgotten any crucial knowledge during the past three years, as the world outside the city walls was much more dangerous than they could imagine. It was unfortunate to be eaten while fighting a magical beast with full preparations; however, if you lost your life because of your carelessness, you would fully deserve it.\u201cYea, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Sharwin asked in a confused way.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Of course, you should lend them to us, so that we can have a good review\u2026\u201d\u201cAlright, no problem!\u201d Sharwin answered without any hesitation. \u201cI have preserved those notes well. There are two more notebooks at home. I will bring them if you need them!\u201dHearing this, Fatty Barley rolled his eyes. Something seemed to come to his mind as he said, \u201cBros, maybe we can make some money with Sharwin\u2019s notes!\u201dAll the other members also realized it at the same time. Even Zhang Tie was admiring Barley\u2019s intelligence. However, their plan to make money by Sharwin\u2019s notes failed in the same afternoon. When Fatty Barley was planning the price of a copy of Sharwin\u2019s notes, Burwick made all the horny students boisterous once again.\u2026\u201cHurry up, let\u2019s go find Burwick. He has already made a copy of the notes from the biology classes over the past couple of years and turned them into a brochure calledIn these days, Glaze\u2019s group was never seen in the school cafeteria again. It was impossible for them to show off in the school cafeteria anymore. Actually, they would feel reluctant gazes, so they directly ate in hotels outside the school.\u201cGuess what Glaze\u2019s group ate this noon?\u201d There would always be someone shouting this when queuing up in the cafeteria. Hearing his words, all the other horny students started to laugh out loudly.In contrast, Burwick became increasingly more popular at school, resulting in a great number of people standing by his side.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know why, but ever since Monday, his heart always pounded and his hands sweated more than usual. These days, he felt weak for no reason. On Tuesday when Zhang Tie arrived at the Railway Station once again, he found more magistrates patrolling the area than usual. Out of curiosity, he asked a person nearby about what had happened. It turned out that many people were burnt to death in that fire accident near the Railway Station a couple of days ago. That\u2019s why those magistrates nearby the railway station became more alert, though they seemed to have found no clues regarding that fire accident.Zhang Tie arrived at the grocery store as usual. While settling the accounts, a heart pounding feeling was felt again, causing him to make two consecutive mistakes. Zhang Tie smiled bitterly and pushed all the beads back to their original places before he started to calculate again.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Donder asked to Zhang Tie when he realized something was off about him.\u201cNothing serious, just a little bit distracted. These days, my heart has been speeding up for no reason!\u201d\u201cHeart speeding up for no reason?\u201d Hearing this, Donder gradually frowned. \u201cDoes anyone from your family have a heart disease?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cDid you have such a feeling before?\u201d Donder continued.\u201cAlso no. I started to feel it this Monday!\u201d Zhang Tie answered honestly.\u201cAre you a virgin?\u201d\u201cShit!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inside. However, he didn\u2019t say anything when he saw the serious face of Fatty Donder.\u201cAnswer me, I\u2019m not kidding!\u201d Donder looked more serious than he has ever looked, which almost frightened Zhang Tie.\u201cI am a virgin!\u201d Zhang Tie could only admit. Feeling like he lost face, he then added, \u201cBut I won\u2019t soon!\u201dAfter a while, Donder muttered while rubbing his sparse mustache, \u201cHave you heard about Blood Tide Sense?\u201d\u201cBlood Tide Sense?\u201d Zhang Tie was puzzled. Then, he seemed to realize something immediately and nodded. \u201cI have heard about it from those horny students\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could someone from your school know about this Oriental mysterious knowledge?\u201d Donder was startled.\u201cThat is an Oriental secret?\u201d Zhang Tie was curious. \u201cMany people know about it. I heard females would bleed so much every month, yet they wouldn\u2019t be hurt. They are truly strong\u2026\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201d the boss cursed as the corners of his eyes twitched. At the same time, he flicked Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead with a finger, causing Zhang Tie to feel so much pain that he jumped up. \u201cI mean Blood Sense. Have you heard about it? No crap! I have played with more women than you have seen, you scumbag!\u201dZhang Tie innocently rubbed his forehead. He truly didn\u2019t know where he was wrong. He really thought that women were stubborn beings, as they bleed but feel no pain.Sucking in deep breaths, Donder recovered his composure. Staring at Zhang Tie, he said, \u201cThe so-called Blood Tide Sense means that some lucky dogs might be able to feel impending danger or a fruitful opportunity. They would feel like how you feel these days; with Blood Tide Sense, you would always feel your heart pounding and would also feel excited. People who had a sharp sixth sense or virgin males might have the same feeling as you. I suspect that you have Blood Tide Sense and an unpredictable danger is coming to you!\u201dZhang Tie turned pale. \u201cI\u2019m in danger?\u201d\u201cTell me, have you provoked some important figure?\u201d Donder asked genuinely.After thinking for a while, Zhang Tie recalled nobody but Glaze. \u201cAs for Mary, in the worst case scenario, she might fetch someone to beat me; however, it shouldn\u2019t make my heart pound.\u201d\u201cCould it be Glaze? It seems that I have not provoked anyone else other than Glaze\u2019s group!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure. Sometimes you don\u2019t know whom you have provoked; however, they still want to kill you. There are powerful diviners in the East who can figure out the origin of the unknown danger based on the time your Blood Sense or other relevant trivial symptoms that appeared. As a result, the danger could be avoided. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t!\u201d Donder shook his head. \u201cSince you know it\u2019s coming, you can only prepare for what\u2019s about to come!\u201dSaying this, Donder searched the drawers in the counter and took out two goods, giving them to Zhang Tie. \u201cI know you\u2019re going to take part in the survival training, so I\u2019ve prepared two gifts for you. They can help you deal with danger!\u201dZhang Tie realized that they were both \u201celite\u201d goods\u2014a vial of the purest \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d and a sheathed dagger. The blade of the dagger was very sharp; however, the most threatening part on it was not the sharp blade; instead, it was the handle which could send needles covered with snake poison towards the opponent. As a result, the person hit would be paralyzed and unable to move. The needle being sent out was so powerful that it could even penetrate through glass that was 1cm thick\u2026The two gifts were something that Zhang Tie definitely could not afford, but in the end, Zhang Tie did not reject them and finally accepted them.Seeing Zhang Tie receive them without any hesitation, Donder nodded\u2026While Zhang Tie stood in Donder\u2019s grocery store as he thought over the possible sources of the unknown dangers, Huck and Snade were standing in an alley near the railway station. Standing in front of them were more than twenty young beggars and wandering kids. Lining up, they each stared at the coins in Snade\u2019s hands. Each of them would take 10 coppers before tossing them into their pockets and quickly scatter in all directions. 10 copper coins might be a small amount of money for commoners; however, it was enough for these people at the bottom of society in Blackhot City to do many things. As these poor people were willing to do many things for just a piece of bread, they would naturally be pleased to search for people near the railway station since they would each receive 10 copper coins at least. Once they found their target, they would receive another 2 copper coins, totaling to 12 copper coins\u2026When they weren\u2019t able to find Zhang Tie after two days, Huck and Snade thought up this method. It was really hard for them to locate a person who\u2019s on the move in these streets that numbered around ten near the railway station of Blackhot City. Thus, from that Monday onwards, the two of them changed their strategy with the one suggested by Snade. They stopped searching around alone by themselves. Instead, they fetched a few young beggars and wandering kids to help them. They thought that Zhang Tie would easily be recognized by his black hair and eyes, which were common features among the members of the Chinese clan.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing those young beggars and wandering kids disappearing in the alley like a spreading fishing net, Snade showed a wisp of a smile.\u201cWould this method actually work?\u201d Huck panted. To the side, Snade impatiently pinched the joints of his fingers, causing sounds akin to exploding crackers. \u201cIn the past two days, they have found three wrong people\u2026\u201d\u201cI can feel that we will get that kid soon\u2026\u201d\u201cOnce he gives back it to us, I swear I\u2019ll pull out his heart and crush his head with my foot\u2026\u201d Huck said furiously.\u201cAs you will\u2026\u201d Snade narrowed his eyes as he stretched out his long tongue and licked his lips.

Much like the Iron Body Fruit, the seeds of the parasol trees on both sides of the streets of Blackhot City would soon be ripe as well.After leaving the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, as Zhang Tie walked on Bright Avenue, he suddenly felt a sharp pain, as something had fallen and hit his head. Squatting down, Zhang Tie picked up the object on the ground\u2014it was a parasol seed. Every May and June, all the parasol trees in Blackhot City would start to produce thorny seeds. After drying up, parasol seeds the size of walnuts would fall off the trees, spreading all over the sidewalk.On the way back home, under the light from the street lamps on both sides of the road, Zhang Tie picked up many parasol seeds and foisted them into his pockets.Zhang Tie intended to throw them all into the Castle of Black Iron. He was brimming with pleasure when he imagined that the land in the Castle of Black Iron would be covered with parasol trees in just a few years.Wednesday was the day of harvest. Although he had already ignited the Shrine burning point, he was only a bit more powerful than those rich kids, thus he still had to suffer from being beaten up in the Iron Thorns Fighting Club, and it would always take him two days to slightly recover from the excruciating pain each time. Only a few people would feel no pain after being beaten by a powerful opponent.It seemed that Benet had already become resentful towards Zhang Tie. Every time, he would always knock Zhang Tie down; however, Zhang Tie was as stubborn as a small blade of grass trampled upon by numerous people\u2014whenever he was knocked down, he would pick himself back up from the ground until Benet became exhausted. Rather than attributing it to his physique or his will, it was his positive attitude that allowed him to persevere, as attitude determined everything. For Zhang Tie, he simply considered all the pain as something that would help accelerate the growth of the Iron Body Fruit. Similar to his last name\u2014Tie, which meant \u201cIron\u201d\u2014like a red block of iron, he would not become fine steel without being repetitively tempered on an anvil.Zhang Tie appreciated each strike and each feeling of pain. When he experienced the effect of the first Leakless Fruit, he utterly realized how excellent that small tree was, causing him to greatly appreciate it. He also extended his sincere gratitude to the gods for giving him this opportunity to change his own life. He appreciated the Castle of Black Iron and the small tree gifted by the God. Zhang Tie knew that on the entire Kun\u2019ang Continent, there was no else that was as fortunate as him and no one else that was able to change the strikes inflicted on him into sweet fruits.Because of gratitude, Zhang Tie knew how to treasure it.Another day had passed, yet that unknown danger still hadn\u2019t arrived. Aside from losing his towel, which he had always used for the past three years to wipe his sweat and wash his face after training at school, after having placed it in his locker, nothing else happened. It was already old enough and even had some holes on it. Zhang Tie wondered who would be interested in that broken towel. Besides being a bit dejected, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t think too much about it.These days, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood discussed about how they would help Zhang Tie lose his virginity. It seemed that besides Zhang Tie, all the other horny students were talking about ending their own virginity, many of which had already taken action. Since the survival training would soon start, do you really want to die as a virgin? This slogan was much more effective than any other reasoning at the moment. Nobody, including Zhang Tie, wanted to keep their virginity. As the education system had separated the males from the females, the horny students could only seek help from a \u201cprofessional\u201d to solve this problem. It seemed that it had already become a tradition.So because of this, those prostitutes had good business on the last week of school. As dusk soon fell and the roadside lamps were lit, groups of horny male students from Blackhot City\u2019s twelve male middle schools appeared in this place which they rarely visited. At this time, all the small hotels in Blackhot City were filled with pimps and prostitutes.On his way home from Bright Avenue, Zhang Tie had already encountered several groups of these horny students. They appeared on the street in groups of two or three. They would always be looking around, and the moment they found the sexy prostitutes wandering under the light of the roadside lamps or the ones who stood on the sides of the street when dusk had fallen, they would pluck up their courage and stride forward. After idly chatting with them for a while, they would pull the hands of the one they fancied the most and would either disappear into the dark alleys or would head to a small hotel together.It\u2019s shameful to die as a virgin!That\u2019s why Zhang Tie also anticipated the ending of his virginity tomorrow after school. This benefit of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood provided by Fatty Barley was really attractive!According to the schedule, the first Iron Body Fruit would be ripe today!With one of his pockets filled with parasol seeds, Zhang Tie went back home excited. After finishing supper, Zhang Tie washed the bowls and the chopsticks as usual. The moment Zhang Tie prepared to chat with his dad and mom, his dad stealthily pulled him into the courtyard behind the kitchen. Before Zhang Tie opened his mouth, his dad tossed at least six or seven silver coins into his hands\u2026\u201cDad, what\u2019s this for\u2026\u201d Staring at the heavy silver coins, Zhang Tie was surprised\u2026\u201cShh\u2026\u201d His dad told him to lower his voice as he carefully looked at the door. At that moment, the voices of his mom and his soon-to-be sister-in-law drifted over. \u201cThese coins are your pocket money for this week. I have been saving them up secretly, so don\u2019t let your mom know\u2026\u201dZhang Tie scratched his head and was puzzled. \u201cDad, seven silver coins is too much. I don\u2019t need that much. Are you ok\u2026\u201dHis dad stretched out his hand and flicked away Zhang Tie\u2019s hand that had been placed on his forehead. He became a bit furious and glared at Zhang Tie. \u201cBoy, you should know that even though I am old now, I was also young before. Humph\u2026 humph\u2026 remember it. Choose the younger ladies with lustrous skin and eyes. They are healthier even though they would cost you one or two more silver coins\u2026\u201d his dad warned him, \u201cRemember, don\u2019t let your mom find out!\u201dAfter saying that, his dad made a coughing sound before showing his stern look once again. He then left the courtyard, leaving Zhang Tie standing in place as his mouth gaped while holding a handful of silver coins\u2026After quite a while, Zhang Tie finally figured out what his dad meant before forcefully gulping his saliva. \u201cAre you kidding me? Dad gives me money to sleep with whores\u2026 \u2018Choose younger ladies with lustrous skin and eyes. They are healthier even though they would cost you one or two more silver coins\u2026\u2019 That\u2019s really\u2026 really mother*cking great, dad!\u201dZhang Tie almost burst into tears from the actions of his dad. His dad was truly considerate.Because of what had just happened, whenever he spoke with the other family members at home, he would feel a bit weird. Thus, after tell his mom about the situation at school and how beautiful and comfortable the bathroom paved with mosaic in the fighting club was, Zhang Tie left.\u2026\u2026After washing his feet and brushing his teeth, Zhang Tie went back to his bedroom and entered the Castle of Black Iron.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!Whenever Zhang Tie read this line, he would always feel much better.These past few days, Zhang Tie had noticed something\u2014although nobody dug pits to sow seeds and nobody provided fertilizer for the seeds, the plants would still be rather vigorous everywhere. That meant that those seeds got along well with nature. The seeds with good quality would be able to survive by rooting themselves into the ground, while the seeds with bad quality would wither away. It would only take Zhang Tie a little bit of time to sow the crops. For the seeds of plants, he could just scatter them about. It was simple, convenient, and highly efficient. If they could survive in the wild, there was no reason for them to die here in the Castle of Black Iron. In addition, the conditions in the Castle of Black Iron seemed more suitable for plants to grow than that in the wild.After thinking it through, Zhang Tie broke the shells of those parasol seeds and scattered them about onto a patch of land in the east. Then, he walked over to that small tree.Similar to how it smelled when the Leakless Fruit was ripe, when Zhang Tie walked over to the small tree, the fragrance of a fresh fruit drifted towards him.At that moment, two cute fruits were hanging on the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree; one in red, and the other in silver.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Tie checked the Leakless Fruit first.\u2014\u201427 hours left before the Leakless Fruit becomes ripe!A line of words appeared in front of Zhang Tie and disappeared after a while. Zhang Tie grinned. \u201cOne Leakless Fruit a week\u2014life with the Leakless Fruit is truly marvelous.\u201d Then, Zhang Tie moved his eyes onto the diamond-shaped, silver-colored fruit that was slightly bigger than a walnut\u2014the Iron Body Fruit. When Zhang Tie put his hand over it, another line appeared.\u2014\u2014The Iron Body Fruit has become ripe. Usage: Pick and directly eat it. Notice: The fruit cannot be taken out of the Castle of Black Iron. After twelve hours of having been picked off the tree, its energy and vitality will gradually decline.Looking at that line of disappearing words, Zhang Tie smiled\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was slightly crunchy and had a fragrance similar to a peach that was not yet fully ripe. Afterwards, he waited for a while for the effects to manifest; however, nothing happened. He then waiting for another while, but nothing happened either\u2026After quite a while, Zhang Tie blinked a few times and had found that nothing had changed. \u201cThere really is a sharp difference between the effects of the Iron Body Fruit and the Leakless Fruit\u201d He felt slightly disappointed; however, in that split second, Zhang Tie realized that he might have been too greedy. As he got this fruit from only being beaten up by a kid for 4 times, the effects of the Iron Body Fruit could not be noticed right now without quantitative accumulation. Iron body\u2026 Iron body\u2026 Naturally, you can\u2019t have an iron body after having been beaten up only 4 times.Thinking in this way, Zhang Tie recovered his composure. After finishing the practice of <mental>and polishing the burning point at his tailbone, Zhang Tie fell asleep.</mental>At midnight, Zhang Tie woke up because of his growling stomach. Hurriedly sitting up, he grabbed several pieces of toilet paper from the head of his bed and locked on to the arched door in his mind, entering the Castle of Black Iron. With short breaths, he ran towards a corner in the Castle of Black Iron. Covering his stomach, he was only able to run a few dozen steps before he could no longer hold it in. He then immediately took off his pants and squatted. The moment he squatted, he cooly excreted the waste in his bowels, which smelt particularly bad. After more than ten minutes, Zhang Tie felt that he had discharged all the messy things from the insides his stomach. After cleaning his butt, Zhang Tie stared at that \u201cpolluted\u201d place as he frowned. At the same time, he was startled by that black pile.F*ck, that was really disgusting. How did my sh*t turn black?That pile of sh*t smelled extremely terrible and looked disgusting. Thus, like a cat, Zhang Tie decided to cover his shit with soil.After looking around, Zhang Tie ran over to that small tree, which had a sundry box beside it. The \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d and the dagger gifted by Donder were stored inside the box in addition to a pile of sundries inside. Zhang Tie picked up a small shovel and ran back to that messy place. He then shoveled a pile of soil and covered the \u201cevidence\u201d. After doing that, Zhang Tie returned to his bed and fell asleep again.Zhang Tie faintly felt that his stomachache was related to the Iron Body Fruit; however, he didn\u2019t put much thought into it, as he didn\u2019t lose anything in the end. As for the other effects of the Iron Body Fruit, Zhang Tie thought that he would know about it sooner or later!That night, Zhang Tie slept dreamlessly. When Zhang Tie woke up again, although the pain and the soreness of his body had greatly lessened, he felt no other special changes. His underwear was still dry and cold, and his p*nis was still erect and hard.Zhang Tie decided not to worry about the matter regarding the Iron Body Fruit anymore. When it came to mind that today would be his \u201cheyday\u201d, Zhang excitedly got up immediately and began the start of his new day.\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie entered school in the cleanest clothes he had and in the new leather shoes gifted by his elder brother. What waited for Zhang Tie was not admiration; instead, he was met with all sorts of jokes, looks of ridicule, and gossiping from the bastards in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood.\u201cHey\u2026 Hey\u2026 You\u2019re well prepared!\u201d Fatty Barley came over to Zhang Tie with an obscene smile after class. \u201cYou look much cleaner and fresher than you usually are. A fresher virgin may be well welcomed by women. You may be gifted with a surprise~\u201dRight when Zhang Tie was pretending to punch Barley in the face, he heard the word 'surprise\u201d, causing his hormones to immediately rise up rapidly. \u201cWhat surprise?\u201d Zhang Tie asked the Fatty curiously.Barley smiled obscenely. However, before he was able to answer, Hista, the evilest guy in the brotherhood, had already wrapped his arm around Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder and whispered something to Zhang Tie, making him really excited\u2026\u2026\u2026Could a virgin concentrate on listening to lessons on the very day when he would end his virginity after having endured for more than ten years? At the very least, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t. Most of the horny students in the class weren\u2019t in the mood for lessons as well; instead of paying attention, most of them were busy asking the teacher for their signature, as after tomorrow, they would have to say farewell to this classroom. Because of this, most classes in the final two days completely became classes where the students would ask for signatures from their teachers, and Miss Daina obviously had the most fans. Classmates also sought signature from each other. Early in the morning, Zhang Tie had already written down his blessings for many of his classmates.Although nobody would admit it, everybody felt somewhat dejected over having to leave school. Every one of them wanted to leave something behind, as none of them knew how many among them would lose their lives during the survival training and would be forgotten by the others after several years.The training class in the afternoon was their final class at this school. In the last training class, the instructor only talked about one topic\u2014the usage of the long-handled weapon in wild training and how to hunt several common animals with long-handled weapons through teamwork. The instructor\u2019s implications were very obvious. For these green birds, they had to cooperate with each other as they used long-handled weapons like pikes and spears to keep a distance between them and the enemy. This was a critical rule for the training in the wild.Finally, class was over. Outside the school gates, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood also bade farewell to Zhang Tie like what they did to Doug last time.\u201cHope you will be a real man when we see you tomorrow!\u201d Bagdad gave his blessings.\u201cEnjoy it!\u201d Sharwin added.\u201cYoung men are always ferocious for the first time. Once you can make her feel good, it will be possible to do it another five or six times!\u201d\u201cDo not keep those damned tea leaves in your mouth!\u201d Doug suggested.\u201cDon\u2019t forget how to stall time as I told you!\u201d Leit smiled obscenely.Zhang Tie had mixed feelings at that moment. He felt feelings of excitement and anxiety, and he also felt sadness since he could not easily see Miss Daina again.Finally, under Barley\u2019s urgency and those horny guys\u2019 whistles and laughter, Zhang Tie left with Barley and headed for the destination where he would end his virginity.\u201cThe same place that Doug had gone last time?\u201d Zhang Tie asked curiously on the way.\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Barley nodded. \u201cMiss Anna is a good instructor to guide you to be a real man\u2026\u201d\u201cI have to work in the grocery store today!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve already told me. I will go pick you up at the grocery store at 7 pm, and we will go look for Miss Anna together!\u201d\u201cFine!\u201d Zhang Tie didn\u2019t ask where Barley was heading to, as each man had his own secret.When they arrived at the first intersection at the railway station, Zhang Tie left Barley and headed for Donder\u2019s grocery store.At the sight of Zhang Tie, Donder\u2019s words almost made Zhang Tie fall down outside the grocery store. \u201cI remember you told me that you would not be a virgin soon. Judging from your clothes and the pair of new leather shoes, I guess it will happen tonight. Hey\u2026 Hey\u2026 Actually, I would understand if you told me it would happen tonight. There is an old saying in the Oriental Continent\u2014\u2018It\u2019s worth one thousand gold coins to sleep with the one you love\u2019. I won\u2019t be that unkind. How about imparting you with two techniques? I am sure the lady will be highly spirited when you use them!\u201d Donder smiled obscenely.The fatty\u2019s talent of observing others made Zhang Tie furious. His secret was revealed so easily, making Zhang Tie feel like he had lost face.\u201cYea, I will go for a woman two hours later to end my virginity. I heard that young men always performed ferociously for the first time, and they could even do it seven or eight times. Dear boss, how long has it been since you have not been able to do it seven or eight times in one night?\u201d Zhang Tie purposely patted his own forehead. \u201cOh, I almost forgot. At your age, you should just stay healthy since you are not suitable to do this anymore!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s harsh attack, Donder, who was drinking water, coughed heavily. As a result, the two glared at each other furiously for a while, just like two fighting cocks. Then, they harrumphed consecutively, turned away their heads respectively, and started doing their own jobs.Donder dealt with several transactions, while Zhang Tie settled the accounts. It might be because Zhang Tie had made him angry, but the narrow-minded man looked cold for two hours. During that period, he didn\u2019t say a single word to Zhang Tie. Whenever their eyes met, Donder would harrumph and turn his face away. Two hours later, that guy spoke stingily again, \u201cI will not provide you supper!\u201d Hearing this, Zhang Tie left.Walking out of the gate, Zhang Tie saw Barley greeting him on the other side of the street. In a split second, he felt his heart pounding again, more heavily this time. Zhang Tie then shook his head and that gloomy face of Glaze flashed away in his mind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMotherf*cker!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inside.\u2026\u2026In an alley nearby the railway station, Huck became gradually infuriated after having received no clues in the past week. Even Snade became anxious as he played his dagger. It was becoming closer to the final moment when the organization would take action. If they were still unable to contact that influential figure inside the Blackhot City within two days, they would fail this task and would have to escape as far away as possible\u2026The darkness fell again when a thin beggar ran into the alley.\u201cWe\u2019ve found a person who meets your description\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After drinking some water, he walked on the way together with Barley, just like the way they had previously accompanied Doug.On the way, Fatty Barley constantly told Zhang Tie about what he had to pay attention to. \u201cIf you eat too much, you will not perform well, and neither would you if you were hungry. Later, when you see Miss Anna, you\u2019d better pretend to be slightly bashful. According to my observations, that woman seems to like conquering bashful boys, especially virgins!\u201d\u201cBashful, how?\u201d Zhang Tie asked while looking a bit nervous.Barley glanced at Zhang Tie. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to pretend, she will know you are a virgin at first sight!\u201d\u201cF*ck!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inside.\u201cHow do you know that\u2026 that\u2026 Miss Anna?\u201d Zhang Tie asked curiously.\u201cWhen I was 12, my dad took me to visit a friend\u2019s home, and that\u2019s where I got acquainted with her. Ever since the first time I saw her, I had been attracted to her plump breasts. She was really sexy and started to seduce me the instant she saw me\u2026!\u201d Barley said frankly.Visited her at the age of 12? Zhang Tie became puzzled.\u201cIs she married?\u201d\u201cNope, Miss Anna was a mistress of a man who was a middle-class official in the Department of Goods in Blackhot City. Soon after he saw her for the first time, her lover was arrested. Do you remember that Great Train Robbery that happened several years ago? Her lover was arrested because of that event\u2026\u201dThe Great Train Robbery was a bloody robbery that shocked the whole Andaman Alliance and had occurred when Zhang Tie was in preliminary school. At that time, a train filled with many valuable materials was being transported outside of Blackhot City, heading for the manufacturing center of Andaman Alliance\u2014\u2014Kalur, the city of machines. However, it was robbed by the Red-Scarf Burglars on the way, and as a result, there was nothing left on the train. Additionally, the driver, a detachment of soldiers on the train, and as well as several unfortunate workers were murdered. Ever since that incident, the Red-Scarf Burglars had been wanted across Blackhot City.\u201cHow is that incident related to her lover?\u201d Zhang Tie was surprised.\u201cOf course, I was also confused at first. However, when I came back late after school, I saw Miss Anna applying makeup to herself while she stood under the roadside lamps. When I came back home, I asked my dad why and he told me that her lover was arrested for disclosing secrets of some of the goods in the train. It was reasonable to arrest him\u2026\u201d Fatty Barley cursed while walking along with Zhang Tie. This story was really interesting to Zhang Tie.\u201cWhat then?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s so alluring that I couldn\u2019t stand anymore, so one day, I stole some of my dad\u2019s money and helped her!\u201d\u201cHelp?\u201d Zhang Tie stared at Barley curiously. However, that guy was not bashful in the least.\u201cOf course, I helped her with either money or my body. Try to imagine how lonely and helpless she is without her lover. In every aspect, she definitely needs the comfort and help from a man. And as I could meet her demands, I used my innocent body and spent all the money I could get for her!\u201d Barley explained shamelessly.Zhang Tie became speechless as he had noticed another trait of Fatty\u2014shameless, endlessly shameless! How could he explain something like sleeping with a whore to be such a holy and righteous act? This was the first time Zhang Tie had heard such a ridiculous theory.Zhang Tie knew that there were some apologists and hypocrites that would criticize seeking a whore as a morally degenerate and filthy behavior; however, there were also shameless guys like Barley who would glorify it as a beautiful deed to help the unprivileged. For Zhang Tie, this was neither holy nor indecent; it was just like the trades that happened in Donder\u2019s grocery store\u2014there was a need. A woman needed money to survive, while a man needed to complete his coming-of-age ceremony. Nobody got hurt, and IOUs didn\u2019t exist. What was more, Zhang Tie thought that he was neither an apologist nor a righteous man or swordsman that might exist somewhere at a given point in time. Zhang Tie could not change what happened to her before, and neither should he assume responsibilities for sleeping with her in the future. Each man had his own story. Today, he needed a woman\u2019s help to become a real man. That was it!\u201cTake this\u2026\u201d Barley gave him a small paper parcel. \u201cThis should work if you\u2019re not as stupid as Doug!\u201dAfter thinking for a while, Zhang Tie took that paper parcel and opened it. Taking out three tea leaves, he put them inside his mouth and smacked his lips. \u201cIt tastes like nothing special!\u201dThis was the first time Zhang Tie had eaten tea leaves to freshen his mouth.By the time they stood in front of the same door that Doug had previously stood at, darkness had already fallen and the alley looked much darker. Perhaps it was because of his excessive male hormones, but Zhang Tie was excited.Spitting out the three tea leaves, he took a deep breath under Barley\u2019s encouraging stare. \u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201d He knocked on the door and waited peacefully. Zhang Tie began to hallucinate about Miss Anna\u2019s sexy figure and her sexy expression as his heart started to pound. He became breathless, and his erect p*nis stood up once again, forcing him to have to toss one hand into his pocket and press down on that wild thing.A little bit of lamp light penetrated from behind the door. Before Zhang Tie knocked on the door for the second time, the sound of footsteps drifted over. Hearing the footsteps, Zhang Tie became even more breathless and started to peep through the cracks of the door\u2026When the door opened, the frowning face of a woman above the age of 50 with gray hair appeared in front of Zhang Tie. The old woman stood in front of Zhang Tie and Barley with a grin. Her front row of silver teeth scared Zhang Tie, causing him to take a few steps back. Never would he have thought that this fantasies of the 'surprise\u201d would turn into a \u201cfrightening shock\u201d. At this moment, his p*nis shrunk\u2026\u201cCome on in!\u201d the old woman uttered\u2026Zhang Tie turned pale and stared at Barley. Zhang Tie swore inside that he would definitely beat up Fatty Barley if this was Miss Anna, even at the risk of exposing his real strength\u2026\u201cShe\u2019s Miss Anna\u2019s servant!\u201d Fatty explained. Hearing that, Zhang Tie felt reassured. \u201cWhere\u2019s Miss Anna?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s inside\u2026\u201d the servant replied and closed the door. Barley then went inside with Zhang Tie.The house was not large, but it was well cleaned. When they passed through the door, they saw a passageway and a guest room, which looked really comfortable and warm. The whole house was filled with a slight scent of a woman. Smelling this, Zhang Tie\u2019s p*nis became as hard as fine steel once again.Waiting in the guest room, Zhang Tie found Miss Anna coming out of the washroom as she dried her crimson-red hair; she seemed to have just taken a bath. Miss Anna was wearing a pair of sandals and translucent lace camis that just barely covered her butt. She was thin and tall and had plump breasts and a plump butt. Although she was not extremely beautiful, she still looked enchanting and seductive, especially her pair of watery eyes. Once his eyes fell upon that woman, Zhang Tie was no longer able to avert his eyes. Consequently, the blood all over his body rushed towards his p*nis\u2026Hidden under her translucent lace camis, her body appeared under the light of the lamps in the guest room. Her snow-white thighs were exposed, and the graceful curves hidden under the pajamas almost drove Zhang Tie mad. Her breasts especially stood out. Zhang Tie swore that they were definitely larger than Miss Daina\u2019s. Droplets of water from her hair fell onto her breasts, causing the thin camis to become even more translucent as her breasts stuck more tightly to it. Besides the seductive plump breasts, the two purplish grapes also loomed.Without needing to say a word, Barley pointed at Zhang Tie, and in response, Miss Anna showed an enchanting smile that made Zhang Tie dazed as he instantly mistook this woman for Miss Daina.Miss Anna walked over and held Zhang Tie\u2019s hand while he was still nervous and gaping. After kissing him gently on his face, she pulled Zhang Tie into her bedroom.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSmelling the fragrance of that mature woman, Zhang Tie became more nervous and slow-witted. Before entering the bedroom, Zhang Tie anxiously looked back at Barley, only to see Barley clasping his fist in encouragement.The door to the bedroom was closed by Miss Anna as she pulled Zhang Tie towards the huge bed with a pink mosquito net. At that moment, Zhang Tie felt like he was in a wet dream.\u201cCome on, baby. Apply some rose essence on your auntie\u2026\u201d Miss Anna took out a fine glass bottle containing a dark-red liquid. She passed it to Zhang Tie and gave him a fascinating smile as she slightly undid the straps of her camis. Immediately, a charming, naked female body was lazily lying in front of Zhang Tie \u2026At that moment, Zhang Tie was in a daze. Her naked body was truly stimulating. Zhang Tie forcefully swallowed his saliva and moved two steps forward. Seeing Miss Anna staring at his high rising tent and her bashful smile as she rested her face on her hand, Zhang Tie felt all the blood rushing to his head and immediately charged at her\u2026\u201cSlower, baby, ah\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After a while, he heard various strange sounds and the gentle laughters of Miss Anna. More than ten minutes later, a miserable cry drifted over, almost frightening Barley who was drinking water. Barley thought that it might have been Zhang Tie\u2019s cry. Then, the bedroom became silent for a while. Several minutes later, another miserable cry was heard again. Barley heard it clearly this time and it truly came from Zhang Tie.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d Barley curiously stared at the bedroom. He knew that Miss Anna had no special hobbies and she was the best teacher for virgin boys. How come Bighead cried so miserably?After the second miserable cry, no more sounds were heard from the bedroom. 5 or 6 minutes later, Barley saw Zhang Tie dejectedly walking out of the bedroom with a pale face. Lowering his head, Zhang Tie pulled Barley\u2019s arm and ran outside without saying a single word.They didn\u2019t slow down until they were 100 meters away from Miss Anna\u2019s home\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s happening, Bighead? Why were you crying so miserably?\u201d Fatty Barley asked while gasping.Zhang Tie looked frustrated. He opened his mouth wanting to say something, but he didn\u2019t say anything in the end. Only under the insistence of Barley\u2019s repeated questions did Zhang Tie reluctantly pour out his secret quietly\u2026\u201cMy d*ck\u2026 expanded too much. It was similar unsheathing a sword, but it was difficult to pull it out. I have tried to \u2018unsheathe\u2019 it twice, but it almost tore off the \u2018sheath\u2019 before being fully \u2018unsheathed\u2019.\u2026\u201cDid you have the same feeling when you slept with her for the first time? Was it utterly different from that in dream?\u201d Zhang Tie asked Barley unconfidently.Hearing what Zhang Tie said, Barley gaped. Although he wanted to freely laugh loudly, he solemnly suggested, \u201cBro, it\u2019s nothing serious. You should get circumcised when you have time\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026It seemed that Zhang Tie\u2019s plan to end his virgin status absolutely failed. Thinking of that disastrous defeat, Zhang Tie was fully frustrated.\u201cCircumcise? F*ck! Nobody has told me about that. It seemed that I didn\u2019t have that problem when \u201cfighting\u201d Miss Daina in the dream. How come I couldn\u2019t stand it when in a real \u2018fight\u2019? It seemed that my good reputation would be ruined today.\u201d Zhang Tie was willing to bet that Barley, that talkative guy, would definitely spread this awkward matter among the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood tomorrow.\u201cBro, why are you so unhappy? Tell us, so we\u2019ll be happy. Hahaha\u2026\u201d Whenever Zhang Tie thought of the bad traits of the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, he saw no bright future.At that moment, Zhang Tie saw the two crescents hanging in the sky, seemingly giving off a smile of ridicule. After separating from Barley, Zhang Tie stepped on to the road back home gloomily while casually kicking cobblestones on his way home.Unconsciously, Zhang Tie moved onto a less populated path\u2026\u201cBang.\u201d Zhang Tie had walked into someone. \u201cAh, sorry\u2026\u201dHe had walked into a huge figure. After apologizing, Zhang Tie raised his face and saw a familiar, evil face. As his two hands clasped around Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders like a pair of iron pincers, he said, \u201cI finally found you, boy\u2026\u201dThe face looked slightly familiar. The moment Zhang Tie wanted to open his mouth, he felt a sharp pain at the back of his head as everything turned pitch black\u2014he had lost consciousness\u2026\u2026Feeling a cold sensation as cold water had been poured on his face, Zhang Tie opened his eyes. He then saw two ugly faces through the flickering of the lamp lights, giving off an expression as if they wanted to eat him. A cold feeling could be felt as he realized the snake-like man had already placed a dagger at his throat.\u201cBoy, I can easily cut through your windpipe before you can even shout. Try it if you don\u2019t believe me. If I\u2019m clear, nod once. Afterwards, we can have a good conversation!\u201d Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know why, but he was almost more calm when facing dangers. At that moment, Zhang Tie\u2019s mind was as clear as a crystal. Hearing the man\u2019s suggestion, Zhang Tie immediately thought of four pieces of useful information in his mind:.The first piece of information: The man with the dagger is preventing him from shouting, which meant that this place was not very far from populated areas.The second piece of information: Since his fate was in their hands, and they didn\u2019t seem to care about killing him, he needed to speak carefully.The third piece of information: He had met them last Thursday when he had walked into the manly guy called Huck. In the end, he picked up a wooden plate. Since they are looking for him, it must be related to that wooden plate. It seems that although that wooden plate was useless to him, it was very important to them, thus the wooden plate would determine Zhang Tie\u2019s life or death.The fourth piece of information: Since the two of them have captured him, this means that they are not afraid of being recognized by Zhang Tie. And since they don\u2019t care about the troubles from the magistrates, then it seems that they have made preparations to ensure that Zhang Tie wouldn\u2019t be a threat. They must have made one of the following two decisions: First, they will take the wooden plate and leave Blackhot City; Second, kill him directly. Only having chosen one of those two options would they be this confident\u2026As the icy dagger stuck close to his throat, the faint smell of blood immediately allowed Zhang Tie to determine their final decision. As he oozed sweat all over his body, Zhang Tie knew that he was faced with the greatest crisis in his life\u2026All those thoughts flashed in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind in a single second. Then, Zhang Tie nodded\u2026Soon after, the dagger was moved away; however, the icy edge caused goosebumps to appear on the skin on Zhang Tie\u2019s neck.\u201cI remember you! We met last Thursday!\u201d Before the two were able to open their mouths, Zhang Tie had forced himself to calm down and started the conversation, causing Huck and Snade to be stunned simultaneously.Huck and Snade stared at each other silently.\u201cVery good, boy! Since you remember us, let\u2019s not talk nonsense! Give that wooden plate back to us!\u201d Snade forced a smile within a split second as he immediately put away his dagger. \u201cThat plate is very important to us, so give it back right now. If you do so, then we\u2019ll both benefit!\u201d\u201cCan I sit up?\u201d Zhang Tie asked.\u201cHeh\u2026 Heh\u2026\u201d Huck smiled viciously as he stretched out his hands and yanked Zhang Tie up to his feet. He then pushed Zhang Tie into a chair. The moment Zhang Tie sat up, he noticed that all his personal belongs had been searched through by the two and were spread over the desk. It seemed that the two had only woken Zhang Tie up when they found nothing. If Zhang Tie brought the plate with him, he might have already been a corpse by now.Looking around, Zhang Tie realized he was in a bedroom with no windows. Around him were various common appliances that were cheap and clean. He could hear faint human voices from outside. Glancing over this bedroom, Zhang Tie instantly remembered those hotels especially used by the pioneers in Blackhot City. Due to the living habits for pioneers that drew them to secrecy and safety, none of the hotels for pioneers had windows, thus they felt like secret rooms. This room had most of the features one would find in a pioneer\u2019s hotel room.\u201cI don\u2019t remember taking your thing\u2026\u201d Hearing his words, Huck and Snade\u2019s faces twisted at the same time. However, before the two were able to beat him up, Zhang Tie immediately added, \u201cThat day I walked into you\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie then pointed at Huck. \u201cAfter you left, I found a small cloth bag on the ground, and when I opened it, I found a common, triangular piece of wood. I wonder whether you are looking for that?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThat piece of wood is very important to us. If you can hand it back to us, you will get 10 gold coins as a reward\u2026\u201d Snade gave a kind smile. \u201cCan you tell us where you put it?\u201d\u201cNobody would trust you!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inside. Putting on a greedy look, Zhang Tie forcefully swallowed his saliva as he looked at Snade. \u201c10 gold coins? Are you cheating me? I just f*cked a woman for 4 silver coins today. If I had 10 gold coins, I could f*ck 200 women\u2026\u201d\u201cHow could I cheat you? Take a look\u2026\u201d As he said this, Snade took out his purse from his coat, opening it and pouring out dozens of gold coins into his hands immediately.. Seeing those glittering coins, Zhang Tie gaped. At this moment, he was not pretending; ever since he was born, he had truly never seen so many gold coins.Zhang Tie stretched out his hand to take them, but the gold coins were retracted at the same time. \u201cYou still haven\u2019t told me where you have put it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s at my house. If you let me go, I\u2019ll go and bring it back to you. Since I found it useless when I returned home that night, I had casually thrown it into my nephew\u2019s bunch of building blocks!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Hearing his words, Snade gazed at Zhang Tie\u2019s face for a long while. He seemed as if he was trying to see through something, but Zhang Tie simply pretended as if he saw nothing. With eyes staring at Snade\u2019s purse, Zhang Tie swallowed his saliva forcefully.\u201cHow about we accompany you back home? If we let you go, it would be difficult for us to find you again. We are just common pioneers. Since we are new to Blackhot City, we are not familiar with the roads!\u201d Gazing at Zhang Tie, Snade explained kindly.Zhang Tie pretended to considerate it. \u201cFine! But you have to pay me 3\u2026 No, 5 gold coins as an advanced payment. After all, I picked that thing up for you. If you want it back, you have to, more or less, pay me as a reward\u2026\u201dSnade then gave Huck a look. Zhang Tie could tell that during their exchange, they had exchanged a cruel message from their looks. Aside from that, the corner of Huck\u2019s mouth rose from the terrifying message, showing disdain towards Zhang Tie\u2019s ignorance of the situation.\u201cAlright, lead the way!\u201d In a split second, five gold coins were thrown into Zhang Tie\u2019s hand. Zhang Tie clasped them instantly and hurriedly tossed them into his pocket. He then pointed at his belongings on the table. \u201cCould you please give them back to me?\u201d\u201cOf course\u2026\u201dAs Zhang Tie had expected, they were in a large hotel for pioneers which was close to the edge of the upper eastern region of Blackhot City that neighbored the railway station. Huck and Snade had chosen a remote independent suite. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know how they had carried him inside. As pioneers always had bad temperaments and had weird behaviors, there were many taboos among them. Given Huck\u2019s exaggerated figure and strength, once he hid Zhang Tie inside a bag and carried him with on his back while wearing a cloak, nobody would doubt that there was a man inside. When Zhang Tie was carried inside, he was still in a coma; however, when he went out, Snade let Zhang Tie put on a cloak and a hat to slightly cover his face. Thus, Zhang Tie left the hotel with Huck and Snade, shoulder in shoulder as if they were bosom friends. Naturally, nobody else spared them a glance, as there were always people from all walks of life that wandered around here.Treating him as if he was a bosom friend, Snade stretched out his right hand and placed it on Zhang Tie\u2019s neck, causing Zhang Tie to cry inwardly. Rather than it being a hand over his neck, Zhang Tie felt like it was a poisonous snake who would spit out its tongue. With a casual bite, the poisonous snake would be able to easily kill him. Snade gave off a disgusting and fishy smell. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know when the dagger would appear in Snade\u2019s hand and cut through his neck as it ended his life. Before the two of them, even though Zhang Tie was already a LV 1 fighter, he still felt as powerless as a baby. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know whether they were LV 6 or LV 7; he only knew that they could kill him easily, thus he didn\u2019t have any hope of being able to fight against them. If he wanted to survive tonight, he had to make other decisions.\u201cSince we are new to Blackhot City, we have been feeling rather tense, so we may end up hurting others to protect ourselves. So, no matter who we meet, could you please not make us nervous? This will benefit all of us,\u201d Snade told Zhang Tie kindly as they walked out of the hotel.Zhang Tie nodded, yet his brain spun rapidly.It was almost 9pm, only a few more hours before the curfew was in effect, thus there were currently numerous people on the street. Zhang Tie and Snade looked very close as they walked shoulder to shoulder with Huck following behind. They were currently heading for Zhang Tie\u2019s \u201chome\u201d. On the way, they had met two groups of the guards from the City Guard Army. Zhang Tie knew that City Guard Army could not save him, so he didn\u2019t do anything to arouse their attention. In addition, he was really scared of encountering people whom he was acquainted with. Once that happened, it was very possible for him to lose his life tonight. Fortunately, that didn\u2019t happen. After passing by two groups of city guards from the City Guard Army, Zhang Tie felt that Snade and Huck were no longer alert. The atmosphere among the three was also relaxed.\u201cThat piece of wood is just made of common red pine, so why is it so important to you?\u201d Zhang Tie asked Snade as if they were bosom friends.\u201cYou know for pioneers like us, sometimes we need to trade and contact others. That piece of red pine is our token. Since the grains and the quality of the material are quite distinct, we will always split the piece of red pine in half. When the two halves have matching grains, then it means we have found the correct person. When we get that piece of wood, we can finish our task and leave. You are really a lucky dog to get 10 gold coins so easily\u2026\u201d Snade answered in a relaxed way.Hearing his words, Zhang Tie finally understood what that piece of red pine wood was used for. He guessed that the two were here to look for someone and had taken that half of red pine as a token, but they had unexpectedly lost it. Therefore, they hurriedly searched for him as he might be the very person who had seen that piece of wood.\u201cYou know, I am really sorry. If I didn\u2019t walk into you, you wouldn\u2019t have lost your thing. How about taking only 8 gold coins?\u201d Zhang Tie said bashfully.\u201cWe\u2019ve already made the deal, so we will give you 10. You are fortunate. It\u2019s our fault, so we\u2019ll pay the price\u2026\u201d\u201cHoho, thank you. Those gold coins really help me a lot. My parents would never give me so much pocket money and would only give me 20 silver coins a week. I can only sleep with two women with it\u2026\u201d\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cHehhehhehheh\u2026\u201dThe two prattled with each other, truly giving off an image of bosom friends.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Snade suddenly asked when Zhang Tie was totally relaxed. Zhang Tie almost poured out his real name. However, he was very clear-minded tonight and had already made a plan to stay alive. Zhang Tie instantly replied:\u201cI\u2019m Du Shaofeng\u2026\u201d Soon after Zhang Tie spoke, he immediately covered his mouth with a hand and stared at Snade in a hasty manner. It seemed as if he had made a mistake and had carelessly disclosed a secret. At the same time, a pleasant look flashed in Snade\u2019s eyes.\u201d The boy is still innocent.\u201dAfter more than 20 minutes of walking on a street in the upper eastern region of the city, they arrived at the residence area where Zhang Tie\u2019s \u201chome\u201d was located.\u201cYou wait here. I will go in and bring the thing to you,\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s heart pounded, though he seemed as if he was talking as usual.\u201cIs your home here?\u201d seeing the heavily-guarded residence ablaze with lights and the two rows of fully-armored City Guard Army standing outside the gate, Snade and Huck asked dejectedly.\u201cYes, my brother is a military official in Blackhot City. This is the residence for the relatives of the City Guard Army officials, so of course we live here\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie replied, \u201cWe didn\u2019t live here before, but ever since my elder brother became an official, he got a house here. That\u2019s why we all moved here. Wait for a moment, I will bring it back to you soon!\u201dThe instant Zhang Tie wanted to move, Snade clasped onto him. A cold light flashed in Snade\u2019s eyes as he stared at Zhang Tie\u2019s face like a snake capturing its prey.\u201cAre you familiar with the guards over there?\u201d\u201cYes, I live in here, so of course we are acquainted with each other!\u201d\u201cThen, let\u2019s go in together!\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie forced a smile and said in a relaxed way, \u201cThe residence is strictly managed. As you two are new here, you cannot go inside directly. I will let the guard call my elder brother out so that he could lead us in. Come on, let\u2019s go look for him together\u2026\u201dSaying this, Zhang Tie moved one step forward\u2026The three then walked towards the gate of the community together. However, Zhang Tie\u2019s heart pounded. He felt his mouth was dry and his eyes were dazed. He felt like he was walking on a steel wire hanging in the air while under his feet was a bottomless chasm. Once the guards say they don\u2019t know Zhang Tie, he would be killed. Therefore, at that moment, Zhang Tie was betting with his life that Snade and Huck were more afraid of being exposed than he was. Zhang Tie felt that the two were extremely afraid of the City Guard Army of Blackhot City, as whenever they met the City Guard Army on the way, Zhang Tie could obviously feel that Snade would clasp him even harder. Common guards from the City Guard Army might be easily killed by these two; however, military officials of the City Guard Army in the Blackhot City were all above LV 5. As this was the residence for the relatives of military officials, there were a great number of great fighters inside, thus Zhang Tie didn\u2019t believe that the two would dare to go inside with him. Zhang Tie clearly knew that he might have a chance to survive tonight if they dared not go in with him. If he showed them where the wood was truly hidden, he would be killed. If they couldn\u2019t get their wood, they would kill him as well.He learned this from Donder as an apprentice during the past two years in the grocery store. When you give a despaired person a beacon of hope, you would get a beacon of hope when you felt despair. You should always make yourself useful to others. Don\u2019t be disposable. This was the key rule for the underprivileged when in trouble.If the two guys finally trusted him, they would try to let him in. Then, he could escape from the other gate of the community.The two rows of City Guard Army standing outside the gate of the community were becoming closer to them. Although Zhang Tie pretended to be calm, he was actually becoming increasingly reluctant to move forward. They were drawing closer and closer to those guards\u202660 steps\u202650 steps\u202640 steps\u202630 steps\u2026Seeing the three of them drawing closer, alert soldiers had already glanced at them. Finally, at about 20 steps away from those soldiers, Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder felt it being clasped even more tightly as Snade had already forced him to move away in a different direction.\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind\u2026\u201d Snade said, which made Zhang Tie relaxed immediately. \u201cWe pioneers don\u2019t like to deal with those uniformed workers since easy matters always become difficult when they\u2019re involved. Let\u2019s find another way!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s very easy!\u201d Zhang Tie explained in a confused manner, \u201cI will go in and bring it out for you, or you two can go inside with me and get it together\u2026\u201d\u201cSnade, I feel there is something wrong with the boy\u2026\u201d Huck said gloomily as Zhang Tie\u2019s heart pounded\u2026At a dark corner of the street, Snade glanced at Zhang Tie coldly. \u201cHuck, keep an eye on this guy. I will take a look around and see if what this boy is saying is true or not\u2026\u201dThe instant Snade left, Huck had already placed one hand onto Zhang Tie\u2019s neck. \u201cKid, I feel that something is wrong. Don\u2019t play tricks with me. If not, I will break your neck\u2026\u201dZhang Tie hurriedly nodded\u2026Ten minutes later, Snade came back and looked gloomy. \u201cLet\u2019s go back first\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLet me go. Give me two minutes and I will bring it back to you!\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201d Snade lowered his voice. At the same time, Huck pinched his neck with even more force, causing Zhang Tie\u2019s face to immediately turn purple\u2026\u201cKeep him alive. Let\u2019s go back and deal with him later\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026Then, the three of them returned to the hotel for pioneers faster than they had left. On the way back, Huck and Snade were both silent as they stared at Zhang Tie more fiercely and more viciously than before. As a result, Zhang Tie gradually became dejected. He knew that his plan had failed and the moment to determine his death or life was coming\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On the way back to the hotel, Zhang Tie realized that it was possible to lock onto the marvelous arched door between his eyebrows. That meant that once he was given a couple of seconds, he could disappear from their clutches and seek refuge in the Castle of Black Iron. However, once he did this, although he would be able to rid himself of the immediate danger, he could potentially bring a greater and more dangerous dilemma to his family. The secret of the Castle of Black Iron was something so great that once it was exposed, nobody related to him would be able to survive, be it his family, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, and perhaps even Donder. In the eyes of those great figures, the lives of dozens meant nothing when compared to the secret of the Castle of Black Iron.Returning to their room, they closed the door and Huck and Snade immediately showed their ruthlessness.\u201cBang!\u201d Zhang Tie was almost thrown onto the ground while his neck was still gripped by Huck. As a result, the bones all over his body almost broke, and as he couldn\u2019t stand the pain, he cried out miserably.\u201cQuiet! That might be heard by others!\u201d Snade told Huck. Hearing his words, Huck reluctantly pulled back his foot, which he had wanted to use to kick Zhang Tie. Squatting in front of Zhang Tie, Snade patted Zhang Tie\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cMy name is Du Shaofeng\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s your elder brother\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cDu Shaowu!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s his position in the City Guard Army of Blackhot City?\u201d\u201cMajor commander of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Regiment of the City Guard Army of Blackhot City\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie responded miserably, \u201cThat piece of wood was truly thrown to my nephew as a building block, I swear! Once you let me go back, I will bring it back to you. Why don\u2019t you trust me? I have suggested for you to enter with me, yet you refused! What do you want?\u201d\u201cWhere is your home?\u201d Snade ignored what Zhang Tie had said and continued.\u201cB301 in that community\u2026\u201dAfter asking the question, Snade fetched some dirty rags and a rope before he forcefully opened Zhang Tie\u2019s mouth and stuffed some rags into it, causing Zhang Tie to be unable to utter a single word. He then bound Zhang Tie\u2019s hands with the rope. Afterwards, Snade patted his palms and stood up. He said something to Huck before leaving, resulting in only Zhang Tie and Huck being left in the room. Zhang Tie struggled on the ground for a while. He knew where Snade was heading for; however, he wasn\u2019t afraid. Du Shaowu was his elder brother\u2019s superior. He had heard information about the Du Family when he chatted with his elder brother. Unless Snade has a picture of Du Shaofeng, he would never be able to discover that Zhang Tie was telling a lie.Half an hour later, Snade returned again.\u201cHow about it?\u201d Huck hurriedly asked as Snade closed the door from the inside.Snade looked really gloomy. \u201cIt took me 1 gold coin to verify that all the kid\u2019s words were true. There really is a major battalion commander by the name of Du Shaowu in the 3rd Battalion, 4th Regiment in the City Guard Army of Blackhot City. Du Shaowu has a younger brother called Du Shaofeng, who\u2019s as old as this kid. They live in B301 in that community. In addition, Du Shaowu has a 2-year son\u2026\u201dHearing Snade\u2019s words, Zhang Tie started to twist on the ground again.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! I feel there is something wrong with what he has said\u2026\u201d Huck said furiously, \u201cI should have kicked him to death!\u201d\u201cI have also felt that there was something off about him, but I couldn\u2019t figure it out. We have no other ways now. If the kid is still telling a lie, we have to kill him!\u201d saying this, Snade moved in front of Zhang Tie. Squatting down, he patted Zhang Tie\u2019s face with his hand before saying, \u201cI have known since the beginning that you might be cheating us. I simply wanted to see what tricks you would play. Do you know your mistake? When a man tells a lie, his heartbeat would speed up, causing the veins all over his body to pulse even more strongly, and their body temperature would also slightly increase. Earlier when I had wrapped my hand around your neck, I could figure out when you were telling a lie through your pulse and your body temperature. I could feel that you became most nervous when we were walking towards those soldiers. If you were telling the truth, then your heart then shouldn\u2019t have beat so quickly. You are smarter than most of the other kids at your age I have seen. Pitifully, you have met me!\u201dAs he said this, Snade pulled Zhang Tie\u2019s hair, ignoring how much he was struggling on the ground, and brought him into the washroom in the room while Huck followed behind.Entering the washroom, Snade\u2019s dagger suddenly appeared in his hand once again. With a chilly aura, Snade cut the rope on Zhang Tie\u2019s hands. He then stepped on Zhang Tie\u2019s left hand while he turned around Zhang Tie\u2019s right hand and placed it onto the toilet bowl. Afterwards, he placed his dagger onto the artery of Zhang Tie\u2019s right hand.\u201cYou have one last chance. Tell us where you hid the token!\u201d When Snade asked, he pulled out the rags from Zhang Tie\u2019s mouth.\u201cIt\u2019s in my elder brother\u2019s house. I really mean what I have told you! The reason I became nervous was because I was worried that you would kill me once you got that thing. I could feel that you two were having malicious thoughts and were trying to cheat me by exchanging for that thing with gold coins. Once you promise not to harm me, I will definitely bring that motherf*cking wooden plate back to you\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie seized the opportunity to explain. Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, Snade frowned and foisted the rags back into his mouth. Afterwards, Zhang Tie\u2019s right wrist felt cold. Following an excruciating pain, fresh red blood trickled down into the toilet bowl. The instant Zhang Tie wanted to struggle, his body had already been held by Huck, causing him to be unable to move in the least.The scene suddenly reminded Zhang Tie of how a butcher killed a pig. They bound the pig and poked it. He had found it funny when he saw people slaughter pigs; however, when he was the one slaughtered like a pig, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t find it funny at all. He now started to understand how the pigs thought when they were being slaughtered\u2026First he felt pain, then it was followed by weakness, and finally, he felt cold. As more and more blood had flowed out, he gradually became more afraid\u2026\u201cWe have already lost patience! We will give you several minutes to tell us the truth. Once you do that, we\u2019ll stop the bleeding and let you live\u2026\u201d Hearing the alluring words of Snade, Zhang Tie suddenly realized that how happy he was when he wasn\u2019t bleeding.Blood continued to trickle down into the toilet bowl from Zhang Tie\u2019s hand, turning the originally white toilet bowl into a pool of blood. Looking at the bloody toilet bowl, Zhang Tie suddenly remembered the topic that he and Donder were talking about, \u201cBlood Sense\u201d. He was truly amazed at how women didn\u2019t feel pain when they bled every month\u2026 At that moment, Zhang Tie started to admire women\u2026 Gradually, he felt cold and weak. He forced a smile and muttered inside, \u201cWhat mother*cking blood sense!? I really don\u2019t understand it at all, but I am curious\u2026\u201dTime slowly passed by as more and more blood trickled down from his right wrist.He then felt dazed and could hardly lock onto that arched door in his mind. \u201cShould I enter the Castle of Black Iron?\u201d Zhang Tie asked himself. He wished to survive a bit longer; however, he didn\u2019t want to bring a greater and more dangerous crisis to his family members and the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood.During that period, the rags inside Zhang Tie\u2019s mouth were pulled out one more time. Afterwards, Snade asked the same question, yet he received the same answer. Thus, the rags were stuffed back into Zhang Tie\u2019s mouth\u2026Zhang Tie started to think of his mom\u2019s plump shadow\u2026 the increasing white hair on his dad\u2019s head\u2026 the pair of leather shoes and the underwear gifted by his elder brother\u2026 and Fatty Barley\u2019s suggestion of getting circumcised\u2026\u201cF*ck! I haven\u2019t even been circumcised yet and am going to die a virgin. It truly is shameful to die as a virgin\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie felt that he was gradually losing his consciousness\u2026Looking at the young man\u2019s pale face and his miserable white lips, Snade started to have doubts. He had estimated that the body had already lost over 1800 ml of blood. \u201cIf we don\u2019t stop the bleeding, he will die soon. But, he still hasn\u2019t said anything. Were we wrong? Could it be that what he has told us was true? Was the boy actually nervous because he realized we were having malicious thoughts?\u201dAt this moment, Huck also stared at Snade. Since the two of them had worked together for many years now, Huck knew that the method Snade used had made many tough guys succumb to him. Very few people would simply wait for their death since it was much more miserable than just being immediately killed. Could this boy be tougher than those guys? Impossible! Otherwise\u2026 were the boy\u2019s words true?At that moment, Zhang Tie\u2019s body had completely turned limp by itself. He was no longer able to move. If Zhang Tie simply died in this way, then the two would have to escape tonight from being endlessly hunted down by their organization.Seeing the look in Huck\u2019s eyes, Snade also became frustrated. He cursed as he placed two fingers onto Zhang Tie\u2019s cut artery, \u201cF*ck! Just stop the bleeding first. Maybe\u2026 he was telling the truth\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWith the artery on his right wrist being pressed down, the blood stopped flowing out. At the same time, Zhang Tie saw a bright light before his eyes among the endless darkness. A line of words appeared in his mind:\u2014\u2014The Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree has detected that the body energy, Qi, and blood of the lord is approaching a dangerous, minimum level. Do you want to begin recovery and invert the flow of blood and Qi through the Leakless Fruit \uff1f\u2014\u2014Yes\u2026NoZhang Tie spent his last effort to click \u201cYes\u201d in his mind\u2026\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Snade then pressed Zhang Tie\u2019s artery as Huck fetched a strip of clean cloth and a vial. Opening the vial, Huck shook out some white powder onto the wounded wrist of Zhang Tie. Afterwards, he wrapped up the wound for Zhang Tie with the cloth strip quickly in a familiar motion as he discussed with Snade about their next course of action.\u201cIt seems that he was telling the truth. What will we do when he wakes up tomorrow?\u201d Huck asked impatiently. They never would have imagined that they had mistaken the kid and had almost killed him. Huck was somewhat afraid, as they would never get the token back if the kid was killed. If so, they would be killed as well.Looking at Zhang Tie, who was in a deep coma, Snade frowned. \u201cWe can\u2019t enter that community residence since it is 100 times more dangerous than that gang we swept. If we enter, we would be killed the instant the kid shouted out. We are not able to fight a major battalion commander like his elder brother, Du Shaofeng. According to the military traditions in Blackhot City, it\u2019s impossible to become a major without being at least LV8 or LV9. So, we should try to avoid meeting his family members and have him bring it back to us\u2026\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s too cunning! I swear he will betray us once he leaves!\u201d\u201cSo what do you have in plan?\u201d\u201cWe have to poison him and have him exchange the token for the antidote. If he\u2019s smart, he knows what to do\u2026\u201d\u201cGood! But will we give him the antidote?\u201d\u201cHeh, heh, we will kill him when we get the token and have ensured that he had not revealed it to other people. Since he has seen us, if he tells his elder brother about what had happened after getting the antidote, we will be screwed. That\u2019s why we have to kill him\u2026\u201d\u201cWe might be in trouble if we kill the kid since people in the hotel have seen us with the kid. His family would definitely be able to get that information through their rich connections!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why we should contact the Niumuen Merchants Group in Blackhot City as soon as we get the token and reach an agreement for that event as well as the time for action. Once that\u2019s out of the way, we will leave Blackhot City. One day after the kid has disappeared is enough time for us to complete our mission. By that time, his family members might not even have been able to respond to what had happened. After that\u2026 heh\u2026 heh\u2026 we will have to worry about nothing!\u201d\u201cOnce we succeed this time, Blackhot City would belong to us. And then we will definitely kill his elder brother, Du Shaowu, with the help of our Lord to prevent potential trouble\u2026\u201d Huck said viciously.After wrapping up the wound for Zhang Tie, the two checked his wound and ensured that it would no longer bleed. Thankfully, Zhang Tie\u2019s life had been temporarily saved. At that moment, Huck\u2019s belly made a \u201cgulugulu\u201d sound, reminding them that they had not yet eaten supper. Nobody could survive without food, no matter how great he was.\u201cYou go and buy some food from the hotel. I will go outside and prepare some things\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about the kid?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll return soon\u2026\u201d Snade stood up and stared at Zhang Tie, who was lying on the bed like a dead man. He then pressed and touched the spot by Zhang Tie\u2019s heart and smirked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about that kid. It would be amazing if he could wake up from the hemorrhagic shock tomorrow morning!\u201dAfterwards, the two left the bedroom and closed the door\u2026The instant the two left, Zhang Tie, who was supposed to be in a hemorrhagic shock from Snade\u2019s observations, opened his eyes. Actually, when the two carried him onto the bed, Zhang Tie had already recovered his consciousness. Although he could still not move, he could still perceive everything that was going around him, thus he had heard what Snade and Huck had said.Niumuen Merchants Group\u2026 Contact\u2026 Action\u2026 The alluring Blackhot City\u2026 Lord\u2026Zhang Tie felt cold all over. This time, he knew that he had gotten involved in a huge conspiracy against Blackhot City. Huck and Snade were just two trivial figures dispatched by an organization to contact the Niumuen Merchants Group in Blackhot City. That piece of red pine wood was the very token between the two and the Niumuen Merchants Group\u2026\u201cWhat should I do now? I need to recover my strength and survive tonight at first!\u201dZhang Tie smiled bitterly. He then closed his eyes again. He could feel something different from his head, spine, heart, and liver as a wisp of warm Qi was rising from those places\u2026Zhang Tie recovered consciousness through the first wisp of warm Qi rising from his head. He then could slowly controlled his movements and opened eyes through the second wisp of warm Qi rising from his spine. From the third wisp of warm Qi that rose from his heart and liver and spread to his organs, Zhang Tie could feel that he was quickly recovering his vitality\u2026Is this the result of the inverted flow of energy and qi and the blood regeneration from the Leakless Fruit? Zhang Tie tried to move his fingers and found that they could move.Zhang Tie realized that this might be his beacon of hope tonight. As Huck and Snade thought he was in a hemorrhagic shock, they would never have imagined that he was already quickly recovering\u2026He had to escape before the two returned!Zhang Tie was brimming with anxiety\u2026Within ten minutes, when Zhang Tie realized that he could sit up, he heard a series of heavy steps and the sound of someone opening the door. He then knew Huck that had returned, indicating that his escape plan would no longer work.Zhang Tie then became dejected once again.Be patient, patient, patient\u2026 Zhang Tie reminded himself. As long as he was patient enough, he would definitely find an opportunity. Closing his eyes again so that only a faint amount of light could be seen through the corners of his eyes, Zhang Tie began to observe what was going on in the room\u2026\u201cWell, just put food on it. I will take it in myself, you can go\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, enjoy\u2026\u201dAfterwards, a dining cart was pushed away and the door was opened as Huck entered with plates full of food on them. Instantly, the room was filled with the fragrance of food. After placing the food on the table, Huck walked towards the bed. Zhang Tie then fully closed his eyes and pretended to be relaxed. Huck put one finger under Zhang Tie\u2019s nose and confirmed that Zhang Tie was still breathing before turning around. At the same time, Zhang Tie slightly opened his eyes and observed the situation in the room through the corners of his eyes.Zhang Tie saw Huck walking towards those plates. The moment Huck picked up something, he suddenly thought of something. He then put it down and muttered something. Afterwards, he wandered in the room anxiously.\u201cF*ck, I never want to do this again\u2026\u201d Huck cursed.Snade also came back within 2 minutes.\u201cHow was it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve made the preparations. We will feed him the poison when he wakes up!\u201d\u201cFine, let\u2019s eat. I am so hungry!\u201dThe two then walked to the table. Zhang Tie saw Snade taking an object out and poking the food and the bottle of alcohol with it. After observing the object for a while, Snade uttered, \u201cIt\u2019s clean. We can eat it!\u201dHowever, less than 2 minutes since they started eating, the sounds of knocking drifted from outside. The man on the other side of the door shouted, \u201cMagistrate of Blackhot City, routine investigation. All registered persons, please come out\u2026\u201dInstantly, the doors opened and curses reverberated in the hall\u2026\u201cWhy so late? I had already fallen asleep!\u201d\u201cBuddy, what are you doing?\u201d Complaints were heard everywhere in the hotel.\u201cFriends, I\u2019m very sorry. Since some things have happened in Blackhot City recently, we have to do some security checks. As you might have heard, a couple of days ago, someone had set fire to a place near the railway station. It\u2019s said that there were dozens of bodies found from that incident. Because of that incident, the big figures were really shocked, and the magistrates are forced to do security checks. As it\u2019s almost time for the curfew, people who have registered at the hotel would be in big trouble if they\u2019re not in the hotel now. Therefore, simply show your face\u2026\u201d As the serviceman in the hotel explained what was happening loudly, those curses gradually disappear. Although those pioneers were defiant, they were not idiots. Nobody wanted to fight those guys in uniforms.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMotherf*cker\u2026\u201d After cursing, Huck and Snade stood up and walked outside the door.Hearing the door having been closed from outside, Zhang Tie opened his eyes immediately. Seeing the food and alcohol on the table, Zhang Tie suddenly thought up of a crazy idea. \u201cF*ck you, bastards, I don\u2019t care about what happens to you anyways\u2026\u201dBe quick!Zhang Tie closed his eyes and locked onto the arched door in his mind. In a split second, he disappeared from the room and entered the Castle of Black Iron\u2026\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I was almost slaughtered like a pig. Since you two didn\u2019t kill me, I will definitely kill you,\u201d Zhang Tie ruthlessly declared in his heart.Even though he felt very weak, he was still able to run. The moment he appeared in the Castle of Black Iron, he immediately ran towards the sundry box\u2026Inside the box were the two killing weapons gifted by Donder, the \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d and a dagger. Besides being matched with poisonous needles, the dagger\u2019s edge had also been quenched in snake poison and thus had the same amazing lethality.Although this was risky, Zhang Tie decided to give it a try.The distance between the place he had appeared in the Castle of Black Iron and the box were only a few steps apart; however, by the time he arrived before the box, Zhang Tie was already slightly panting and his hands and feet felt weak. He quickly took out the vial of \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d and the dagger from the box. Zhang Tie then squatted and took in two deep breaths. Afterwards, it took him more than 10 seconds to lock onto that arched door in his mind again.Exit!In the next moment, Zhang Tie reappeared in the bedroom, squatting on the bed.After having accessed the Castle of Black Iron over many days, Zhang Tie had noticed a reoccurring pattern when accessing it\u2014he will reappear exactly at the place where he had entered.It was still bustling outside. It seemed that the investigation won\u2019t be over very soon, thus Zhang Tie took in a few deep breaths and moved off the bed with the smallest and slightest strength he could muster. Bending his body, he stealthily moved in front of the pile of food. After glancing over where the cups and plates were placed, he then took out the \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d and opened the alcohol bottle deftly and rapidly before pouring in half of the \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d. He then spread the leftover \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d into the bowl of thick soup and slightly swirled the alcohol bottle and stirred the rich soup. Afterwards, he returned to his bed and threw the empty vial of \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d back into his pocket. He then pulled out of the dagger as he held it tightly under his body, pretending as if he had not awoken even for a moment\u2026 As Donder had told him that a dose of the \u201cpowerful rat poison\u201d was enough to kill 20 elephants, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t believe that Huck and Snade would be stronger than 20 elephants.Nervous, really nervous\u2026Closing his eyes again, Zhang Tie felt his heart pounding like a beating drum. He was extremely nervous and kept taking in deep breaths. Zhang Tie kept repeating in his mind\u2014easy, take it easy!Easy, take it easy!Easy, take it easy!\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie slowly calmed down in this way. Repeating this phrase in his heart, he was able to calm down. This was a useful method that was taught in school for occasions such as this.Zhang Tie then waited for Huck and Snade as if nothing had happened\u2026Huck and Snade stood outside the door coldly for about 3 minutes before the owner of the hotel came towards them with several magistrates. After checking the names they registered with and asking a few silly questions, they left. Afterwards, Huck and Snade stared at each other at the same time, as they had already figured out what the alleged investigation meant. Usually, the magistrates of Blackhot City preferred to slack off by capturing several hapless people. Nobody would have expected that the fatty magistrates would have already figured out what had truly happened in that fire.When the two returned to the bedroom, Zhang Tie had already been laying on the bed for a bit less than one minute. Everything remained unchanged in the room, and the food was still hot on the table, thus the two continued their meal.Huck drunk some alcohol, and Snade simply ate a bit of the rich soup.Laying on the bed, Zhang Tie glanced over them through the corner of his eye. When Huck chugged a large cup of alcohol, Zhang Tie gripped his dagger more tightly. As Snade was someone who would notice if he looked, he did not dare to look at him.Zhang Tie was very nervous. He was afraid that Snade wouldn\u2019t have eaten even a bit of the poisoned food by the time the poison took effect on Huck. However, after a few seconds, Zhang Tie became reassured when he saw Snade drink a large spoon of the rich soup, thus he held onto that dagger even more tightly\u2026One minute after Huck drunk the alcohol\u2026\u201cI feel a bit uncomfortable\u2026\u201d saying this, Huck\u2019s face suddenly turned black. He then inclined and fell backwards onto the ground from his chair.\u201cHuck!\u201d Snade exclaimed. At the same time, he also felt a bit uncomfortable and noticed that something was moving on the bed behind him.When Huck fell backwards, Zhang Tie had actually already fully opened his eyes. At that moment, Zhang Tie had slightly adjusted his posture so that he could use the dagger more easily.Although Zhang Tie tried his best to not make any noise, his movements were actually noticed by Snade. Turning around, Snade stared at Zhang Tie while Zhang Tie stared back at him. At that moment, he looked even more surprised than he did when Huck had fallen over. Instinctively, he pulled out his dagger and charged at Zhang Tie, stabbing it towards Zhang Tie\u2019s neck like how a poisonous snake would spit out its tongue\u2026Having been long prepared for Snade\u2019s attack, Zhang Tie only made one movement\u2014he rolled onto the ground from the bed, avoiding Snade\u2019s first strike\u2026Stabbing towards Zhang Tie, who was laying on the ground, Snade\u2019s face turned pale. He then slightly stopped and intended to throw his dagger at Zhang Tie; however, at the same time, Zhang Tie pressed the button on his dagger, releasing two poisonous needles that instantly shot into Snade\u2019s shank and thigh. The snake poison on the needles immediately paralyzed Snade all over, resulting in his hand remaining raised as he was no longer able to move. Zhang Tie then jumped up from the ground and fiercely stabbed Snade\u2019s heart with his dagger.Laying on the ground, Snade didn\u2019t die instantly. Instead, he gazed at Zhang Tie with his widened eyes as the corner of his mouth twitched. \u201cWh\u2026 why\u2026\u201dThere were so many questions in Snade\u2019s mind. He couldn\u2019t figure out how this young man, who should have been in a hemorrhagic shock, could recover in such a short period of time. He couldn\u2019t figure out where the dagger and the poison had come from. He clearly remembered that he had searched this young man all over and found nothing that stood out. Why? How did it end like this\u2026With widely opened eyes, Snade died with many unanswered questions.Kneeling on the ground, Zhang Tie panted for quite a while before he was able to slightly recover from the dizziness attributed to the lack of blood. The small tree in the Castle of Black Iron was not omnipotent; even now, he still has not fully recovered his strength, Qi, and blood. At that moment, Zhang Tie felt weak all over and had no strength at all, as he had exerted all his efforts just now. His forehead was covered in sweat, feeling as if he had just finished a 10 km run on the training ground at school. Over the past few minutes, he had experienced his most dangerous moment in his life yet.In the end, Zhang Tie survived, while Huck and Snade became corpses.Kneeling on the ground, Zhang Tie adjusted his breathing. He quickly wracked his brain on how to deal with their bodies. Zhang Tie knew that he had made a very dangerous decision, one which might tear him into pieces if he didn\u2019t deal with it carefully. Thus, Zhang Tie had to deal with it very carefully and not leave a single trace.Zhang Tie was thinking about how to deal with the weird scene in the room; lying on both sides of him were two bodies that had turned completely black, while he was kneeling on the ground like a sculpture. He remained still for quite a while. It was still noisy outside the door, as the magistrates haven\u2019t left the hotel yet.Three minutes later, after recovering a bit more, Zhang Tie picked himself up from the ground. After confirming that Huck was truly dead, he gave up on the idea of stabbing him once more. He then pulled Huck\u2019s body over and put it together with Snade\u2019s body. Afterwards, he searched every corner of the room and found their luggage. Several seconds later, lowering himself to hug Snade\u2019s dead body, Zhang Tie disappeared together with their luggage hung on his shoulders.1 minute later, Zhang Tie reappeared in the room. This time, he fetched a watertight cloak from their luggage and packaged all the food and tableware. Hanging the package on his arm, he went over to Huck, squatting as he hugged the body that weighed about 100 kg. More than 10 seconds later, Zhang Tie disappeared once again.This time, it took him longer than before. After more than 10 minutes, Zhang Tie tumbled and reappeared in the room with a pale face\u2026Back in the room, Zhang Tie had already changed his clothes. As Snade\u2019s figure was similar to his, Zhang Tie put on a suite of clothes from Snade\u2019s luggage along with a cold-protective hooded cloak which was usually worn by pioneers. After doing this, Zhang Tie glanced over the room.\u2014\u2014Flush the fresh blood in the toilet bowl. Clean his and Snade\u2019s blood using the towel in the toilet.\u2014\u2014Rearrange the chair lying on the ground.\u2014\u2014Arrange the bed well.\u2014\u2014Confirm that no evidence related to him, Huck, and Snade were left in the room.He even checked it over for the second time. Sometimes, Zhang Tie even felt that he himself was somewhat a lunatic. Finally, on his second check, he picked up several strands of black hair from the bed.Before leaving the room, Zhang Tie tossed the towel drenched in his blood into his pocket as he glanced over the room one last time. Actually, he made it even cleaner than what the servicemen usually does at the hotel. Like all hotels for pioneers, the guests paid before they lived in the room, thus the owner of the hotel would not feel anything out of place when the guests left without even bidding farewell.Nodding inwardly, Zhang Tie put on Snade\u2019s clothes and raised the hood of the cloak in hopes to avoid being identified by others. He then sped up and left the hotel. Without careful looking, most people in the hotel could only mistake Zhang Tie for Snade. For the others who didn\u2019t know what had happened, this was also the last trace of Snade in this world\u2026When he left, Zhang Tie glanced at the clock hanging in the hotel. It was 11:52, 8 minutes before the curfew\u2026The magistrates had just left. Everybody else found it normal to closely follow the magistrates out of the hotel like Zhang Tie, as they knew every pioneer was rather bold.Sneaking out of the hotel, Zhang Tie especially chose dim alleys and paths and found a dark corner about 200m away from the hotel. Taking off Snade\u2019s clothes and cloak, he threw them into a roadside trash can. The next morning, some lucky wanderer or beggar would receive a nice surprise.After throwing away those clothes, Zhang Tie wrapped the towel dyed in his blood around a rock and threw it into a smelly sewer on one side of the road. As a result, all evidence was eliminated. Zhang Tie then let out a sigh of relief.After doing all of this, Zhang Tie chose the avenues and streets without roadside lamps and stealthily walked towards home. In the meantime, he started to think of how he would answer his mom\u2019s questions when he got back, as this was the first time he has returned home after midnight.\u2026\u2026\u201cStop!\u201d A gloomy order drifted over. It really frightened Zhang Tie, as he was walking around a corner stealthily. A squad of patrolling soldiers shone their lanterns onto Zhang Tie\u2019s face, directly revealing him. Due to the strong light from the lamps, Zhang Tie wasn\u2019t even able to open his eyes. Hearing the safety wires of the bows being pulled on in the surrounding darkness, Zhang Tie hurriedly raised his hands and stayed still.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d A captain of about 20 years old walked towards Zhang Tie coldly with his right hand on the sword handle over his waist. Being alert, he didn\u2019t become relaxed until he saw clearly that Zhang Tie, who looked slightly pale, didn\u2019t carry a weapon with him.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 going home!\u201d Zhang Tie stammered. In a split second, Zhang Tie found that he had already been surrounded by more than ten soldiers. Facing the bows in their hands, Zhang Tie did not dare to make the slightest movement. He had just escaped from Huck and Snade, and it would be really motherf*cking unworth it to be killed by those average soldiers here.\u201cGoing back home? Why are you so late?\u201d the young captain continued.\u201cI\u2026 I played outside today and forgot the time!\u201d\u201cWhere do you live?\u201dZhang Tie told him his home address\u2026\u201cAre you still in school?\u201d\u201cYes. Tomorrow is the last day!\u201d\u201cI remember that block is close to Ninth National Male Middle School!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m from Seventh National Male Middle School!\u201d\u201cAh, yes. Has Mr. Fiore the biology teacher been well?\u201d\u201cMiss Daina is the one who taught us biology. Mr. Fiore taught us law!\u201dHearing the last answer of Zhang Tie, the captain showed a smile and raised his hand. Seeing his response, the other soldiers put away their weapons, alleviating the tension in the surrounding air.\u201cLeader, is this kid your schoolmate?\u201d a soldier asked.Zhang Tie stared at this captain of the City Guard Army of Blackhot City in surprise. He really didn\u2019t think that this man had also graduated from Seventh National Male Middle School.\u201cI\u2019m Joy. I have also graduated from Seventh National Male Middle School. It\u2019s already past the curfew, why are you so late?\u201d\u201cErm\u2026 I played\u2026 too much\u2026 outside and lost track of the time!\u201dSeeing Zhang Tie\u2019s pale face, his unsteady body, and his staggering tone, Joy understood it immediately, and so did the other soldiers. Thus, all of them laughed out loudly, as they had already captured several students similar to Zhang Tie after the curfew in these past few days.\u201cLittle bro, it must have been your first time touching a woman today. You should watch out for your health!\u201d Joy suggested him kindly, \u201cSince we\u2019re on the way, let us send you home just in case. Otherwise, you might be caught by the other patrol guards!\u201dUnexpectedly, Joy was so kind-hearted. Hence, Zhang Tie kept walking along with them until they reached an intersection that was less than 200m away from his home.Seeing the lamplights at home, Zhang Tie became somewhat upset, as his dad and mom would have always fallen asleep by this time. Needless to say, they were waiting for him. Entering his house, Zhang Tie saw his dad and mom were just sitting there, waiting for his return. His mom looked furious, while his dad looked dejected, seemingly as if he had been cursed at by his mom. Hearing the door open, his dad and mom saw him coming back and immediately let out a sigh of relief.His mom instantly rushed forward and looked all over Zhang Tie carefully. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s pale face, his mom poked his forehead with force. Without saying a word, she only stared at Zhang Tie and his dad, humphed, and went upstairs.Followed by mom, his dad also walked up to Zhang Tie. Staring at Zhang Tie\u2019s face, he flicked at Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead several times ferociously. \u201cSon, why are you so late? I have already poured out everything to your mom. Because of you, my private money was completely confiscated by your mom!\u201d After saying that, his dad also turned around and went upstairs. However, several steps later, he turned back and asked obscenely, \u201cHow many times?\u201dHearing his dad\u2019s words, Zhang Tie was puzzled and almost shouted out\u2014your son has not circumcised!Receiving no response, Zhang Tie\u2019s dad felt like that question made him lose face as a dad. Hence, he pretended to be serious, coughed twice, and followed Zhang Tie\u2019s mom upstairs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSeeing his dad\u2019s shadow disappearing at the corner of the stairs, Zhang Tie suddenly felt moved and shouted out, \u201cDad!\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d His dad turned around and became curious about what Zhang Tie was going to say.\u201cI love you!\u201d\u201cBoy, I swear you will get no more money from me! I was almost cursed to death by your mom\u2026\u201d Being scared by Zhang Tie\u2019s words, his dad intended to leave but soon turned around again. \u201cYour mom has already prepared dinner for you. It\u2019s in the pot!\u201dStanding in the simple yet warm guest room, Zhang Tie looked around. Thinking back to what had happened to him just one hour ago, Zhang Tie felt a sense of rebirth. Especially when he heard the last words from dad, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t stop his tears anymore\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

On Friday, his biological clock, which would usually wake him at 6:00 am, was late, thus on that day, he did not wake up until it was almost 8:00 am.Whatever, it felt much better than yesterday. At the very least, Zhang Tie\u2019s face was not as pale as yesterday. Although he was still weak, he could stand it. It felt like he had made several wet dreams overnight.What the f*ck! Who said bleeding was beneficial to health? Thinking back to those liars on the streets of Blackhot City who encouraged passersby to donate blood for the sake of health, Zhang Tie became really furious. Blood was the energy essence of the human body. How could people become healthier without blood? If anyone else delivered such a leaflet to Zhang Tie, he would definitely spit on his face. Those liars sold your blood for money while telling you that bleeding was beneficial for your metabolism and the recovery of your stem cells. Motherf*ckers!Since he had gotten up so late this morning, Zhang Tie was almost late for the last day of school. In addition, the way his mom gave him a strange look simply made him feel embarrassed. He remembered that Miss Daina had once said that when one lost too much blood due to some incident, they should eat sugar and protein to recovery quicker. Hence, Zhang Tie, who was always frugal in the past few years, bought himself the most \u201cluxurious\u201d breakfast that he has ever eaten, costing him more than 50 copper coins\u2014a carton of milk and two eggs!. Thus, Zhang Tie felt really depressed about the money he had spent. However, by the time he arrived at school, he felt like he had recovered quicker both physically and mentally.\u2026\u2026Barley must have already shared what he had experienced last night with the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. As Zhang Tie expected, the instant he entered the classroom, the other horny members of the Hit-Plane Brother burst out into laughter.\u201cBro, just tell us what\u2019s making you so unhappy. We\u2019ll make you happy!\u201d Just as Zhang Tie expected, Hista was the first to ask.If it was the day before yesterday, Zhang Tie definitely would have felt frustrated and irritated; however, after surviving last night\u2019s ordeal and taking two lives, Zhang Tie\u2019s way of thinking became completely different. Facing Hista\u2019s ridicule, Zhang Tie simply smiled. \u201cAs you know, I\u2019m still a virgin. Are you satisfied now?\u201dZhang Tie\u2019s response surprised everybody. Everyone thought that Zhang Tie must have suffered a serious blow and was somewhat depressed. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s look, Hista comforted him, \u201cNever mind, I know a good clinic. It\u2019s just a small operation. It will take you just one or two weeks to recover after the operation. If it wasn\u2019t for the upcoming survival training, I would personally take you there. The operation only costs a bit more than 60 silver coins, and we currently don\u2019t have enough money, so Barley already had a talk with us. We have all decided to save some money for you. We will take this survival training as an opportunity, and perhaps we can get something valuable!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, we will never let you drag us down!\u201d\u201cIf there is a virgin in our brotherhood, it would really make us lose face!\u201dHearing their words, Zhang Tie felt warm inside. \u201cThese cute bastards!\u201dSpeaking of money, Zhang Tie suddenly thought of the two dead bodies in the Castle of Black Iron. The two of them seemed to have a lot of money. He was trying his best to survive last night and was extremely spent both physically and mentally; hence, after returning home, he simply ate something and went to bed. He had almost forgotten about their money.Thinking of the pile of gold in Snade\u2019s purse, Zhang Tie immediately became spirited. He could not wait to go back home and searched through the two dead bodies. They might even have something more valuable.\u201cI\u2019m rich! I\u2019m really rich this time!\u201dOn their last day of school, they only had morning classes. After gathering all the undergraduates, the school staff reiterated the dangers and the solemnity of this survival training and delicately repeated the basic necessities that needed to be brought with them. Afterwards, all the undergraduates left school. All of them had two and a half days to prepare for the things requested.According to the school, every undergraduate should at the very least prepare the following things: a weapon, a sleeping bag, and 5 days worth of food. They could bring along a raincoat if their family could afford it. With the exception of extra food, they could pretty much bring whatever they wanted, assuming they were able to bring it along. Additionally, this year, undergraduates from four middle schools will be taking part in the survival training in the Wild Wolf Valley, which was 70 km west of Blackhot City. This was their final chance to show off their abilities. Those who performed the best during the survival training might even receive a recommendation from their school, giving them a chance to change their fates.As it would be their last lunch at the school, the school prepared two spoons of meat for each undergraduate, which they had really enjoyed. After finishing lunch, Zhang Tie felt that he had recovered about 70% of his physical and mental strength.After lunch, everybody was busy seizing the last chance to take photos. Although it was expensive to take a photo, a great amount of people still chose to take photos on this very day. Hence, the photo studios outside the school gate made a lot of money today. The photographers were extremely busy, and the powdered magnesium flashed and puffed here and there on the school campus\u2026Standing to the side, the lower grade students were admiring them. They didn\u2019t understand that that photo might be the last trace of those horny undergraduates in the world.Besides making love, one should leave something behind to show others that they had existed in this secular world!For many of the horny students, ending one\u2019s virgin status and taking a photo before the beginning of their survival training had almost become a ceremony.The seven members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood also took a photo together. In front of the school gate, they stood in a line against the wall that said \u201cWelcome to the Age of Black Iron\u201d. On the farthest left was Bagdad, who was crossing his arms cooly, showing his developed muscles. Next to him was Leit, whose hair was shining, giving him a look of a mature man. Then there was Sharwin, who gave a bashful smile, and Doug, who had one of his arms wrapping around Fatty Barley\u2019s neck. As for Barley, the one who was asked to pay for the photo, he forced a smile although he was miserable inside. Like an idiot, Hista made a hand posture in the form of \u201cV\u201d. Standing on the rightmost position was Zhang Tie, who was somewhat sad and frustrated as he gave off a stiff appearance. The only thing in his mind at the moment was that he would rarely have the opportunity to see Miss Daina from this point on!With a dazzling flash and a sound of \u201cBang!\u201d, a puff of magnesium powder started to rise up. Everybody\u2019s youth and shadow were set fixed!\u2026\u2026\u201cIn the next two days, we should prepare well. Bring as many useful things as you can. In addition, we should stay together during the survival training. That way, we could look after each other during critical situations. The moment to test the unity of our brotherhood is coming!\u201d Barley suggested to the other members of the Brotherhood before they left school. \u201cI will bring a first-aid kit, a bow, and some medicine for curing wounds. As for the others, each of us should bring as much as possible!\u201d\u201cA bow? You really have a rich dad!\u201d Sharwin was surprised while everybody else, including Zhang Tie, was staring at Barley in admiration.\u201cNo way. If I kick the bucket this time, there will be nobody to help him through his old age. He prepared the bow for me since he was even more nervous than me\u2026\u201d Barley shrugged.\u201cAlright, bros, it\u2019s time to fight! See you next Monday!\u201d\u201cOkay, see you next Monday!\u201d\u201cSee you next Monday!\u201dA group of horny students departed outside the school gate and walked in all directions.\u201cBighead, take care. I found that Glaze\u2019s group has been too low-key recently. I feel that there\u2019s something wrong and am somewhat curious about what they\u2019re doing!\u201d Barley warned Zhang Tie in a low voice before leaving.\u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d Zhang Tie patted Barley\u2019s shoulder and gave him a sincere smile. He was probably worried that Glaze\u2019s group would take revenge for what had happened two days ago. However, after what had happened last night, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t take Glaze\u2019s affair seriously in the least.Barley scratched his head as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel like you are completely different than yesterday!\u201d\u201cHaha, I have really suffered a blow from yesterday\u2019s incident. It seems that I have to think things through!\u201d Zhang Tie prattled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs that true?\u201d Barley glanced at Zhang Tie dubiously.\u201cWhatever, take care of yourself!\u201d\u201cAlright, I will!\u201d\u2026\u2026Separating from Barley, Zhang Tie arrived at the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. Today, he would be a flesh bag here again and would also receive his salary. Starting from next week, he would have to attend the survival training, and thus he would not be able to come here. Therefore, he had to ask for a leave from Director Huck.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

When he arrived at the fighting club in the afternoon, there were no guests in the LV1 service area; hence, Zhang Tie decided to use the special training instruments in the training area, which could not be seen at his school at all, as his body slowly recovered. Zhang Tie had intended to test his physical condition using fthe special instruments many times to discern the gap between him and Glaze; however, he abstained from doing so in the end. He was worried that it would bring him troubles once the fact that he was a LV 1 fighter was disclosed to the public. Additionally, he had killed two people last night and was also involved in an extremely large incident. At this important juncture, he should remain low-key, reminding him of an Eastern proverb that his dad had once told him\u2014\u201dExposed rafters will rot first\u201d. Glaze was a prime example of the negative consequences mentioned in the proverb. Having realized that there were many secrets hidden within himself, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t want to repeat the same mistake that Glaze had; therefore, he was determined to hide his real identity as much as he could.It took God 10,000 years to create an olive tree, but the life of a soybean sprout would end in a week.\u201cI want to be an olive tree,\u201d Zhang Tie mumbled to himself.As he had been in the fighting club for the entire afternoon, they had even provided him a meal at work in the evening. The meal at work provided for the ordinary staff was really substantial; it was even better than what he had enjoyed today at school for lunch.Suddenly, Zhang Tie realized that he had eaten meat for three consecutive meals, which had been a humble dream that he has had ever since he was a child. Without knowing it, his dream was simply realized in one day.Was this the legendary proverb \u201cIf one can avoid disaster, one will experience a wonderful blessing after\u201d?After finishing the meal provided at work, Zhang Tie felt that he had recovered a bit more. After resting for another hour, Benet finally arrived\u2026As usual, Zhang Tie was being fiercely beaten; however, this time, after having survived the terrifying life and death situation last night, Zhang Tie looked much calmer when facing Benet\u2019s attacks. He didn\u2019t even feel the slightest bit of nervousness this time and responded much quicker both physically and mentally. Zhang Tie could freely transition between movement and stillness. Having the mental advantage, Zhang Tie hid his physical disadvantage today and stuck it through to the very end. This time, he was neither knocked over nor did he pass out.After another exhausting fight, Zhang Tie and Benet both threw themselves onto the ground as they panted. Seeing Benet\u2019s arrogant air, Zhang Tie started to really admire him. Regardless of the kid\u2019s family background and his character, Zhang Tie started to like this 12-year old boy simply because of his unyielding perseverance. Zhang Tie realized that those rich families might not be as extravagant, as arrogant, and as silly as commoners had thought; they must have some extraordinary traits to become wealthy.\u201cYou are not bad\u201d sitting on the ground as he drank from the water bottle passed by the kid, the sweat covered Zhang Tie praised. After a few times, Zhang Tie had learnt how to undo the damned head protector. Between him and the kid, there was also a slight understanding.\u201cDon\u2019t expect me to go easy on you simply because you praised me!\u201d The sweat covered Benefit smirked as he gazed at Zhang Tie. \u201cI have been immune to this na\u00efve trick a long time ago. In order to marry Mary one day, I will definitely defeat you. To me, you are just a stepping stone. Your miserable destiny was predestined!\u201dMotherf*cker! Hearing his words, Zhang Tie wanted to immediately beat him up ruthlessly. After a while, Zhang Tie stood up and glanced at him. \u201cI will be attending the survival training next Monday, so you will not see me in the next two months. I hope your fighting strength can be as sharp as your mouth when I come back!\u201cDon\u2019t kick the bucket; otherwise, I would not be able to realize the promise I made with Mary!\u201d the kid retorted.The two stared at each other fiercely before Zhang Tie had left. It was not until Zhang Tie had left the training room did Benet start to realize that Zhang Tie had recovered faster than him!\u2026\u2026Leaving the fighting club, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t immediately return home; instead, he had arrived at Donder\u2019s grocery store that was near the railway station. The moment Zhang Tie arrived, Donder, who had been preparing to close the store, caught sight of Zhang Tie and harrumphed, seemingly as if he was still complaining about Zhang Tie\u2019s verbal assault yesterday.\u201cDo old men really care about having their d*ck laughed at?\u201d Zhang Tie laughed at Donder\u2019s response.Zhang Tie also didn\u2019t say a word. He simply helped Donder close the windows and the door and cleaned the store. Afterwards, before Donder had been able to speak, Zhang Tie abruptly hugged him tightly, greatly frightening Donder.\u201cBad boy, what are you doing!? Quickly let go. I am not interested in men!\u201d Donder shouted loudly.Letting go, Zhang Tie stared at Donder with a careful and sincere look. \u201cThank you\u2026\u201dWithout Donder\u2019s two gifts, he might really have died last night, thus he was really grateful to Donder.\u201cThanks for what? Didn\u2019t you have a lot of fun the other night? How did the woman feel?\u201d Donder pretended to be calm.Feeling embarrassed, Zhang Tie scratched his head. \u201cI\u2019m still a virgin!\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t look for a woman last night?\u201d Donder became curious and immediately looked gossipy.\u201cI did!\u201d Zhang Tie answered honestly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t do it?\u201d\u201cHalf way!\u201d\u201cSoft?\u201d\u201cHard, very hard!\u201d\u201cWhat happened\u2026\u201dZhang Tie was embarrassed and whispered to Donder about what had happened.\u201cHahahaha\u2026\u201d The obscene fatty laughed out loudly, almost rolling on the ground. He felt so happy. After laughing for quite a while, Donder wiped the tears at the corners of his eyes and patted Zhang Tie on the shoulder. \u201cBoy, what did I teach you before? Don\u2019t be too arrogant! Otherwise, you will suffer from revenge! If you had asked me about that earlier, you could have discovered this problem in advance. It would be a shame if you died in the survival training as a virgin!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t die that easily!\u201d Zhang Tie confidently said. Feeling the confidence from his words, Donder could not help but stare at Donder for quite a while. \u201cI came to tell you that I won\u2019t be coming for the next two months!\u201d.Smiling, Donder waved his hand. \u201cActually, even after the survival training, you don\u2019t need to come here. It will almost be time for you to start your new life afterwards, so there will be many things you will have to deal with. Not to mention that I\u2019ve already taught you everything I can here. If you come here, you won\u2019t be able to gain any more benefits. But! If you have time, you are free to come and chat with me!\u201d\u2026\u2026On his way home after leaving Donder\u2019s grocery store, Zhang Tie suddenly felt that he had grown up a lot. That small grocery store and the Seven National Male Middle School seemed to have disappeared from his life all in a sudden. What was waiting for him was the mysterious, unknown world outside the lofty city walls\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s see what Huck and Snade have left for me!\u201dThinking of this, Zhang Tie sped up and ran home\u2026As usual, it was late when he returned home, Zhang Tie pushed open the door and smelt an aroma of chicken soup.Unknown whether his mom was still angry about what had happened last night or because she didn\u2019t know what to say to Zhang Tie, when Zhang Tie returned home, his mom was in her bedroom. His father alone waited for him with a bitter look on his face.\u201cChicken soup is in the pot. After you finish, quickly go to bed!\u201d dad said coldly and left.All the food was in the pot. After drinking a small bowl of chicken soup and finishing washing the bowls, Zhang Tie went back to his room.The instant he returned to his room, Zhang Tie entered the Castle of Black Iron.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe familiar words gradually disappeared. Zhang Tie took in a deep breath and walked towards the two dead bodies. Ever since he had carried them in, he hadn\u2019t carefully checked them. Since only a single day has passed, their bodies hadn\u2019t begun to rot, which made Zhang Tie feel reassured.Walking over to Snade\u2019s dead body, Zhang Tie pulled the dagger out of Snade\u2019s body. Yesterday, he was worried that blood would spurt everywhere if he were to pull out the dagger from Snade\u2019s body, which would make it difficult to deal with. Since a day has gone by, blood would naturally no longer spray from the corpse.Although both Snade and Huck were jet black, they did not look frightening. The powerful rat poison really took effect too fast. Before it was even noticed, the violent toxicity had already killed them; it was so fast that not even a frightened expression was left on their faces.Huck had already closed his eyes. In contrast, Snade\u2019s eyes were still widely open, seemingly as if he still had many questions.\u201cIt was you guys who wanted to kill me first, so you can\u2019t blame me for this. I just wanted to survive\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie prayed silently while feeling terrified. After praying, he started to search through Snade\u2019s corpse first. He remembered that Snade seemed to have a purse filled with gold coins. After having seen it last night, Zhang Tie was no longer able to remove it from his mind.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Pulling it out of Snade\u2019s coat, he shook the purse twice. Hearing the sharp sound of the clashing of the coins, the pores all over Zhang Tie\u2019s body seemed to have expanded.The sound was so beautiful that Zhang Tie felt it was the most pleasant sound that he has ever heard. Compared to the sound of the clashes between the gold coins, even the elegant songs of the church choirs became as boring as the quacking of ducks.\u201cHuala! Huala!\u201d [1] Zhang Tie moved the purse close to his ear and shook it. Hearing the clashes of the gold coins, Zhang Tie became excited all over, both physically and mentally.\u201cHuala! Huala!\u201d With two more shakes, Zhang Tie realized that what had happened yesterday was worth it.\u201cHuala! Huala!\u201d With another two shakes, Zhang Tie seemed to see Miss Daina\u2019s smile\u2026\u201cHuala! Huala!\u201d With two more shakes, the whole world became alive\u2026With the purse in hand, Zhang Tie looked like a slow-witted guy. As he shook the purse closely by his ear, a foolish grin crept onto his face. With two more shakes, he made another foolish smile. He kept repeating that boring game for 5 or 6 minutes before he finally burst out into laughter.Let me see the surprise inside the purse!Opening the purse, Zhang Tie squatted on the ground and poured out all the coins from the purse. \u201cHuala!\u201d With one sound of clashing coins, all the coins were poured onto the ground. Seeing those silver and golden rays reflected on the coins, Zhang Tie was so excited that he almost passed out. With a quivering hand, Zhang Tie picked up a gold coin and carefully took a look at it. On the front of the gold coin was a huge locomotive releasing smoke, while the back of the coin showed the symbol of the Andaman Alliance, the 17 Star Rings. This coin was issued by the Andaman Alliance and was called the \u201cLocomotive\u201d Gold Coin by the commoners. Ever since Zhang Tie was born, he had never touched a single gold coin, let alone owning one. Weighing the gold coin by hand, Zhang Tie was brimming with happiness.Zhang Tie became more energetic as he continued to search through Snade\u2019s body. This time, he found a leather bag that was secured close to Snade\u2019s waist. Removing its cover, Zhang Tie moved closer and took a whiff, only to smell a strange, medicinal scent. Inside the bag were various colorful vials. Unfortunately, the vials were not labeled, thus based on his current capabilities, Zhang Tie naturally didn\u2019t know what was inside. Thinking for a while, Zhang Tie put them back inside the leather bag and placed the bag back into Snade\u2019s coat. He was not interested in what was inside the vials, as those things had to be destroyed.Besides the gold coins and the leather bag, Zhang Tie found nothing else on Snade\u2019s body; however, he was already very pleased with what he had found.After searching over Snade, Zhang Tie went for Huck. There was also a purse inside Huck\u2019s coat. Seeing the purse that was as heavy as Snade\u2019s, Zhang Tie soon felt blood rushing to his head. After pouring out all the money from Huck and Snade\u2019s purses, Zhang Tie took in two deep breaths. He then continued to search Huck\u2019s body. This time, he found another leather bag with four vials of medicine used to heal wounds inside. Those medicines were produced by the Continental Pharmacists Union and were packed with their packaging and symbol. These medicines were also sold in Donder\u2019s grocery store. Opening one vial, Zhang Tie smelt it and tasted it a bit. It was of high quality. Zhang Tie found no fake substances inside. It was really difficult to buy a vial of this kind of medicine in the market, especially in the shops neighboring the railway station. As taro powder was neither harmful to humans nor easily noticed by commoners, vendors usually mixed taro powder into real medicine along with additional fake substances that would compose 5 to 20 percent of the medicine. Zhang Tie learned the means that were always adopted by cunning businessmen from Donder\u2019s grocery store.Besides the purses, the medicine bags, and the portable equipment, nothing else was found on the two dead bodies.After searching their dead bodies, Zhang Tie started to search through their luggage. When he was looking for clothes inside Snade\u2019s luggage last night, he had already roughly searched through it and had found nothing that stood out, thus Zhang Tie mainly searched through Huck\u2019s luggage. Opening it, he surprisingly saw a palm-sized box. The instant he saw the box, Zhang Tie became excited because that box was specifically used to store crystals that were of Level 3 or higher. Opening the box, he found two white and translucent double-headed pyramid-based crystals that were almost Level 4 lying inside the box. Feeling his spirit rising, Zhang Tie picked up the two pyramid-based crystals and looked at the two pyramids inside. He then burst out into laughter as each of the crystals was much better than the Level 3 pyramid-based crystals being treasured as top quality pyramids in Donder\u2019s grocery store. These two crystals were worth at least 10 gold coins.Zhang Tie was highly spirited and felt like exclaiming towards the sky.Trembling, Zhang Tie counted the coins. In total, Huck and Snade had contributed 48 gold coins, 79 silver coins, and 34 copper coins to him, which, although was nothing to some people, was a large amount of money for Zhang Tie. This money was almost equivalent to 4 or 5 years worth of his dad\u2019s salary.In addition to the money, he had also received four vials of high-quality medicines that were great for healing wounds, with only half of a vial among the four having been used. Moreover, Zhang Tie also got two top-quality Level 3 pyramid-based crystals. In total, the vials of medicine and the pyramid-based crystals were worth about 18 gold coins.\u201cI\u2019m rich! I\u2019m really rich this time!\u201d Zhang Tie was so high spirited that his face almost cramped.Although the two leather bags that contained the medicine were valuable, they had obvious signs of having been used, as there were scratches on them. If the wear and tear on the leather bags were noticed by people who were familiar with Huck and Snade, then they would inevitably realize that it belonged to them, thus Zhang Tie intended to throw the two leather bags away.After pouring out the items in the sundry box, Zhang Tie carefully stored the gold coins, the medicine, and the pyramid-based crystals in the sundry box. He then returned and began to drag Huck\u2019s body towards the Pool of Chaos, which was the best place to eliminate the evidence.The Pool of Chaos was about 200m away from Zhang Tie. Considering Huck weighed over 150 kg, Zhang Tie gave up dragging his feet after 50 steps. Seeing that line on the soil plowed by Huck\u2019s dead body, Zhang Tie wiped the sweat from his forehead and changed his posture. He held up Huck\u2019s body and let it sit straight up on the ground before squatting against Huck\u2019s back and placing his two arms under the body\u2019s armpits. He then half lifted him and dragged him away. This was much easier than his previous attempt.When faced with danger, people could actually burst out with great potential. Zhang Tie found it really difficult to drag away this body that weighed over 150 kg. In particular, how was he able to carry this body into the Castle of Black Iron last night when he was so weak? Zhang Tie himself had started to be proud of what he had done.Hugging and dragging the body in such a way, Zhang Tie would inevitably cause friction between his arm and Huck\u2019s armpits. As a result, 50m away, Zhang Tie\u2019s felt a completely different feeling from the upper right arm and his upper left arm; his upper right arm that rubbed on the left armpit of Huck\u2019s body was softer. Something seemed to be padding the area under Huck\u2019s left armpit, giving off a smooth feeling when Zhang Tie dragged the body.Could there be something hidden inside? Zhang Tie put down Huck\u2019s body and searched the area around his armpits carefully. Finally, Zhang Tie found something closely hidden by Huck\u2019s left armpit under his inner armor. He found a trivial opening on his clothes that could never be found without a careful inspection. Zhang Tie then undid Huck\u2019s coat and stretched his hand into that opening. Touching a piece of smooth cloth, Zhang Tie then pulled it out directly from that small mysterious bag.\u201cWooh, it\u2019s a red silk cloth! Motherf*cker, it must be very expensive! What\u2019s the purpose of carrying a piece of red cloth? To drive away evil like what Chinese people always did?\u201d Zhang Tie doubted at the first sight of the piece of red cloth.Afterwards, unfolding the piece of red silk cloth, Zhang Tie realized that it was a mask that was similar to those used by the executioners who executed criminals. A man\u2019s head could be properly covered under this mask. In addition, two holes on the cloth were left for eyes and some strange floral grains were embroidered on the forehead of the face mask. There was also a black and terrifying skull between the strange floral grains.Motherf*cker! What the hell! I\u2019ve never seen such an ugly mask. The instant Zhang Tie intended to throw away this red mask, a thought flashed in his mind\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026A terrifying red mask like that of an executioner\u2019s\u2026 Black skull on the mask\u2026 Killing numerous people in bloody ways\u2026Zhang Tie\u2019s face instantly turned pale. Glancing at this mask which symbolized death and blood in his hand, a few words came to Zhang Tie\u2019s mind instantly\u2014Red-scarf Burglar\u2026Sh*t! The 15-year juvenile was frightened. Feeling weak, he sat on the ground helplessly\u2026[1] Apparently, this is the sound that coins make when they clash.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Two weeks ago when his elder brother had talked about the Red-scarf Burglars at the dinner table, Zhang Tie felt as if he was listening to a story. To Zhang Tie, a bandit organization like the Red-scarf Burglars who instilled fear into the entire Andaman Alliance and killed numerous people had nothing to do with common families like the Zhang Family. In Zhang Tie\u2019s mind, although the Red-scarf Burglars were always causing troubles within the territory of the Andaman Alliance, they lived in a completely different world.When the curfew was imposed in Blackhot City, Zhang Tie felt that his life was influenced a bit; however, he was more worried about his elder brother. He hoped that his elder brother would not encounter those butchers with bloodstained hands.The Red-scarf Burglars were infamous across the entire Andaman Alliance because of the numerous casualties caused by them. 12 years ago, the Red-scarf Burglars broke into Baroque, an emerging city, and caused the \u201cBaroque Massacre\u201d, an event feared by everyone. After the massacre, the beautiful city which had more than 100,000 citizens was wiped out. They killed every single living being they met, whether it was man or woman, old or young, and even farm animals like chickens or dogs were not spared, finally resulting in a ghost city.Those vicious Red-scarf Burglars frightened everybody. Although there were less than 1,000 Red-scarf Burglars in total, on average, each of them had killed at least 100 innocent residents in the Baroque Massacre\u2026Every member of the Red-scarf Burglars would wear a red headcover when they took action. Besides a few members who were known by their infamous crimes, the identities of the other members were not known to the public, thus the government had not been able to arrest them. In addition, they acted in secrecy, as they would disappear soon after they finished their missions. Sometimes, they would reappear abruptly, causing people to become muddle-headed.Zhang Tie had never thought that he would be related to such a terrifying organization, let alone killing two of their members.Zhang Tie sat on the ground muddle-headedly for quite a while before he was able to recover his composure. Afterwards, he ran towards Snade\u2019s body and undid his coat. He found the same opening on his clothes near the region of his left armpit under the inner armor and pulled out a terrifying red headcover that was the same as the one from Huck\u2019s armpit.\u201cMotherf*cker, this kick is for your blindness and this kick is for my blood. You bastard, is it that cool to kill people?\u201d Thinking of how he was almost killed by the Red-scarf Burglars, his fear of the two bodies turned into fury and disgust as he ferociously kicked Snade\u2019s body more than 10 times.After venting, Zhang Tie felt much more relaxed. Red-scarf Burglars? So what! Let\u2019s see whether or not you can bite me!\u201cBah\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie spat onto Snade\u2019s body. Then, he dragged Snade\u2019s body by the foot towards the Pool of Chaos, much like dragging a dead dog. He found it much easier to deal with this body, as Snade was much lighter than Huck.After taking two short rests on the way there, Zhang Tie took 5 minutes to drag Snade\u2019s body to a place near the Pool of Chaos. Exerting all his strength, he threw the dead body into the Pool of Chaos, which then slowly sunk into it. Zhang Tie then turned back and spent almost 10 minutes dragging Huck\u2019s huge, dead body to a place near the Pool of Chaos too. After a powerful push, another Red-scarf Burglar disappeared forever from this world.Afterwards, Zhang Tie ran back and threw all their belongings into the Pool of Chaos, including the bag that held the medicine, their purses, their clothes, and the box used to contain the crystals. From then on, the two Red-scarf Burglars completely disappeared from this world, leaving no traces behind.Zhang Tie then became thoroughly relaxed. \u201cFrom now on, who would be able to link the disappearance of those two guys to me?\u201dHe then opened the Basic Attributes Panel of the Castle of Black Iron.\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura Value: 328\u2014\u2014Merit Value: 2122\u2014\u2014Basic Energy Storage: 43.7\u2014\u2014Special Output: VoidAs expected, the aura value and the basic energy storage had both increased. These past few days, as more and more seeds sprouted and grew well, the aura value also gradually increased. However, the merit value almost frightened Zhang Tie. How could it increase by more than 2000 points? Zhang Tie instantly opened the log for merit value to check the reason.\u2014\u2014For the Gods, you have carried out righteousness by killing Snade and Huck, who were part of the infamous Red-scarf Burglars. You have punished evil and have spread the mercy of the Gods unto the earthly world. You have found justice for the numerous people who were wronged by them. As a result, merit value has been increased by 2048.Reading this tip, Zhang Tie became moved, feeling that he did the right thing by killing these two b*tches.After closing the Basic Attributes Window of the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie arrived before the small tree again. He was really depressed about the Leakless Fruit that he had been waiting for over a week. He really wanted to see what had happened to it at that time.The Leakless Fruit that should have been ripe was as large as a peanut kernel. Hanging on a twig, it looked really pitiful. Zhang Tie stretched out his hand as another tip appeared.\u2014\u2014The Leakless Fruit has suspended its growth. After the Lord\u2019s Qi and blood recovers, it will continue to grow.Zhang Tie estimated that all of his energy might be currently used to produce more blood. According to his current physical condition, it might take him a couple of days to fully recover. That was to say, the next Leakless Fruit would grow ripe 10 days later.F*ck! Thinking of this, Zhang Tie cursed Huck and Snade fiercely again. If it wasn\u2019t for that incident last night, he would have improved a lot since the effects of the Leakless Fruit were really great.He had no choice but to wait!Afterwards, Zhang Tie checked the Iron Body Fruit. The new one seemed to have just started to grow, as the fruit was just about 1/5 mature. If he wanted to accelerate its growth, he would have to find opportunities to be fiercely beaten.When Zhang Tie turned back and prepared to leave the Castle of Black Iron, he suddenly saw something shining through the corner of his eye on the small tree.\u201cWhat\u2019s that? Zhang Tie moved back towards the other side of the tree. On the side opposite of the Leakless Fruit, he found a golden ray flashing among the leaves.After walking around half the tree, Zhang Tie stretched out his hand to move away a small leaf. Surprisingly, he found a fruit right hanging there, radiating golden rays. It was perfectly round like a ball, and the skin of the fruit looked gold with golden wisps looming within. Although it did not release a smell as fragrant as the Leakless Fruit and the Iron Body Fruit, this fruit looked much more brilliant than the other two.Seeing this fruit, Zhang Tie gaped. He truly didn\u2019t know when such a fruit had grown ripe.Although he couldn\u2019t think it through, he only had to check the tip. The instant Zhang Tie stretched out his hand towards this strange dark yellow fruit, a tip appeared.\u2014\u2014Fruit of Brilliance has become ripe. Usage: Pick and direct eat it. Notice: The fruit cannot be taken out of the Castle of Black Iron. After twelve hours of having been picked off the tree, its energy and vitality will gradually decline.Seemingly as if it had noticed Zhang Tie\u2019s doubts, another tip appeared above the previous one.\u2014\u2014The deteriorating glorious rays will definitely be used after the death of the sinners. The soul of the sinners shall return to the Dark Land, while the glorious rays of the soul shall remain. The glorious rays were a force that was granted to the soul by the Creator and should not be desecrated. The glorious rays belong to the brave men who spread the righteousness of the Gods. As a brave fighter who brandished your blade against evil, you will earn glorious rays as you judge evil. The glorious rays of the soul will coexist within you, making you stronger.Zhang Tie gulped twice. \u201cGlorious rays? Force of the soul? What were those?\u201d Although Zhang Tie was confused, he definitely knew that the Fruit of Brilliance was something great. Additionally, the glorious rays of the soul might be some force that came from Huck and Snade. Although Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know how powerful Huck and Snade were, he could simply feel that the feeling they gave off was no less oppressive than Captain Kerlin. Was some of their force within this Fruit of Brilliance?\u201cI\u2019m rich, I\u2019m really rich now!\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s heart pounded again. Taking in two deep breaths, he rubbed his face with force, realizing that he was not dreaming. He then meticulously picked off this Fruit of Brilliance as if he were picking accessories at a jewelry store. He would definitely eat it before he recovered composure. Based on his experiences with the Leakless Fruit, taking this fruit carefully, Zhang Tie sat under the small tree with legs crossed. He then engulfed this fruit directly, much like how Bajie ate the human-like fruit [1]. Putting the fruit into his mouth, he then bit into it\u2026The instant he bit into the Fruit of Brilliance, Zhang Tie seemed to have heard a huge sound reverberating deep in his mind. Afterwards, he fully lost consciousness.What happened after was like a dream. In the dream, he felt his body becoming translucent and weightless while a dark yellow fog swirled around a mysterious point in his mind. Afterwards, a wisp of dark yellow fog escaped from that jewel-like Fruit of Brilliance in his mouth. The golden fog then combined with the original fog in his mind. At the same time, a pleasure that he had never experienced before rose from the depths of Zhang Tie\u2019s soul. The pleasant feeling rising from his deepest inner heart made Zhang Tie feel unprecedentedly comfortable and peaceful. In this state, the golden fog escaped from the Fruit of Brilliance and constantly combined with the fog that was originally in his mind. As a result, the original fog in his mind became increasingly thicker and wider as it gradually turned brighter, changing from a dark golden color to a pure golden color\u2026After quite a while, the transformation finally stopped. The fog that was originally in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind had already experienced huge changes, both quantitatively and qualitatively. In quantity, that fog expanded by at least seven-fold. If the original golden fog could be described as a pencil, then the current golden fog could be described as golden bamboo. In quality, besides becoming more vibrant, the fog was filled with Qi that was more energetic and lively\u2026Opening his eyes, much to his surprise, he realized the Castle of Black Iron was different than before. The colors were more vibrant in his eyes, and his nose became much sharper. The scent of soil seemed to have become clearer, and the whole world became more splendid.Picking himself up from the ground, Zhang Tie moved his limbs. His body felt completely new, and every cell in his body seemed to be yelling out in happiness. It was truly a marvelous feeling.What happened? What was that golden fog?He then closed his eyes and opened them after a short while with a strand of shock on his face. He finally knew what the Fruit of Brilliance did and what the golden fog was. The golden fog was the spiritual energy in his mind. Previously, as he was too weak, he couldn\u2019t sense his spiritual energy; however, he could now sense it. The glorious rays in the soul represented spiritual energy. The fact was that the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree had exploited the spiritual energy of the two dead bodies and formed the Fruit of Brilliance with them. The Fruit of Brilliance was used to increase spiritual energy. As their spiritual energy was three times of Zhang Tie\u2019s, after consuming the Fruit of Brilliance, he could feel a sharp increase in his spiritual energy by six-fold\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter figuring out what had happened, Zhang Tie stared at that small tree in awe\u2026In the past, he didn\u2019t know what other benefits having spiritual energy brought besides assisting in the ignition of the burning points, as he had rarely learned about it and had close to no opportunities to learn about it; however, after his spiritual energy was increased by six times, he realized he was able to cultivate much more effectively. Using the same amount of time, he could reach a much better result; otherwise, it would take him a much longer time to achieve such a result. This benefit alone had already made Zhang Tie satisfied. Moreover, with the help of the increased spiritual energy, he could sense more sharply and react much quicker. This was the best gift from the Gods before the survival training even began!\u201cHere I come, survival training!\u201dZhang Tie shouted loudly in the Castle of Black Iron\u2026[1] Bajie was a monk who looked like a pig from the story, \u201cA Journey in the West\u201d. The human-like fruit was a wonderful fruit in the story which was said to give immortality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although the wealthy would probably not be affected by the change of several copper or silver coins, for many at the lowest rungs of society, even a trivial increase in the price of grains or other commodities would greatly put pressure on their ability to survive. Naturally, they were more sensitive to the changes in price. Although the Zhang Family had only increased the price of a bowl of rice brew by a single copper coin, to some, it was a 20 percent increase in price and was something that would be difficult for them to accept.Seeing the Chinese woman dragging away her kid, who kept swallowing his saliva, in the rice brew store, Zhang Tie could only force a bitter smile. In the past, this kid used to eat rice brew in their store, but due to the recently increasing price, the kid\u2019s mom had no choice but to drag him away. For commoners like them, the rising price of grains not only affected the price of a bowl of rice brew but also their overall living expenditure. Influenced by rising price of grains, the price of the other daily necessities like cooking oil and salt also increased. In addition, Zhang Tie heard that the price of coal had also started to rise in Blackhot City for the past few couple of days. Obviously, the price of a wagon full of coal balls had also increased by 5 copper coins. As the price of grains and coal increased, the price of steel produced from ironworks would also naturally increase. Although it was only a small fluctuation, it was not a good feeling for many of the commoners.The Zhang Family\u2019s ugly, remodelled three-wheeler had been borrowed by a neighbor to buy grains. These past two days, several people had come to borrow it to transport necessities. As his sister-in-law said she was a bit uncomfortable this morning, his mom became worried and accompanied her to the hospital, leaving Zhang Tie alone at home. In the rice brew store, Zhang Tie boringly drove away the flies with a fan.Absent-minded in the rice brew store, as Zhang Tie concentrated, an interesting thought appear in his mind\u2026With his spiritual energy increasing by seven fold, Zhang Tie realized that the <mental>that he had been painstakingly training for the past two weeks had greatly improved. Before yesterday, it would take him a long time to visualize an abacus with three columns in his mind, the image of the abacus wouldn\u2019t be steady, and he couldn\u2019t calculate quickly using it either\u2014it wasn\u2019t even able to match the speed of just calculating manually. All in all, he could not use it to do daily calculations easily. Surprisingly, this situation has improved sharply this morning.</mental>At this moment, a golden abacus with seven columns was suspended steadily in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind. The beads on the abacus were moving up and down automatically, outputting results.What\u2019s 36 multiplied by 98? 3528!What\u2019s 1269 plus 9621? 10890!What\u2019s 362 times 125? 45250!What\u2019s 639 divided by 12? 53.25!What\u2019s 98564 divided by 125? 788.512!\u2026\u2026In the past, Zhang Tie needed to use the abacus techniques in order to get an answer, but now, he was able to know the answer the instant he saw the question. After practicing for a while, Zhang Tie realized that he didn\u2019t need to use abacus techniques anymore. After using the abacus for two years, Zhang Tie finally realized how powerful and effective the time-honored calculator was. He didn\u2019t know where the book <mental>that was marked as \u201cAfter-class reading for preliminary students\u201d was from; however, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t believe that any preliminary school student could match him from the intensity and effect of spiritual energy. Previously, his spiritual energy might have been similar to that of a preliminary school student, but ever since his spiritual energy had combined with the Fruit of Brilliance, it has already become seven times of that from before; it was much more powerful at this moment. Benefitting from the new spiritual energy, he could fully experience the powerful effects of <mental>, as he could work it out the instant he saw any calculation question within seven digits. Additionally, Zhang Tie realized the abacus was easily stabilized after it was visualized. During this entire experience, Zhang Tie had even sold a few bowls of rice brew\u2026</mental></mental>\u201cI am able to calculate faster than the manual metal calculators used in trading agencies and commercial banks!\u201d Zhang Tie became excited. He never would have imagined that the sharply increased spiritual energy would help improve his <mental>skills so greatly over night. Zhang Tie was sure that Donder would definitely be startled if he saw his improvement.</mental>As Zhang Tie felt great about using <mental>so easily, an extremely absurd thought suddenly came to mind\u2014maybe this was how people used the abacus in the beginning? A long time ago, people had powerful spiritual energy and could easily use this calculating tool in their mind; however, later on, their spiritual energy declined and they could barely finish calculation in their mind. Thus, someone decided to use a real object to replace the imaginary object in their mind and started to operate by hand. After another hundreds or thousands of years, when everybody was accustomed to operating an abacus by hand, a guy suddenly realized this calculator could be visualized in the mind and could replaced by visualized object. As a result, he invented the <mental>, which reflected the original usage of this calculator\u2026</mental></mental>If his assumptions were correct, then he would be the only person who could master the true usage of this calculator. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know whether this marvelous calculator could be improved. He remembered that Donder had once told him about a powerful profession in the East called \u201cfortuneteller\u201d, which would own a calculator known as \u201cYi\u201d. This calculator was not used to calculate numbers but instead the fortunes or disasters that would befall a person and the changes between the heaven and the earth. Was <mental>related to \u201cYi\u201d?</mental>While Zhang Tie was pondering on this thought, his mom and sister-in-law had returned. Instantly breaking the abacus formed in his mind, he ran towards them. \u201cMom, what\u2019s wrong with sister-in-law?\u201dAfter speaking, Zhang Tie realized that he had said a really silly question. In response to his question, the face of his sister-in-law flushed slightly, and his mom glared at him ferociously and flicked his forehead. \u201cWhat matter? Go make lunch\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026In the afternoon, as usual, Zhang Tie helped his mom make rice brew, but this time, it was different; his sister-in-law had joined them. As a result, they finished much faster than before. After lunch, their neighbor brought back the three-wheeler, and thus Zhang Tie rode it to shop for rice and sugar. As expected, the prices had risen a bit again. Considering the poor sales of rice brew last week, he only bought two bags of rice this time. Returning home, Zhang Tie noticed that his mom was teaching his sister-in-law how to make liquid yeast.\u201cThis liquid yeast is the key, as it determines the final taste of the rice brew. Our Zhang Family makes our own liquid yeast, and we store it inside the spare jars boiling water after they have cooled down. We prepare two jars of rice brew; one is to be used, while the other is to be left to ferment. When one jar of rice brew is almost used up, we\u2019ll add some water, cut-up fruits, fruit rinds, and kernels, and we\u2019ll open it every day and give it a shake to give it some fresh air. After a week, a new jar of rice brew would be ready. We usually put two spoons of well-fermented liquid yeast into each jar before covering the lid. Taste some, this liquid yeast is delicious. Zhang Tie used to stealthily eat it before\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie had remembered those steps deeply in his heart. He didn\u2019t pay attention to what mom had told to his sister-in-law at the beginning; however, his mom really made him lose face in front of his sister-in-law. While listening to what his mom had said, Zhang immediately thought about something\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euYeast\u2014Rice brew\u2014Mutated and evolved yeast\u2014Mutated and evolved rice brew\u2014\uff1fZhang Tie remembered that there was an option in the Castle of Black Iron that allowed all living beings to mutate and evolve, and he had even tried it on a sprouted potato the first time he entered the Castle of Black Iron. As he hasn\u2019t seen any improvement lately, he had almost forgotten about it. Watching his mom teach his sister-in-law how to make liquid yeast, Zhang Tie had a sudden realization. If he could help mutate or evolve the yeast used to make brew, would the taste of the rice brew be improved? If so, that would help improve the sales of the Zhang Family\u2019s rice brew.After thinking for a while, Zhang Tie felt this way was feasible. At the very least, he could have a try. \u201cThe Zhang\u2019s family has already used the same method to make rice brew for the past two decades, so why not try something new? Nothing is lost even if it fails!\u201dThinking of this, Zhang Tie became excited. In response, in the evening, he found a clean glass jar in the kitchen and stealthily filled it with half a bottle of liquid yeast. Afterwards, he took it back to his room and quickly entered the Castle of Black Iron. Opening the \u201cLiving Beings and Species Management\u201d option, he chose \u201cCarbon-based Living Beings and Species Management\u201d and then \u201cMicroorganisms\u201d. After selecting that bottle of liquid yeast, he inputted 300 points of aura value, 5 points of merit value, and 0.1 point of basic energy storage and started the first evolution and mutation for the yeast.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, please wait patiently!Reading this message, Zhang Tie estimated that the time consumption for evolution and mutation might be related to the life cycle of the living being. Seeing as how the yeast would become evolved and mutated after two weeks, Zhang tie estimated that it would take about 2 months for the potato to evolve and mutate.Through this attempt, Zhang Tie realized one thing\u2014there is a limit to the number of aura value points, merit value points, and basic energy storage points that a microorganism can receive. For example, with the experiment with the half bottle of liquid yeast, when he slid the three bars to the furthest right positions, the maximum number of aura value was 7600 points, the maximum number of merit value was 860 points, and the maximum number for basic energy storage was 340 points. Seeing those \u201chuge numbers\u201d, Zhang Tie was greatly startled before frugally choosing to make a bearable, small investment.After leaving the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie noticed that his dad had already returned home. It was currently time for supper, and today\u2019s supper was extremely luxurious, consisting of ham and beef. In addition, his mom had made many delicious dishes that would make Zhang Tie drool. On the table, his mom kept putting food from the dishes into Zhang Tie\u2019s bowl while his dad lectured him about topics pertaining to the survival training.\u201cNo matter what, remember not to act alone, especially in the evening! Am I clear?\u201dZhang Tie nodded while chewing.\u201cAdditionally, don\u2019t try to show off,\u201d his mom added aside.\u201cMom, look at your son\u2019s slim limbs. What do I have to show off?\u201d Zhang Tie raised his voice. Hearing his words, his dad flicked his forehead with a chopstick.\u201cYour mom, of course, knows that you have nothing to show off. What she meant was that you should think twice before taking action. Out there is not like here where we\u2019re inside the city walls. There are many things out there that can take the lives of men!\u201d\u201cI know!\u201d Thinking back to how his mom looked when she gazed at the picture of his dead eldest brother, Zhang Tie swore that he would survive and return safely no matter what.At supper, like a nodding chick, Zhang Tie constantly lowered his head to eat rice under the lecturing of his mom and dad\u2026\u2026After supper was finished, Zhang Tie brought out 3 gold coins from his pocket and pulled over his mom\u2019s hand before placing them in her hands. The three heavy and brilliant locomotives on the gold coins almost frightened both his dad and mom. Even his sister-in-law widely opened her eyes.His dad became mouth gaped as he stared at the 3 gold coins before turning over to Zhang Tie. He even held one up and glanced over it carefully. \u201cWhere\u2026 where did you get so much money?\u201dWith a face full of pride, Zhang Tie replied, \u201cYour son, of course, earned it at the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. There are many rich people there, so when I serve them well, those rich boys would reward me with 1 gold coin as a tip!\u201d Zhang Tie was not telling a lie. In reality, just as he said, training partners and the waiters would usually earn tips at the Iron Thorns Fighting Club. The tips would always vary from several silver coins to several gold coins. For example, girls like Mary would earn an amazing amount from tips each month. Although Zhang Tie had never received any tips, this lie of his could never be revealed. Even the fighting club wouldn\u2019t ask the guests on the sixth floor whether they had given Zhang Tie a tip.\u201cThis\u2026 this is really too much!\u201d His mom still couldn\u2019t believe it. 3 gold coins were equivalent to a season\u2019s worth of salary for his dad. To his family, this was still a lot of money.\u201cMom, those rich boys would spend over 10 gold coins just to buy a single pair of leather shoes. You should take a look at the prices on Bright Avenue. What there isn\u2019t astronomically priced? Although the stuff there is expensive for us, but for people like them, it isn\u2019t much. Why else do you think there are so many rich people practicing in the fighting clubs? Your son has grown up. In the future, I\u2019ll earn even more money. For the next few days, I\u2019ll be participating in the survival training. During this time, you shouldn\u2019t worry about money and should buy something good to eat. You should also buy more nutritious food for sister-in-law so that my niece or nephew will grow well in the future. You should also look after yourselves and just enjoy the benefits brought back by your sons.\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, his dad and mom finally believed him. At the very least, they had heard of such things about the fighting clubs. They also knew that there were many rich people who would casually spend money in such a way that commoners like the Zhang Family would definitely never be able to afford.Seeing that his mom had finally received the 3 gold coins, Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh inwardly. From now on, he could always bring back some \u201ctip\u201d and relieve the burden on his dad and mom. Since the sales of rice brew had declined this week, they had less money to spend to improve their quality of life. Because of this, his mom and dad have also been unhappy. When his sister-in-law was going to give birth to a baby, Zhang Tie knew clearly that the increasing expenditures would add more burden to his dad and mom. Seeing his mom receive the money and the smiles on their face as if they had relieved a burden, Zhang Tie was also filled with warmth.The next day, every family member started to become busy to make preparations for Zhang Tie\u2019s survival training. The Zhang Family\u2019s rice brew store was also closed on that day.A sleeping bag, portable protective leather armor, a raincoat, a helmet, an aluminum kettle, a leather belt, a knapsack, and a multi-purpose military shovel. All the things could be found at home, as they were used by Zhang Yang when he participated in the survival training, which had then been put away by his mom. Now that it was Zhang Tie\u2019s turn to participate in the survival training, his mom brought them out of the boxes, giving them to Zhang Tie to use. Many things were shared between the generations. After it was used by the elder brother, the younger brother would use it. After the younger brother, then the son. They would never be abandoned until they couldn\u2019t be used anymore. Although these goods have shown wear and tear over the years, because his mom had stored them well, when she took it out, all of it was still usable. These were also common goods that most families in Blackhot City would prepare for their kids\u2019 participation in the survival training.After drying the sleeping bag under the sun for the entire day, Zhang Tie\u2019s mom silently hid one bag of fried rice into the sleeping bag. Although the amount of food allowed to be brought was supposed to be less than 5 kg, as long as they didn\u2019t hide too much, the teachers would not care\u2026His dad completely polished the leather armor with oil again and sharpened the military shovel. Afterwards, he went out to buy 4 to 5 kgs of compressed biscuits and 1kg of beef jerky for Zhang Tie\u2026His sister-in-law hurriedly adjusted the soft cushion inside the helmet to match the size of Zhang Tie\u2019s head. She then cleaned the kettle and prepared a set of clean clothes and a needlework bag for Zhang Tie\u2026\u2026\u2026After a day of busy work, they had finally well prepared all the necessities for Zhang Tie\u2019s participation in the survival training. The last supper at home before the survival training was also rich. Zhang Tie\u2019s dad and mom became both worried and sad. Excluding his mom, who repeatedly warned him, there were fewer words spoken at the table than before.Zhang Tie was also somewhat sad. Survival training was both a test of the ability of an adult to survive and was also the prelude of what\u2019s to come when he struggles for his survival. At the beginning of supper, everything went smoothly. However, as the dinner went on, his mom\u2019s tears began to drop into her bowl as she spoke to him. Seeing that, Zhang Tie felt too sad to eat as well.\u201cMom, trust me. I\u2019ll be ok!\u201d Zhang Tie had to comfort his mom. Although he didn\u2019t know how his mom felt as she prepared the equipment for her son\u2019s departure, his mom\u2019s tears immediately aroused the sadness of the entire family that had been repressed and hidden during this period of time. As the youngest son, Zhang Tie would soon leave Blackhot City. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s mom weeping, his dad\u2019s eyes also turned red and so did Zhang Tie\u2019s. The last supper ended in this way.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026When dusk fell, Zhang Tie went out. After passing several streets, Zhang Tie finally arrived outside a post office near the most boisterous citizens\u2019 square in the center of Blackhot City. He looked around and made sure nobody had noticed him. He then put an envelope into a mailbox outside the post office before going back home as if nothing had happened.The envelope had been previously brought back by hs elder brother and was one of the living necessities provided to the City Guard Army of Blackhot City. As a soldier, his elder brother would receive two exclusive envelopes per month, which could be sent out without pasting a stamp. In the past, his elder brother had brought back several envelopes, while the extras had been sold to the black market, which was one of the best sellers. The envelope contained the headcover of the Red-scarf Burglars and a letter that Zhang Tie had written in standard printed font. The letter would be directly sent to the headquarter of the CISF of Blackhot City. On the letter was only one line: The Red-scarf Burglars are colluding with the Niumuen Business Group to attack Blackhot City!For Zhang Tie, this was already the most he could do. In this conspiracy, whether it was the Red-scarf Burglars or the Niuemuen Business Group, they were both monsters to Zhang Tie and the Zhang Family. To be involved in such a large-scale war, he would be trampled to death like an ant involved in a battle between a flock of elephants.Not to mention, there was still a more terrifying figure behind the two powers, the one Snade and Huck had referred to as \u201cLord\u201d. The word \u201cLord\u201d that had inadvertently escaped from Snade and Huck\u2019s mouth had caused Zhang Tie to feel a chill in his heart. Zhang Tie had to abandon the lucky idea to use this event to seek for maximum benefits.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the very least, nobody in Blackhot City and even the Andaman Alliance was qualified to enjoy being called as such. Even the president of the Andaman Alliance Parliament\u2014\u2014the owner of Andaman City and the head of the Andaman family, the richest and most privileged person in the Andaman Alliance, the one who had used their family name as the name of the Alliance\u2014could only be called \u201cYour Excellency\u201d and not \u201cLord\u201d.Actually, Zhang Tie dared not to be involved in this event, but due to his disgust towards the Red-scarf Burglars and his commitment to the city after eight years of compulsory education, he finally chose to send a warning to the ruler of this city. That was the best he could do. As for whether the letter would cause an uproar or be thrown into the trash can, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t think it was his concern anymore. In the worst case scenario, the city would change its ruler. The Red-scarf Burglars were only a tool used by a big figure; they would not become the ruler of the city.Small figures were better off minding their own business!For Zhang Tie, he felt that what he should be most concerned about was the survival training that begins tomorrow. The other matters weren\u2019t a big concern.A peaceful night soon passed\u2026When he got up the next morning, he found out that his mom and dad had already gotten up. Mom\u2019s eyes turned slightly red and swollen. She had long prepared a scrumptious breakfast for Zhang Tie while his dad was checking his belongings again and again.\u201cEat more. Only after eating will you have enough strength to finish the long trip!\u201dWith his head lowered the entire time, Zhang Tie washed his face, brushed his teeth, and ate breakfast. Feeling depressed, he wore his protective leather armor, buckled his belt, and carried his luggage that contained the folded military shovel inside with the help of his dad and mom. Putting on a helmet, he hung the sword gifted by his dad on one side of his waist along with a kettle and hung the spearhead of his pike on the other. Additionally, the dagger gifted by his elder brother was also fixed onto the belt.Standing, Zhang Tie shook twice to make sure everything had been prepared well. Although he was carrying more than 20 kg of goods, Zhang Tie could still move freely. Forcing a smile, he said, \u201cDad, mom, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019ll be leaving now. You don\u2019t need to worry about me, I\u2019ll be ok!\u201d\u201cGuoguo, hold on\u2026\u201d Before Zhang Tie left, his mom stopped him. With tears dropping down, his mom helped him arrange his leather belt and luggage once again. Pulling at the corner of Zhang Tie\u2019s clothes, she said in a low voice, \u201cIf you can, remember to come back soon. Don\u2019t try to show off\u2026\u201d\u201cI got it, mom!\u201d Zhang Tie felt like he was about to cry. If he did not leave soon, he would lose face in front of his mom and dad. Taking in a deep breath, Zhang Tie forcefully hugged his mom and dad. He then lowered his head and turned around. Pulling open the door, he strode out the house where he had received warmth for the past 15 years.The moment he closed the door, Zhang Tie heard the sound of his mom weeping\u2026It was still dark outside as several stars hung in the sky. After wiping his tears, Zhang Tie strode towards school. At about 100m away, Zhang Tie suddenly felt something. Turning his head, Zhang Tie saw his mom and dad, hand in hand, watching him under the first rays of the morning sun. Waving his hand at them, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but shed some tears.\u2026\u2026On the dawn of this day, such scenes could be seen throughout Blackhot City\u2014a young boy, who would soon be at the age where they would be adults and have to part from home, leaving home with luggage carried on his back and a weapon in hand, and seeing him off would be his parents as they stood by the doorway, crying. Without the protection of the city walls, they alone would encounter many difficulties and challenges in this age.Every year, in Blackhot City, there were teenagers that would never be able to return home again. For some, this was a departure that meant life and death.On the way, Zhang Tie met many teenagers like him walking towards school as they carried luggage on their backs and weapons in their hands.When Zhang Tie arrived at school, he found more than half of the undergraduates had already arrived and were resting on the training grounds. According to the plan, they were to leave at 7:30 am, thus many of the horny students had already been prepared and had arrived at the training ground before 7:00 am. Besides the uniformed luggage, they were each equipped with various equipment. Noisily, those horny students formed into many small groups according to the usual training regions on the training ground. Hearing the noise, Zhang Tie no longer felt sad.The moment he arrived, Zhang Tie saw Bagdad and Sharwin, who had arrived earlier than him. Looking at the huge axe hanging on Bagdad\u2019s shoulder, Zhang Tie then glanced at his own sword. He was really shocked from the difference, becoming speechless.On the training ground, Bagdad\u2019s style was absolutely masculine and eye-catching. With only a half-body shoulder armor on his naked upper body, the muscles under his dark skin were revealed. The armor was only used to protect his right shoulder and heart, and a shiny axe weighing at least 30 kgs was hung on his shoulder armor, giving off quite a cool appearance. In contrast, like Zhang Tie, Sharwin looked much more average\u2014a luggage, a leather armor, a belt, a kettle, and a sword. Zhang Tie felt something was wrong with Sharwin\u2019s equipment, as they were too old and heavily worn. Take Sharwin\u2019s short sword as an example; the sheath showed signs of cracks and the sword within could even be seen. In addition, that leather armor was obviously smaller than Sharwin\u2019s figure, and as for the aluminum kettle, Zhang Tie swore that he has never seen a padded military kettle like this one before. Although he knew Sharwin\u2019s family was poor, he still could not believe his eyes. That was too excessive! Zhang Tie had already cursed Sharwin\u2019s dad dozens of times inside.Standing beside Bagdad, Sharwin felt embarrassed as he lowered his head and cleaned his fingernails. At the same time, Bagdad cursed resentfully.\u201cYour dad is too much! How could he give you such poor equipment!? Given the money you have made for your family during the past years, you could already get what you need. Take a look at that so-called 'sword\u201d. It\u2019s already heavily rusted. It\u2019s only shiny because it had been polished on the knife grinder at the cost of its thickness and length. It won\u2019t function well since both the blade and the body of the sword had been ground too thin. This is too much! When we return, we must go to your house and teach him a lesson\u2026\u201d\u201cForget it. I still have several younger brothers, so my dad might not have been able to save too much money for me. To already have this, I\u2019m already content\u2026\u201d Sharwin explained weakly, looking dejected and sad.Seeing Sharwin\u2019s sad mood, Zhang Tie gloomily walked towards him. He said nothing as he directly pulled out the sword from Sharwin\u2019s waist. Looking at that sword, Zhang Tie was instantly filled with rage. It really was like what Bagdad had said. Can you really call this a motherf*cking sword? It was simply a thin iron sheet! Holding it, Zhang Tie felt it was very unstable. Pits the size of rice could be seen everywhere on the blade due to it being heavily rusted. After grinding it, although it looked a bit shiny, it became much thinner than before, mostly because it was heavily rusted. It felt extremely light in Zhang Tie\u2019s hand. One would have to slash quickly and fiercely even to kill a chicken, let alone those dangerous living beings outside the city walls.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Tie immediately undid his own sword and gave it to Sharwin. \u201cTake mine!\u201d\u201cNo need, no need. I can use this!\u201d Sharwin hurriedly refused him, intending to retrieve his sword.Saying nothing, Zhang Tie threw Sharwin\u2019s sword onto the ground, directly breaking it into two halves. Seeing the 2 pieces of his broken sword, Sharwin\u2019s face turned pale. Saying nothing else, he bit his own lips tightly and looked even more dejected.Zhang Tie patted Sharwin\u2019s shoulder and the dagger on his waist. \u201cTrust me, just use mine. I still have a dagger. In addition, I also have a spear head. Once I find a wooden stick and attach it, I would have a complete spear. With my spear and dagger, us seven brothers will definitely succeed this survival training!\u201dSharwin finally nodded. Unknown to what he had seen, his eyes were widely looking at something behind Zhang Tie. Hearing the chaos behind him, Zhang Tie turned back and saw Fatty Barley walking towards them with a huge luggage on his back like a tortoise. The huge luggage and his equipment had caused the commotion. Compared to Sharwin\u2019s poor equipment, Fatty Barley\u2019s equipment was the very definition of nouveau riche\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Every undergraduate opened their luggage and placed it before their feet, waiting for the inspection of the coaches and Captain Kerlin. Besides 5kg of food, some undergraduate had also hidden some in their luggage. Using Zhang Tie as an example, his mom had prepared some fried rice for him and had hidden it in the inner layer of his luggage. If wasn\u2019t too excessive, the coaches and teachers would not punish them for it. Of course, if anyone brought too much food, the surplus food had to be handed in, and at the same time, the coach or teacher in front of him would give him a stern look. If such a thing were to occur, it would perhaps not be worth it to bring so much food.Based on the experiences of their predecessors, all the horny students understood the bottom line\u2014they could not secretly bring more than 1kg of food, which was basically one day\u2019s worth of food. If anyone exceeded this amount, then they would be punished.Soon after their luggage were checked, Captain Kerlin sent his order, \u201cSet Off.\u201d Hearing his order, those horny students shouldered their luggage and walked out of the school in lines in their respective class towards the west gate of Blackhot City.It was only when they had walked out the school gates did the students from the lower grades arrive at school. With a complex look in their eyes, they stood on both sides of the school gates as they saw off the undergraduates equipped with weapons!For the kids from commoner families in Blackhot City, none of them would be able to avoid participating in the survival training; it was their destiny, and it was the destiny of everyone in this age. For humans to expand their living domain, they relied on sending out young men from the school gates every year despite the fact that some would lose their lives.\u201cLittle brothers, work hard! Next year, it will be your turn!\u201d Some guy at the front loudly shouted. Unfortunately, only a few people responded, as his words had made them depressed.Remaining silent, Zhang Tie moved on along with the others. Compared to when he had first arrived at school, his luggage had become heavier. The most obvious change was the black pot covering his luggage. All the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood were shouldering more goods than when they had arrived at school. Everything extra they had been carrying was something that Fatty Barley brought. In regards to the huge pot, Fatty Barley only had one reason: if they could drink soup, they would have \u2153 more choices to choose from for food, and they could also reduce their food consumption by \u00bc while being able to recover their physiques a bit faster. The reason Fatty Barley gave was convincing and persuasive, thus Zhang Tie shook his head and carried the ridiculously huge black pot along with his luggage.Ever since the morning, he had been carrying the black pot. For some unknown reason, perhaps due to superstition in the eastern countries[1], Zhang Tie faintly felt that he would encounter troubles during this survival training. Before he had left, he had noticed a vicious glare from Sharon, who was standing beside Glaze. Thinking of how low-key Glaze\u2019s group has been acting these days, Zhang Tie felt as if something bad would happen to him.In fact, they actually didn\u2019t need to bring a pot; if they wanted to drink soup, they could simply use their own helmets or food container, which was what most people did. Zhang Tie had also suggested this; however, Fatty Barley gave him a mysterious smile as he told Zhang Tie that he would know the advantages of the pot when they arrived.Therefore, Zhang Tie set off with that huge black pot on his back. It was such a big pot that even Captain Kerlin gave it a look a few times.However, the black pot paled in comparison to the killing machine known as the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d, a light, complex pulley-based crossbow used by professionals, that hung on Doug\u2019s shoulder. Although it was lighter than other crossbows, it was 1m in length and weighed 30kg before having been loaded with arrows. As all the important parts of the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d were made of a special alloy, it looked like a huge steel kite on Doug\u2019s back, making it really eye-catching.While carrying the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d that was not too heavy around his shoulder, Doug gave off an arrogant air, causing Bagdad\u2019s eyes to turn green with envy.The \u201cIron Gate\u201d was also brought by Fatty. Compared with Sharwin\u2019s miserable treatment, Barley\u2019s dad had really paid an exorbitant amount for the survival training. From what Zhang Tie knew, an \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d was worth at least 15 gold coins since it had to be made from a special, high-performance alloy. It was not possible to produce the crossbow in Blackhot City; only Kalur of the Andaman Alliance, known as the city of machines, was able to produce the series of long-range weapons which the \u201cIron Gate\u201d belonged to.While Doug carried the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d, Sharwin and Leit carried two arrow containers. Each cross-arrow container contained 80 standard, steel armor-piercing arrows and 2 clips[2]. In addition, Bagdad also helped Fatty carry a steel pike that could be assembled, while Hista was carrying a professional outdoor bag for Fatty. Zhang Tie was really speechless about Barley, as there were still a lot of things on him. This time, Zhang Tie knew clearly how afraid of death Fatty Barley was.When they were setting off school, the first morning rays cast down in Blackhot City. Walking on the street, the tidy footsteps arouse the attention of all the passersby. Seeing these young men leaving the city, some kind-hearted, middle-aged women would stop walking and would start to pray with clasped hands. In addition, pastors and priests from the church of the Brilliance God had long prepared to spray holy water over each horny student on the roadside.\u201cChildren, God will bless you. Use your machetes and spears to deal with those beasts outside the city walls. Go and spray the glorious rays of humankind in those remote places. The believers of God will definitely return safely!\u201d shouted the big-bellied nun.Zhang Tie\u2019s clothes and face had also been sprayed with several droplets. The Brilliance God was worshiped by the Sun Dynasty, a country that had unified both state and church. The school of the Brilliance God covered every nook and cranny of that country. It was said that all the government officials in that country were assumed by clergymen. In the Sun Dynasty, government officials owned the sovereign powers; however, they didn\u2019t refer to themselves as government officials and had even forbade others from calling them that. Instead, they preferred to be called the most pious servants. In Barley\u2019s words, they were just a group of bastards that wanted to erect memorial archways[3] for themselves.\u201cThat priest is obviously obsessed with alcohol and women. Those young nuns beside him are not virgins!\u201d Passing by that bastard who was spraying holy water, Hista, the obscene guy, lowered his voice and told Zhang Tie, \u201cSeeing the look in the nuns\u2019 eyes and their eyebrows, I can tell that the two nuns had just made love with someone an hour ago and are still fascinated even now. Motherf*ckers, do they really think we\u2019re still virgins?\u201d\u201cYou could even see this?\u201d Zhang Tie was really startled.\u201cOf course, if you spend as much time as I have on women, you can also easily tell whether they have just made love through looking, tasting, smelling, and touching. Let alone the eyes, I can even tell just by using my tongue\u2026\u201d Hista replied pleasantly.\u201cHow do you identify it by tongue?\u201d Zhang Tie doubted.\u201cIf you have kissed them, you will be able to find that women having made love always have a cold tongue tip\u2026\u201d Hista answered confidently.Hearing Hista\u2019s words, Zhang Tie immediately became self-abased and speechless.\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie and the other horny students walked across half of Blackhot City. On the way, they had encountered several groups from other schools. After some greetings, they would head to their own destinations. There were more than 10,000 undergraduates in Blackhot City. Naturally, not all of them would go to Wild Wolf Valley for their survival training; instead, they would scatter to areas 50-80 km away from Blackhot City. After special inspection, the difficulty in those areas used for survival training did not vary too much, thus every year, representatives of the schools would choose the place for survival training by drawing lots. This year, the Seventh National Male Middle School drew the Wild Wolf Valley, which was neither too bad nor too good. Generally speaking, the closer it was to Blackhot City, the less dangerous it would be. As Wild Wolf Valley was 70 km away from Blackhot City, it was neither too dangerous nor too safe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen Zhang Tie and his team passed by the municipal square, Zhang Tie glanced at that mailbox one last time before forcing himself to forget about it. 20 minutes later at 8:00 am, the team arrived at the west gate of Blackhot City and soon left Blackhot City through the gate.While passing through the dim city gates, Zhang Tie really felt like he was drilling through a mouse den; inside the tunnel of the gate that spanned 50m, it was so dim that lamps had to be lit inside during the day. Leaving Blackhot City, the horny students were really shocked by the magnificent Blackhot Mountain Ranges which were twisting like huge dragons in front of their eyes. The scene made them breathless. On average, the mountains were taller than 10,000m, and at the top of the mountains, were snow white lines. Several huge shadows of eagles hovering in the sky brought them a sense of desolation.[1] Carrying a black pot means shouldering the blame for others.[2] An arrow has to be put inside a clip before being shot out.[3] Memorial Archway is a symbol of humble behaviors and good popularity.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If they brought nothing with them, it would not be difficult for Zhang Tie and the other students of Seventh National Male Middle School to arrive there during the day, although they would have to expend some effort. However, as each of them was carrying tens of kilograms of luggage on their backs, it was undoubtedly a huge struggle for everyone.The scenery outside the city walls was completely different from that within the walls. Within the areas 10km away from the city walls, they were able to see patches of farmlands and the farmers working in the fields. There were watchtowers set at a specific distance between each other. These watchtowers had two functions: the first function was to send warnings, and the second function was to provide refuge for the farmers in the event that they suffer an attack from any dangerous living beings at any point in time.One kilometer away from the city, they passed the first farming town. Compared to the high city walls that were about 30m high in Blackhot City, the walls in that farming town were only about 5m in height. It looked extremely easy to destroy, as a height of 5m was not much of an obstacle for many magical beasts and dangerous living beings. The small town covered less than one square kilometer, as the farmlands were outside the walls. In the daytime, many farmers would work in the field. Seeing those students, many of them stopped their work.\u201cWhich school are you from?\u201d an uncle that was about 30 years of age standing in the wheat field asked.\u201cSeventh National Male Middle School!\u201d someone replied.\u201cHa\u2026Ha\u2026 I graduated from Tenth National Male Middle School. Guys, kill more beasts for us. Lately, there has been more and more demon beasts outside the city walls\u2026\u201d\u201cWe will\u2026\u201d\u201cCome back alive! Remember not to excrete your bowel in the woods\u2026\u201d the farmer shouted.\u201cWhat\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t expose your bare butts in the air\u2026\u201d\u201cF*cking lunatic!\u201d hearing the farmer\u2019s words, that students cursed as he caught up to the team. Seeing that farmer, whose skin had turned black under the sun, Zhang Tie was moved and then kept his words in mind.The farther the towns and villages were from Blackhot City, the smaller they would be and the lower the walls would be. Finally, when they were 10 km away from Blackhot City, they saw the last town, which was only surrounded by a wooden fence that was about 3m in height. As they passed this town, they suddenly heard the continuous urgent ringing of bells drifting from a wooden watch tower in the field outside the town. Hearing the ringing of the bells, the farmers hurriedly dropped their tools and ran inside the town. At the same time, a team of fully-armored people mounted on horses rushed out.\u201cDefend your positions!\u201d Captain Kerlin shouted as he instantly rushed out with a spear in hand like a galloping war horse. It was only at that moment that the students from the Seventh Male Middle School realized how powerful Captain Kerlin was.\u201cOh my god, Captain Kerlin\u2019s speed is at least 20m/s\u2026\u201d all the horny students shouted as they kept their eyes on Captain Kerlin.Only a few breaths had passed, yet Captain Kerlin was already 100m away from the group. Soon, they saw a huge totem of a Bloody Scorpion rising up from behind Captain Kerlin.\u201cBattle Qi! That is Captain Kerlin\u2019s Battle Qi! Captain Kerlin is a Bloody-Scorpion Fighter\u2026\u201d more horny students shouted. At the same time, Captain Kerlin jumped directly from the ground like a hawk as he threw his spear like a bolt of lightning. The heroic gesture of Captain Kerlin made everybody fascinated. Even many years later, Zhang Tie would still be able to remember that man who was flying like an eagle in the air as he threw his spear.The moment the spear was thrown, the shrilling sound of breaking wind drifted from far away along with the miserable shriek from a beast. Afterwards, everything returned back to normal\u2026The group then marched on again.After walking 200m, all the horny students were able to see the results of Captain Kerlin\u2019s spear\u2014a Lv 5 mutated magical beast, a colorful leopard, that was almost 2m in length without including its tail was nailed onto one side of the road by the spear when it had drilled out from the woods. About 3 feet of the spear had entered the ground, meaning half of it was buried.Captain Kerlin said a few words to the soldiers rushing out from the town, then he turned around and pulled the spear out from the magical beast. Afterwards, he led those horny students back on the way again.When Captain Kerlin returned to the group after killing that magical beast, he had already become the hero in the heart of every one of the horny students. No matter how terrible that one-eyed man was at school, he really made people reassured outside the city walls. With its body and its blood, the colorful leopard reminded the passersby that this was just the beginning.\u201cDid you guys hear the screeching sound drifting from the air when Captain Kerlin threw his spear?\u201d Bagdad asked the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood.Zhang Tie and the others nodded.\u201cNo crap, anyone could hear that!\u201d Fatty Barley answered weakly. \u201cI have never expected that one-eyed guy to be that powerful!\u201d\u201cYou guys didn\u2019t understand what I meant!\u201d Bagdad scratched his face, as he didn\u2019t know how to express his thoughts. \u201cI meant what\u2019s the reason of that shrieking sound?\u201d\u201cVery good, very powerful!\u201d Doug replied foolishly which directly won him a contemptuous glare from Bagdad.\u201cDo you mean that attack was special?\u201d Leit rolled his eyes as he asked.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m guessing that attack was a sonic boom!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by sonic boom?\u201d Sharwin asked curiously.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about sonic boom at the fighting club. It means when the attacks of those great fighters can reach a speed faster than 340m/s, which is the speed of sound transmission. Once they reach that speed, they would break an invisible barrier called the sound barrier. Afterwards, a huge shrieking sound of breaking air could be heard. This is called sonic boom, a symbol of great fighters!\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026\u201d Barley stared at Bagdad in a look of amazement.\u201cRight! I felt like the moment it left Captain Kerlin\u2019s hand, the spear was already faster than 340m/s. We heard the shrieking sound of air breaking when it moved faster than the sound transmission speed!\u201d While explaining, Bagdad, with an admiring look, looked at the huge shadow of the one-eyed man who stood at the forefront of the team. \u201cCaptain Kerlin is truly a very powerful man!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs it that difficult to reach the speed of sound?\u201d Zhang Tie asked curiously.\u201cYes, very difficult!\u201d Bagdad nodded his head. \u201cI have heard that there are powerful bowmen who are able to make use of super heavy war bows that could shoot arrows out at a speed that\u2019s faster than the speed of sound. But! There are less than 50 such people in the entire Blackhot City. Anyone who could reach the speed of sound using a super heavy fighting bow would immediately be awarded the rank of a second lieutenant and would be able to enjoy its respective treatment. The military of Blackhot City had long had a dream to build a \u201cSonic Boom Matrix\u201d that utilized super heavy fighting bows to launch long distance attacks alongside the three top pikemen matrices, but unfortunately, they have failed even after so many years. From this, you should be able to tell how valuable this skill is. Earlier, Captain Kerlin was able to achieve this by throwing his spear, which is even more difficult than using a fighting bow!\u201dHearing Bagdad\u2019s explanation, everyone else understood how valuable the sonic boom skill was as they idolized Captain Kerlin.After those horny students from the Seventh National Male Middle School had trekked about 30km, they finally arrived at their resting point as they heavily panted, feeling like tortoises with the luggage on their backs. They were at the westernmost railway station that was nearby the Glang Iron Mine northwest of Blackhot City. Passing that railway station, the rails would gradually extend towards the Glang Iron Mine in the north. The trains that commuted between Blackhot City and Glang Iron Mine were responsible for the transportation of goods and as well as commuting between the two locations. As the iron ores from the mines supported the prosperity of Blackhot City, the trains would transport them to the steel-making mills in Blackhot City every day. Glang Iron Mine, which contained more than 6 billion tons of iron ores, was the largest iron mine in the Andaman Alliance and was even ranked 3rd in the entire Blackson Human Clan Corridor. Half of Blackhot City was established by this super iron mine.Taking a rest nearby the railway station, Zhang Tie and the others saw their companions, those horny students from the Second National Male Middle School, arriving twenty minutes later. Following them, the next to arrive was the Fourth National Female Middle School and the Eleventh National Female Middle School. Seeing the charming female students, all the horny male students turned to stone as they drooled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ever since he was born, he had never once seen so many enchanting female students. Before those female students drew close, with the help of a breeze, the various fragrances from those girls carried by the breeze had already excited the horny students so much that they began to growl.Wherever the female students went, they would always cause those horny male students to jump up from the ground as if they had been possessed by ghosts. Making cool gestures, they raised their chests and gazed at those female students who were passing by.Under the gazes of those horny male students, the female students arrogantly raised their heads like peacocks. At the front of the line were several solemn female teachers and coaches who were glancing at those horny male students on the roadside with a stern look. Behind the female teachers and coaches, some of the female students kept looking ahead, while the others bashfully stared at those foolish guys.In total, there were more than a thousand female students from those two national female schools, causing Zhang Tie to be dazed\u2026\u201cSo huge\u2026\u201d Hearing that inharmonious voice, Zhang Tie turned around, only to see Hista drooling uncontrollably as his eyes were fixed on a female student with an excellent figure.That girl was tall and plump. She had short red hair and wore a delicate, close-fitting leather armor that made the features of her elegant figure stand out. At the sight of that female student, Zhang Tie was immediately attracted by her plump breasts and forcefully swallowed his saliva.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know whether she had heard Hista\u2019s remark or had noticed Zhang Tie and Hista\u2019s rude gaze, but as she suddenly turned her delicate face around, she shot a furious gaze at the two. Because of that conspicuous black pot on Zhang Tie\u2019s back, she could not help but give him another fierce glare.\u201cKristine, what happened?\u201d a slightly petite girl beside the red-haired female student asked her. \u201cNothing, I just saw a boring guy with a black pot on his back,\u201d the sexy red-haired female student replied.\u201cTake care of yourself. The teachers have warned us that those male students are dirty rascals. Although we still have to complete our survival training in conjunction with them and may need their help, we still need to keep a distance from them. If they are too close to you, they might do something disgusting and terrifying!\u201d\u201cI know, Shirley. If anyone dares to do something disgusting to me, I will use this to castrate him!\u201d the red-haired female ferociously said as she patted the short sword on her back. In her mind, the image of the guy carrying the black pot flashed through her mind. The distant Zhang Tie suddenly felt an inexplicable chill.\u201cI have heard that those male students only need to remember how you look. Even if they\u2019re not near you, they would think about doing disgusting and terrifying things to you!\u201d\u201cAh? That is so disgusting!\u201d The female student called Kristine was so frightened that she suddenly turned pale. \u201cShirley, what should we do then?\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t remember you\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026After meeting those cute female students in the westernmost railway station of Blackhot City, all the horny students immediately became highly spirited. The male students didn\u2019t want to lose face in front of those female students, and neither did the female students want to lose face in front of those horny male students. Hence, during the remaining 40km journey, the male students from the two national male middle schools competed with each other, while the female students from the two national female middle schools gritted their teeth and tried not to give off a weak appearance.After leaving that railway station, they saw fewer and fewer people, and the roads became narrower. The roads were covered with weeds, and the nearby trees and plants were much taller and were lusher. In addition, there were more and more sounds of various insects, birds, and other animals. Gradually, they entered the twisting hills neighboring the Blackhot Mountain Range.Continuing on this path, after traveling for an hour, they would take a 15 minute break. Finally, before the sun had set, they saw a huge, magnificent castle at the top of a mountain 1km away from them. The setting sun was cast onto the castle, which caused the castle to give off a rose-golden color, making people feel as if it was a kingdom from a fairytale.\u201cWild Wolf Castle! We have arrived!\u201d someone shouted. Everyone then began cheering. Plucking up their courage, they surged towards that castle.10 minutes later, some of the faster guys had already arrived at the foot of the castle, after which more and more people arrived. Carrying his heavy luggage, Zhang Tie was neither fast nor slow. He entered the Wild Wolf Castle together with the majority of the students from the Seventh National Male Middle School. Afterwards, everyone was shocked by the Wild Wolf Castle and the Wild Wolf Valley which it protected.The castle\u2019s appearance was a typical western castle, and it occupied the highest point on the mountain. It comprised of two parts: an internal castle and an external castle. Standing in the granite square outside the castle, Zhang Tie raised his head and could only see the tall wall of the external castle that was 30m in height. Within the wall, there was an arrow tower as well as some other powerful city defense equipment.Standing in the square in front of the castle, the instant Zhang Tie moved his gaze from the castle to the Wild Wolf Valley beneath it, he was able to see the entire Wild Wolf Valley.At dusk, Wild Wolf Valley was more or less quite dim. It was an irregular, trumpet-shaped valley that was more than 30km in length, and had many intersecting mountain ridges and hills. What left an impression on Zhang Tie the most was the exaggerated number of caves on the hills and mountains that surrounded the entire valley. Some of them looked similar to abandoned mines, while nobody knew how the other caves came into being. There were many of those strange caves everywhere. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know why, but when he looked at those weird caves, Zhang Tie felt that something was weird about Wild Wolf Valley.Wild Wolf Castle rightly occupied an important spot on the eastern side of the trumpet-shaped Wild Wolf Valley.This was where the numerous horny students would show off their survival skills in the coming two months.Standing at the top of the mountain, Zhang Tie sucked in a deep breath and muttered, \u201cAt least I can breathe quality air here.\u201dMore than 10 minutes after those male students had arrived, the female students from the two national female middle schools also arrived. Different from those horny students, all the female students entered the castle while chatting with each other. Less than 10 minutes after the female students had entered the castle, a company of soldiers safeguarding the castle orderly departed from the castle as they rode on their war horses, soon disappearing behind the mountain.When the teachers and coaches were counting the number of students from each school, Zhang Tie and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood occupied a patch of land in the square outside the castle as they unloaded their luggage. Sitting on the ground in a fatigued manner, they rubbed their swollen shoulders and numb legs.\u201c20 years ago, this was the westernmost war castle of Blackhot City. Nowadays, the westernmost war castle of Blackhot City has been pushed to the one that occupied the point 200km west of Blackhot City, thus this Wild Wolf Castle has gradually lost its uses. Only a company worth of soldiers would be dispatched here to perform maintenance on the war castle, and they had just left. Now, the right to use this war castle has been transferred to these schools!\u201d\u201cIf only we could sleep in the castle tonight! There are more than 1000 female students. They must be lonely over there!\u201d Hista, the rascal, said admiringly as he stared at those narrow, shiny windows.\u201cIf you castrate yourself, you might be able to enter. There is not even a single man inside the inner castle of Wild Wolf Castle. Even the male teachers and coaches of the two national male middle schools are forbidden to enter. I heard those female teachers and coaches from the two female national middle schools are old, abnormal virgins. In Blackhot City, once any man made a mistake, they could only f*ck beauties in their dreams for the rest of their lives!\u201d Leit said emotionlessly as he shrugged his shoulders.Hearing Leit\u2019s words, all the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood felt a chill at their crotches and drew their legs closer.\u201cHadn\u2019t something happened during the past survival trainings?\u201d Hista doubted. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that with so many beauties in front of us, that the other men would be gentlemen like us!\u201d\u201cYes, there were some incidents; however, those horny guys all died in the end!\u201d\u201cHow could that be possible?\u201d\u201cDuring the survival training, the teachers and coaches would act in accordance with the decree that\u2019s sent out during times of war by the Andaman Alliance, so you should know how they would treat people who violate the rules!\u201dHearing Leit\u2019s words, Hista started to touch his neck\u2026Later on, when all the horny students were resting in the square, the teachers and coaches began to tell the rules to the horny students and thus verifying what Barley and Leit had said.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFirstly, all the horny students were allowed to sleep in the square of Wild Wolf Castle tonight, but none of them were allowed to be sleeping here when the first rays of the sun shone tomorrow. Afterwards, they are expected to stay in Wild Wolf Valley. This square will be used to do trading, form teams, organize activities, and accept missions. The square will be open from 8am to 6pm every day.Secondly, from now on, they will have act according to the wartime decree of the Andaman Alliance. Any dispute will be dealt with accordingly. Teachers from the four school have already formed a temporary committee that will supervise them. The committee will ensure the successful completion of the survival training and will also execute the wartime decree during the duration of the survival training.Thirdly, the toilets in the external castle are open for all the horny students tonight. Nobody is allowed to casually expel their waste. Anyone who is caught dirtying the areas of Wild Wolf Castle would suffer a miserable punishment once caught\u2026Two hours later when it became completely dark outside, fires were lit from several huge fire baskets. Those horny students had already spread their own sleeping bags on the square. After eating some food and going to the toilet, they felt too fatigued and soon fell asleep.Zhang Tie hid himself in the sleeping bag in the smooth, granite square. Hearing those growls from the wild wolves in the Wild Wolf Valley, he trembled and could not sleep well throughout the night\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We\u2019re setting off\u2026\u201dDue to his poor Qi and blood, Zhang Tie\u2019s biological clock had been delayed for the past couple of days. The next morning, Fatty Barley woke up Zhang Tie by shaking him. Opening his eyes, Zhang Tie realized it was almost dawn, as the last star was still hanging in the eastern parts of the sky. After spending an entire night sleeping on a sturdy stone, Zhang Tie felt a tinge of pain on the back of his head.Seeing that both Fatty Barley and Doug had already awoken, Zhang Tie also hurriedly climbed out of his sleeping bag and started to pack his luggage. The day had not broken yet; however, the horny students in the square had already woken up one by one and were preparing for the upcoming survival training.\u201cI\u2019ve noticed that more than ten groups have already left. It\u2019s our turn now!\u201d Fatty Barley said as he arranged his luggage.\u201cDid you wake up early?\u201d rolling up his sleeping bag, Zhang Tie asked Barley.\u201cOf course, I woke up early. Afterwards, I began to count the number of groups that had left. Those guys will find a path for us, and we will follow them. It won\u2019t be good if we\u2019re too early or too late.\u201d\u201cThis fatty is truly cunning.\u201d Zhang Tie admired inwardly. \u201cBut it\u2019s really reassuring to have him as a brother.\u201dPicking himself up from the ground, Zhang Tie glanced at where Glaze\u2019s group had stayed last night. As he predicted, the four people had already disappeared. It seemed that they had already climbed down the mountain a long time ago. As this survival training was the final chance for Glaze, he might be more anxious than anyone else to perform well.The seven members of the Hit-Plane Brother arranged their luggage quickly and then followed the over ten groups that had departed earlier from the square outside Wild Wolf Castle. Leading to the valley below was a 200m long path paved with broken stones from the square. Walking along the path that twisted around the mountain, they entered the valley. Two other groups walked alongside the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood before splitting up with them at the bottom of the mountain. From this point on, they had become opponents to the other groups, as there were limited inhabitable places and resources in the valley that could only be gained through luck and fighting.On the first day of the survival training, everyone\u2019s first test was to search for a suitable place to stay.In the wild, a proper place to stay had to meet the following three conditions: first, it had to be close to a clean water source; second, it had to be sufficiently safe; third, it had to be in a place that was convenient for them to gather enough food in the future.Although they could feel safe and would be close to a clean water source if they stayed near the castle, it would be difficult to gather enough food. Based on the experiences of those from the previous years, most people chose to stay about 1-7 km away from the castle, though some arrogant people or groups with many members would choose a place a bit farther to stay.With an axe in hand, Bagdad cleared the path before them as Doug, Barley, and Zhang Tie followed. Hista and Sharwin followed behind Zhang Tie, and Leit stayed at the end of the line. Everybody held their weapons and entered the valley cautiously. They couldn\u2019t be careless here because just as they walked down the path, Doug had stepped into a pile of feces from some unknown beast, who seemed to have left it here last night. When Doug cursed loudly, they all felt a chill in their hearts. They once again reminded themselves that this was Wild Wolf Valley and not Blackhot City.After walking for 200m in the valley, Sharwin found a water-leaf willow. He then picked up several willow twigs and distributed them to the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. They then chewed the willow twigs for the water inside the twigs, using it to wash their mouths. In the wild, they had to be frugal. As it was early in the morning, the temperature in the valley was still a bit low. The valley was still covered with a thin layer of fog, and dew was still on the leaves of the trees and in the grass. After walking for a while, a small portion of their clothes had gotten wet.The \u201cgugugu\u201d sound from some unknown birds on the trees reverberated from far away. The valley then gradually became quiet.After traveling less than 500m since they entered the valley, they encountered their first wolf. When Bagdad was waving the huge axe to clear the path, a wolf that had been resting in the grass 20m away suddenly stood up. After staring at them, it immediately turned back and disappeared into the woods before they could respond.The sight of the wolf naturally made everybody tightly grip their weapons.After walking another 1km, they found a crystal stream with a width of more than 5 meters. The river was so translucent that they could even clearly see the cobblestones and the water weeds at the bottom as well as a shoal of small fish that was swimming happily among the water weeds.\u201cI suggest we go deep into the valley along the river. It would be great if we could find an inhabitable place along the river!\u201d Bagdad uttered.\u201cFine!\u201d Everybody agreed. Thus, they descended into the valley along the river. After another 1km, they passed by an abandoned mine. Surrounding that mine were several caves in the mountains nearby. The two groups that had arrived earlier had already occupied two of those caves. Seeing the huge and perfectly round caves in the precipices and the ridges, Doug asked curiously, \u201cHow could there be so many strange caves in the precipices?\u201d\u201cI heard that there used to be Gold-Eating Boas who would twist over there in the past and would bore holes for themselves, but later on, they were exterminated by humans. As a result, those holes were left\u2026\u201dSharwin said.\u201cCaves of Gold-Eating Boas?\u201d Doug asked surprisingly. Seeing those round caves in the precipices and the ridges whose diameters varied from 1m to 3m, Zhang Tie forcefully swallowed his saliva. He tried to imagine how large those Gold-Eating Boas would be if those caves were the size of the Gold-Eating Boas. At this thought, Zhang Tie\u2019s legs felt weak, and he felt despair when he looked at those pitch black holes.\u201cOf course, you didn\u2019t know that?\u201d Sharwin asked curiously.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d turning pale, Leit asked Sharwin.\u201cI read about it from the local chronicles of Blackhot City\u2026\u201d Sharwin said without any hesitation. \u201cI remember that these Gold-Eating Boas from the Wild Wolf Valley were recorded in the local chronicles of Blackhot City more than 30 years ago. It was said that these Gold-Eating Boas were as old as 1000 years. At that time, in order to eliminate them, the whole Blackson Human Clan Corridor had to take action and numerous high-level fighters arrived from all directions. With the cooperation between the armies and the numerous high-level fighters, they were finally able to kill them all. After that, Blackhot City found an iron mine and a high-quality crystal mine. Tens of years later, nowadays, the crystal mine has almost been completely depleted and became useless. In contrast, the iron mine was completely deserted when the Glang Iron Mine was discovered. They had transferred the personnel over to the Glang Iron Mine due to this mine being more costly and producing lower quality iron ores, thus this iron mine was gradually abandoned. After the Gold-Eating Boas were killed, the population of the wild wolves sharply increased. Seeing so many wild wolves here, they named this place as the Wild Wolf Valley\u2026\u201dNaturally, nobody in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, with the exception of Sharwin, would be bored enough to read the local chronicles of Blackhot City. Although this event had happened more than 30 years ago, it was still terrifying to them even now.\u201cWhat if they didn\u2019t kill them all and had left a small one\u2026\u201d Doug muttered.With the sound of \u201cgulu\u201d, everybody forcefully swallowed their saliva. Looking at those mountain caves once again, they dared not to live inside them anymore.\u201cI think we\u2019re better off not going too deep into the valley. If we can\u2019t find a suitable place to stay after another 2 km, we should turn back\u2026\u201d Fatty Barley immediately suggested with a solemn look.Everybody hurriedly nodded, and even Bagdad didn\u2019t object. Thinking of how this place used to be teething with huge snakes and monsters that were as long as 100m and could even eat the stones before them, everyone had an inexplicable feeling about Wild Wolf Valley.After searching for about 4 hours, the seven members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood finally found a place that was about 5 km away from Wild Wolf Castle. There was a Dragon-Claw Tree with a diameter of more than 10m near the small woods. Unknown whether or not this was a mutated species, this Dragon-Claw Tree that was covered in lumps was the largest one they had ever seen. Its height was greater than 50m, and at the top of the tree was a cloud-like crown, which covered several mu of land. Previously, seeing the tree, they had wanted to take a rest over there, but they ended up finding a hollow cave on the tree that was 4m away from the ground. Climbing onto the tree, Bagdad took a peep inside and surprisingly found that the inside of the hollow cave was very spacious and could easily hold three people. What was more marvelous was that someone had once lived inside; this should have been the living place of someone who had previously attended the survival training. Everybody then became excited. Each of them climbed onto the tree to peep inside. Fortunately, they found another natural hollow cave, which was much smaller than the first one and could only hold one person, 7m above the ground on the same tree. Even with the two hollow caves, the Dragon-Claw Tree still looked very green; however, the wood inside the tree had already become completely rotten. It seemed as if it had been struck by lightning, as one could easily grab some wood scraps from the inside of the hollow cave.\u201cWhy not renovate it into a place that could hold the seven of us?\u201d Leit\u2019s words made everybody spirited. It could already hold four people and it did not seem difficult to further renovate it, thus everyone immediately started to work.The renovation was composed of two steps. The first step was to expand the space of the two hollow caves as much as possible. The lower cave should be able to hold four people, their equipment, and food, while the upper cave should be expanded as much as possible. If it was expanded to be as large as the lower cave, then it would be able to hold another three people and they would all be able to live inside.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter expanding the inner space of the two tree caves, they would arrive at the second step of renovation: breaking through the two hollow caves by leaving an \u201cN\u201d-shaped path between them. At least two or three people could sleep in the \u201cN\u201d-shaped space, so they would not feel cramped inside the caves.As they had learned some preliminary carpenter\u2019s skills at school and didn\u2019t need to make it nice-looking and delicate, they could easily do this kind of work.Bagdad waved his axe together while Zhang Tie and Leit used their multi-purpose military shovels. With wood scraps flying everywhere, it only took them over two hours to finish the work on the lower hollow cave.Seeing those wood scraps inside the hollow caves, Barley shouted, \u201cAh, don\u2019t throw them away. These dried wood scraps can be used as firewood. We will not have to worry about lacking firewood for the next couple of weeks\u2026\u201dEverybody burst out into laughter\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Using his multipurpose military shovel, Zhang Tie dug in the upper hole in the tree. The military shovel could become a miniature hoe by folding the foldable shovel head vertically into each other. One edge of the head of the hoe was very sharp and could be used as a miniature axe, while the other edge was full of jagged teeth and could be used as a saw. While humming a tune, Zhang Tie flicked the shovel to clean off the rotten woods in the cave. As everyone found it refreshing and interesting to live in tree hollows, they worked really hard.Barley and Sharwin were responsible for making a fire to cook supper that would be cooked in the huge black pot on the stone hearth, and Doug and Hista were responsible for sending out warnings for any danger within 50m, while Zhang Tie, Bagdad, and Leit were responsible for the renovation of the holes in the trees.After renovating the lower hole, the three of them placed all their attention onto the upper hole. Compared to the lower hole, the upper hole required more work. As the upper hole had a limited amount of space and only had enough space to allow one person to enter for the first time, only when the first person had expanded the size inside could a second person enter. Thus, it was slower to renovate the upper hole. Zhang Tie was the first one to enter the upper hole. One hour later, Zhang Tie exited the hole and replacing him was Leit. After another hour, Leit exited and Bagdad entered. After two more hours, the space inside could already barely hold two people, thus as Bagdad left, Zhang Tie and Leit entered again. After another hour of work, Bagdad could push himself in as well. From then on, the renovation work for the upper hole started to accelerate.At noon, several groups of students from the Second National Male Middle School and the Seventh National Male Middle School also noticed the renovated tree hollows. Two groups of guys from the Second National Male Middle School had even intended to chase away the Hit-Plane Brotherhood by relying on their superior numbers, but when Doug held the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d and aimed it at those malicious fellows, they could only reluctantly leave as the corners of their eyes twitched. They would never have imagined that the Hit-Plane Brotherhood would be so crazy to even bring along the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d. The \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d was a machine-driven crossbow with two strings, and the two strings could be pulled simultaneously, allowing one to shoot two arrows at the same time. The arrows shot from the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d could pierce through an armored human body as long as it was within a distance of 50m. Anyone who wanted the tree hollows would suffer a miserable loss once Doug pulled the trigger of the bow twice. Naturally, nobody dared to trespass in their territory. As it was merely a place to stay, casualties were not worth it.Working through the entire afternoon, they finally finished renovating the upper hole just as dusk was about to fall. At the time of completion, the upper hole could barely allow two people to lay inside; however, having two people lay inside and having three people stand inside were completely different matters, as the three people standing would all feel a bit exhausted. Finally, Leit couldn\u2019t stand anymore and was replaced by Hista. Bagdad and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brother were really amazed that Zhang Tie could stand as long as Bagdad. They were even in awe at Zhang Tie, who looked as normal as before. For Zhang Tie, he had indirectly showed his strength as a LV 1 fighter and could even surpass Bagdad by a bit at that moment. After igniting his Shrine burning point, Zhang Tie\u2019s physique had already improved greatly, quickly narrowing the gap between the physique of a Chinese and that of another human race. Certainly, if Bagdad had also ignited his Shrine burning point and had gained the same benefits as him, then Zhang Tie knew that he would not be his match. But, how could Bagdad ignite his Shrine burning point as fast as him?After thinking through this point, Zhang Tie became more confident of being able to successfully complete the survival training.In the evening, the aroma drifting from the hot pot of soup made everyone feel hungry. Naturally, when Barley called them, everybody took their own food container and moved around that pot of hot soup. Compressed dry food plus a bowl of hot meat soup\u2014\u2014it was simply perfect!Inside the soup were the dried beef brought by Barley and the wild fiddlehead foraged by Sharwin. After boiling them in lightly salted water, they ended up with the delicious soup.Everybody was satisfied with this supper. After supper, they cleaned their dinnerware in the small stream a few dozen meters away. When they all returned, they all sat by the bonfire under the tree as they discussed their next course of action.\u201cI think it will take us another day to finish the second stage of the renovation, after which we would be able to completely put the two holes to use. The food that we had brought with us will only last one week. For the remaining two months, we will have to gather food by ourselves. Considering how we all eat from the same big pot, in theory, we should all submit about a kilogram of food each day,\u201d Barley said solemnly as he glanced over every member of the brotherhood. \u201cSince this survival training is dangerous, we might lose our lives when searching for food. We have to take this seriously. As we are brothers and will eat together, we have to consider our collective interests as well as our individual interests when it comes to obtaining food and its distribution. We will not force any member of the brotherhood to do something that is inconsistent with the principles of our brotherhood. I\u2019ve already thought up a plan for food allocation. Let\u2019s discuss about that\u2026\u201dBarley then poured out the details of his distribution plan. The food collected through a group effort will be evenly distributed and consumed by all the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. If an individual acquires food by themselves, then it will be dealt according to its weight. For amounts less than 1kg, since they all ate from the same big pot, it should be used to replenish the group\u2019s food supply, so that will belong to the group. For amounts that weighed between 1kg and 3kg, it will belong to the individual\u2019s emergency food supply, which should be safely stored somewhere and would only be used in times of emergency. As everyone has to eat, if someone in the group has an insufficient amount, someone else would have to bail you out. For amounts greater than 3kg, it will depend on the individual who found it. They could send it to others, use it seduce girls, or exchange it for other things at Wild Wolf Castle. That person could also contribute the food to the Hit-Plane Brotherhood in exchange for credits worth the same in the market of Blackhot City. The credits could then be exchanged for a ticket when it accumulated to a certain degree. Using Barley as an example, that fatty had two vote tickets because of his contributions to the Hit-Plane Brotherhood.After Barley declared his plan, everybody agreed after a short discussion. It truly considered both their individual interests as well as the collective interests of the group.\u201cIf I submit more than 1 kg of food every day, can I freely do my own thing for the rest of the time?\u201d Zhang Tie asked Barley.\u201cYou can be free to do your own thing. However, at our tree base, from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm every day, we must have at least one person on duty that will cook. In addition, we will take turns being on duty; one will stay on duty from 6:00 pm to 0:00 am, and someone else will replace him from 0:00 am to 8:00 am. As long as you submit enough food and will not disturb the other members, you are free to do whatever you want during the rest of the time!\u201d After explaining, Barley curiously looked at Zhang Tie and gave him a suggestion, \u201cBighead, it\u2019s dangerous to act alone. As we are brothers, we should work together for the sake of our safety!\u201d\u201cThe thing I want to do is probably something you guys don\u2019t want to do!\u201d Zhang Tie smiled.Bagdad raised his chest and replied, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear. If you want to fight Glaze\u2019s group, we brothers will support you!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d the rest of the people said in unison.\u201cI want to dig in the mines. Do you still want to go with me?\u201d Zhang Tie said as he stared at those guys. Hearing his words, everyone\u2019s eyes opened widely.\u201cDig in the mines? You want to dig in the mines?\u201d with his mouth gaping, Barley asked.\u201cI know how you guys see those who aren\u2019t able to find food and have to suffer bitter feelings because they couldn\u2019t find enough food to complete the survival training. But, I really do find mining to be fun!\u201d Zhang Tie blinked as he naively looked at them. \u201cI have always felt since I was young that mining was interesting. Since I have the opportunity, I must seize this chance!\u201d\u201cBrother, you will regret it!\u201d Hista sincerely suggested. \u201cThis survival training is our test and is also an opportunity arranged by Blackhot City for us to get acquainted with and perhaps even marry those girls. No girl would like a man who isn\u2019t even able to gather sufficient amounts of food through hunting and would rather just make himself dirty in the caves. The people who had dug in the mines there in the past years were just guys with bad luck. Most of them were even single.\u201d\u201cSince this has been one of my dreams since I was a kid, I would still like to give it a try. If it\u2019s not interesting, then I\u2019ll just come back!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the corner of everybody\u2019s mouths began to twitch. They became speechless. Even Barley couldn\u2019t think it through. Since Zhang Tie was such a smart kid, why did he want to be a miner when he was a kid? Though, he wasn\u2019t one to speak since he had dreamed to become a prestigious concierge when he was a child.Seeing the looks of amazements on their faces, Zhang Tie apologized inwardly, \u201cSorry, brothers! This survival training means different things for you and I. For you, you are here to gather sufficient food and perhaps even earn the favor of those girls, but I am here to gather enough energy for my Castle of Black Iron. I don\u2019t know where else I could replenish my Castle of Black Iron\u2019s basic energy storage. It would be difficult for me to find an opportunity in a short period of time once we return back to Blackhot City or some other destination.\u201dBefore the survival training had begun, Zhang Tie had already decided that his goal for the survival training was to make the Castle of Black Iron grow stronger. After learning of the effects of the first Leakless Fruit and surviving his first life and death encounter, Zhang Tie obtained a deep understanding of the changes and hopes that the Castle of Black Iron had brought. The Castle of Black Iron and that small tree were his two top-guarded secrets, ones which were closely related to his fate. Because of the Castle of Black Iron and that marvelous tree, Zhang Tie had already stepped onto a road that was completely different from the others. When compared to the Castle of Black Iron and the marvelous tree, a little bit of food, the looks of ridicules, and the mocking from others became nothing significant.As Zhang Tie and the others were idly chatting under the tree, Doug, who had run towards the grass to relieve his bowels, suddenly shrieked, causing all the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood to grab their weapons and rush towards him. Bagdad and Zhang Tie rushed forward shoulder in shoulder, causing Bagdad to cast a look of amazement at Zhang Tie. When they drew close to Doug, everybody gaped\u2026With his trousers off, Doug was crying as he jumped around in the grass while covering his bottom. \u201cAhh, my ass! These bastards\u2026 Can\u2019t they even let me take a sh*t?\u201dSeeing the members of the brotherhood running towards him, with dripping tears, Doug ran towards them with his bottom exposed as if he had just seen his saviors. \u201cHelp! Quick! Help me take a look. My ass was just bitten by something\u2026 I think it might be poisonous\u2026 I\u2019m going to die\u2026 Help!\u201dWithout even having pulled up his trousers, Doug ran towards the group, inevitably tripping on his trousers and falling onto the ground. When Doug fell, Zhang Tie clearly saw a bloody mark on his swollen left butt cheek.Bagdad hurriedly helped Doug up as Zhang Tie rushed towards where Doug had just been. That guy had just left a landmine\u2014\u2014there was a pile of sh*t over there. The moment Zhang Tie arrived there, the odor almost made him vomit; however, compared to the life of his brother, the smell was nothing serious. Zhang Tie wanted to figure out what had bitten Doug, so he could quickly cure him with the right medicine.As he ran over there, Zhang Tie casually broke a twig. When he arrived, Zhang Tie held his breath and started to search for the thing that had bitten Doug at the place where he had squatted. Luckily, he soon found a blue-gray scorpion which had its tail raised in the patch of grass beside the \u201clandmine\u201d; it was currently preparing to attack Zhang Tie. The instant Zhang Tie saw it, he became relaxed; however, the smelly odor almost made Zhang Tie roll backwards. He hurried broke the twig into two halves and nipped the scorpion as if he was nipping vegetables with a pair of chopsticks.\u201cAh! It\u2019s so painful! I\u2019m going to die\u2026 Hurry, brothers! Someone help me suck out the poison. If not, I really will die soon. I already feel numb in half my body. Ah\u2026 I feel cold\u2026 Hurry up\u2026 Ah\u2026\u201d Doug cried miserably over there as he glanced at the other members of Hit-Plane Brotherhood, who showed weird expressions. Before Zhang Tie returned, every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood looked pale and had a solemn look on their faces; they looked as if they were making a choice of life or death as they stared at the swollen spot on Doug\u2019s butt. The atmosphere was very weird. They looked at each other and became speechless. Sucking out the poison wasn\u2019t a problem, but someone would have to put their mouth on Doug\u2019s butt. That\u2026 That\u2026As they were drawing lots, at the sight of Zhang Tie, who was walking towards them with the scorpion, everyone hurriedly rushed forward as if they had seen their savior.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing serious. It\u2019s just an ordinary blue-gray scorpion, which isn\u2019t very poisonous. Those who had been bitten will recover after a day of rest\u2026\u201d As he said that, Zhang Tie showed the scorpion to the others. Whoop! Everybody became relaxed. At the same time, Doug, who was crying about how that poisonous fluid had flowed into his heart and how half his body had already felt numb, shut his mouth.It was just an ordinary blue-gray scorpion which had a little toxicity. Those who were bitten would only feel a little bit of pain, and at most, it would slightly affect their actions temporarily; it was nothing serious. After becoming relaxed, they realized something and then shot Doug, who was still lying on his stomach, a furious glare. What a bastard! Thinking of how Doug said that half his body already felt numb and the poisonous fluid had flowed into his heart, they realized they were almost cheated by him. At this realization, when they had come to terms with what the consequences of being cheated by Doug would have been, everybody became furious inside\u2026Moving forward with an obscene smile, Barley said, \u201cYou said that you felt half your body being numb?\u201d\u201cKaka!\u201d With a pinch of his fingers, Bagdad also gloomily walked over. \u201cYou also said you had started to feel cold\u2026\u201d\u201cPoisonous fluid had already arrived at your heart?\u201d Leit asked solemnly with arms crossed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWere you planning to let us suck out the poison from your butt?\u201d Hista smiled obscenely.\u201cYou are a liar!\u201d Sharwin pouted.Feeling as if something was not right, Doug immediately pulled up his trousers and stood up. Seeing his movement, even Zhang Tie frowned and became speechless. \u201cHe seems to have not even cleaned his butt. He\u2019s\u2026 really\u2026 really\u2026 great!\u201d\u201cI\u2026 just now\u2026 was too nervous. Right, I was too nervous, so my body had the wrong feelings!\u201d Doug stammered.\u201cFelt the wrong feelings? We\u2019ll help you correct it. I remember a method. We don\u2019t need to suck out the poisonous fluid for you; there\u2019s a mystical oriental treatment where we just beat your wounds to help the poisonous fluid flow out\u201d Saying that, Bagdad kicked Doug\u2019s wound, causing him to cry out miserably. The instant Doug intended to escape, he was caught by Bagdad. Afterwards, with the exception of Zhang Tie, everybody charged at him. In the next three minutes, Doug, who had just been stung by a scorpion, got to experience the \u201cbeating treatment\u201d and its effects\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_After a day of rest, Doug was already able to freely move in the next evening. At the sight of his sad and furious face, every member of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood could not help but laugh out loudly. On the first day of the survival training, Doug had been stung by a scorpion on his snow-white butt when he was squatting in the grass to relieve his bowels. Thankfully, that was only an ordinary blue-gray scorpion which had low toxicity, and he was able to freely move only one day after his brothers\u2019 \u201cbeating treatment\u201d. That incident caused everyone to be alert; they had started to realize what the farmer meant when he said, \u201cDon\u2019t expose your butt in the air.\u201d What if it was a mutated scorpion with extremely high toxicity? What if it was a snake with extremely toxic venom or a fatally poisonous insect? If that was the case, Doug might have already become a corpse.Nobody wanted to be bitten by something while they squatted on the ground or in the grass relaxedly like Doug had. After realizing the potential dangers, everyone, with the exception of Doug, had built a toilet that was not too far away from the tree hollows on the first evening of the survival training. Barley had even sprayed some medicinal powder used to repel poisonous animals on the ground around the toilet and as well as the area around the Dragon-Claw Tree.During the daytime of the second day, with the exception of Doug, who was still lying in the hole to recover, everyone continued to expand the tree hollows using the axe, military shovel, dagger, and machete. They had basically completed the second step of the renovation of their tree hollow, successfully expanding the hollows into three spacious floors, which was sufficient for seven people to sleep inside.After eating for two days, the total amount of food had dropped below 30 kg, which would only feed them for four days at most. They had started to feel pressure from the limited basic living necessities, thus on the third day of the survival training, everyone had decided to go and forage for food.Due to his Qi, blood, and spiritual energy having recovered, Zhang Tie\u2019s woke him up from his sweet dream at about 6:00 am; he was the one to wake up the earliest. Opening his eyes, he saw the traces of the top of the hole having been chopped. His crystal clear senses had been recovered, as he could easily identify which tools or which weapons had created those marks. Previously, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t do that at all. Could his growing spiritual energy be making him smarter and giving him sharper senses? After thinking about it for a while, Zhang Tie immediately got up. Knowing that the Leakless Fruit will continue to ripen again, he felt much better and felt as if his life was full of hope.The one lying in the same upper hole with Zhang Tie was Hista. When Zhang Tie woke up, Hista was still snoring. Those from the hole under them seemed to have not woken up yet either, thus after putting on his clothes and shoes, Zhang Tie equipped his soft armor and fastened his waistband. After checking his personal equipment, he silently climbed out of the tree hollow. For adolescents like Zhang Tie, it was not difficult to climb up and down from the high and twisting, lump-covered Dragon-Claw Tree.Since midnight, Leit had been on duty. Hugging the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d, he sat in a pit that was a meter deep under the lower tree hollow with widely opened eyes. Seeing Zhang Tie climbing down, he was pretty surprised. \u201cSo early?\u201d\u201cHoho, the early bird gets the worms!\u201d\u201cThe worms that get up early will be eaten by the bird. Do you really want to give it a try?\u201dZhang Tie nodded. \u201cYes!\u201d\u201cGood luck!\u201d Leit stopped trying to persuade Zhang Tie. In his opinion, Zhang Tie would definitely come back after suffering from a couple of setbacks. Mining during the survival training was not that easy.Waving his hands towards Leit, Zhang Tie climbed down the tree and quickly disappeared from their camp\u2026Morning in the valley was different from that in the cities, as there was a fresh fragrance lingering here. Leaving the tree, Zhang Tie greedily inhaled the fresh air that contained the aura of the wild plants. He then ran towards the small stream not far away. Arriving at the small, crystal-clear stream where the members of the brotherhood fetched water, he washed his face. He then broke a water-leaf willow twig and used it to clean his mouth. After drinking two mouths of the mountain spring water and eating a small piece of dried ration, Zhang Tie started to take action.Before heading to the mines, another idea popped up in his mind, one which he had always dreamt of but failed in practice. If he was successful, he would not have to be worried about food anymore and would have a lot of time to do what he truly wanted to do. After all, mining was just his excuse to the public; he didn\u2019t really plan to get food from others by mining.While he was an assistant at the grocery store, Zhang Tie had learned various skills and knowledge that would help him survive in the wild from Donder and the pioneers who visited the store. The skills and knowledge learned were not things that could be learned in school; this one, in particular, was about setting traps to capture wild animals. After observing the environment of Wild Wolf Valley for the past two days, Zhang Tie realized he could try out some of the skills and use the methods to acquire food.Zhang Tie cut off a piece of wild bamboo, dividing them into two parts with each being 1m in length. After bundling them together, he left the area. When he passed by a patch of chestnut trees, Zhang Tie found a chestnut tree which was as wide as a duck\u2019s egg and had a height that was greater than 3m. He then used his multi-purpose military shovel to cut that chestnut tree. After cleaning off the extra twigs and leaves on it, Zhang Tie was left with a rod. He then took out the steel spearhead that hung on his waist and nailed it onto the rod, forming a complete spear with a length that was slightly longer than 2m. With that long spear in hand, Zhang Tie became even more dauntless. He then moved towards a place in his memory that was 500m away from the camp with his long spear and the two parts of bamboo in hand.As most of the participants of the survival training chose to stay within 5km of the castle, most of the birds and animals were observed and chased away, while the unlucky ones had already been killed by the participants. Thus, it would be relatively safer within this area, as fewer dangerous beasts were here. Because of this, despite him acting alone, Zhang Tie had nothing to worry about.Before he had arrived at his destination, he had already heard the sound of running water from behind the mountain slope. After detouring that mountain slope, a small river that was as wide as seven or eight meters appeared in front of Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes. Patches of weeds, aquatic plants, and reeds could be found along the streamside. Zhang Tie\u2019s arrival had caused several birds to fly away. Although the river was not crystal clear, it was still clean. Squatting down, Zhang Tie observed along the riverside for about five or six minutes, finding that there were always fish the length of chopsticks jumping out of the water and that there were no other fierce aquatic animals like crocodiles. After a while, Zhang Tie got an idea. Clearing the path using his long spear, he walked towards the upper reach of the stream. At that location, he found several small streams which would converge with the river at several different distances. Every time he saw another small stream, Zhang Tie would stop and carefully take a look; however, in the end, he would shake his head and continued to walk to the upper reaches with a disappointed look. After 700-800m later, Zhang Tie had already seen five small streams, yet none of them made him satisfied. However, as he was blocked by a ravine and a cliff, he could no longer continue. If he wanted to pass, he would have to swim across the river or take a detour around it. Fortunately for Zhang Tie, before he took a detour around the river, he heard the trickling sound of a stream.\u201cWoah!\u201d Zhang Tie stopped. If the sensitivity of his senses were not increased by his spiritual energy which had sharply grown by seven-fold, then Zhang Tie would never have heard the sound that had led him to this extremely hidden place. Clearing the path with his long spear, Zhang Tie walked past the weeds and thorns beside the cliff, heading to the direction where he could hear the trickling sound more clearly. He then continued to search for the origin of that sound along the walls of the cliff and the ravine. After detouring several huge rocks, he saw a 1m wide stream filled with pebbles converging into the river by the cliff and the ravine. The stream could only immerse his feet.At the sight of this stream, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes turned bright.After verifying the location, the slope, the depth, and the quality of the small stream, Zhang Tie made some gestures with his hands before finally making a decision. Fortunately, he had found a suitable place\u2026Inserting the long spear into the ground, Zhang Tie took out his military shovel and removed his shoes as he begun to dig at a place that was not too far from where the small stream led into the river. As he dug, Zhang Tie threw the wet sand and the pebbles to one side of the stream. After digging for more than an hour, he finally built a small pond that was 2m above the point of conversion; it was more than 50 cm deep and was as large as a water vat.After creating that small pond, Zhang Tie picked up the nearby pebbles and built a small dam above it. He then started to smoothen out the 2m long water channel from the small pond to the point of convergence. Removing all the stones and pebbles that were larger than the size of an egg from the water channel, Zhang Tie then paved the water channel with fine sand and pebbles which were smaller than the size of a thumb. He then further reduced the slope of the water channel and made it narrower and deeper\u2026After doing so, Zhang Tie then broke the two parts of bamboo using a dagger and turned them into fine bamboo strips. Using the strips of bamboo and strips of the nearby willow, he weaved them into a funnel-shaped object and placed it at the exit of that pond. By the time he finished doing all of this, it was almost noon\u2026Zhang Tie then took a rest under a tree beside that stream. Wiping the sweat off his forehead, Zhang Tie was satisfied with what he had achieved with this whole morning. The area within 20m from the point where the stream converged into the river to the upper reaches had been totally changed.About 2m onwards from the mouth of the stream, Zhang Tie had slightly changed the slope of the stream, thus the speed of the flowing water was changed and became slower. Zhang Tie had also changed the depth of the stream. Previously, this section of the stream was only 5 to 10 cm in depth, and pebbles were even exposed to the air in some areas, meaning the depth was less than 3 cm. After Zhang Tie had moved the bigger stones and the wet sand away, the depth became more than 20 cm. Above the water channel was a deeper pond, the exit of which was blocked by an ugly, funnel-shaped object created by Zhang Tie; however, although it was rough, it was also the only \u201centrance\u201d to the pond. The opening of that funnel-shaped object was facing the water channel, while its end was in the pond. The simple structure of the funnel-shaped object allowed fish to easily enter, but it would be difficult for it to leave due to the bamboo strips, which did not need to exert any force because of the water flowing against it. However, fish that were wider than 1 inch would not be able to pass through that funnel-shaped object and would be forced back into the pond again.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe funnel-shaped object was the key to this trap. In addition, Zhang Tie had built 8 dams with those larger pebbles at the area 20m from the pond, each of which was about 2-3m in height.Naturally, the dams made of pebbles were not used to block water; they were used to form a natural waterfall to increase the amount of oxygen in the water. After such modification, the water flowing into the stream would definitely contain more oxygen after crashing down eight times. As fish needed oxygen, they would definitely swim upwards from the mouth of the stream and would ultimately fall into that pond. The pond plus that funnel-shaped bamboo formed a natural fish cage; any fish that entered could only stay inside and wait for his arrival.This was a hunting skill that was imparted to him by Donder. Using this skill, with some modifications to the area and given the appropriate terrain and conditions, he would be able to force the fish to enter the trap on their own without having to use a fishing net or a fishing spear. Donder had once said that alcohol, sex, and money was to humans as oxygen was to fish. Those clever traps were based on the prey\u2019s natural characteristics and preferences.After taking a rest for a while under the tree and eating some dried rations for lunch, Zhang Tie found that the water had gradually become crystal clear. The flowing stream soon cleared the mud at the point of convergence, causing ripples. Before leaving, he cut off a verdant twig and used it to cover the pond. Afterwards, as he made his way to Wild Wolf Castle, taking advantage of the elasticity and weight of the twigs on the side of the road, Zhang Tie made another two traps which could be used on small animals. These were also traps that he had learnt about before.He soon arrived at the Wild Wolf Castle, staring with wide open eyes at the sight of the boisterous scene in the castle square.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

With just a slight glance, Zhang Tie knew that there were at least 800-900 people there. The male students were trading goods, mostly food, with the female students. Some of the male students exchanged the prey they had caught with the female students for various wild vegetables, while the other male students formed small groups with the female students in an attempt to get acquainted with each other. With a simple sweep of his glance, Zhang Tie was able to see dozens of horny male students proudly displaying their strong arms and patting their chests in front of the girls. In order to make their weak bicep muscles stand out, some of the seemingly weak guys had even turned red all over, causing the girls to giggle.This was also the most attractive factor in the survival training\u2014once both parties agree, the male students and the female students could form a group to complete the survival training together. As long as the female students return to the castle before 8:00 pm, nobody would interfere with their movements. After several years of compulsory education, which separated the male students from the female students, the sheer terror of talking to the opposite sex was finally conquered. Unless the female students were forced to do something against their will, they could do whatever they wanted. In the end, love was both a trivial matter and an important matter; it was trivial when it was private, but at the same time, it was also important because it is the foundation of the existence of the human race and was something which could not be easily controlled.At the beginning, as female students had the initiative, the horny male students could only try their best to attract girls.For the shy guys, they would get familiar with the girls through exchanging goods and food. For the shameless guys, they would rush towards girls and ask, \u201cBeauties, how about joining us? We\u2019re powerful. If you join us, we promise you will have meat to eat every day!\u201d Most of the guys from this group would then suffer from glares filled with contempt. In contrast, the lucky and power guys who were more experienced with women would directly bring their hunted prey to the square and would loudly shout, inviting girls to eat supper with them. These guys would always easily succeed.A few moments after Zhang Tie arrived at the square, Zhang Tie saw a group of horny students from the Second National Male Middle School carrying a dead boar. Soon after they shouted to invite girls to eat roasted boar in the valley tonight, two groups of girls joined. Feeling spirited, those horny students left together with the two groups of girls. Only at the sight of this scene did Zhang Tie understand why Barley had brought such a huge black pot. Needless to say, he was preparing to attract girls with it, as there was a clear difference between cooking food with a pot and without. Since they had to stay here for two months, no matter how powerful one was, even though one could capture prey every day, one would not be able to find a girl who liked to continuously eat roasted meat for two months\u2026Zhang Tie seemed to see the cunning smile on Fatty\u2019s face!Besides mutual recognition, they could also show off their strength and special abilities in the square. Seeing some of the goods traded by the students, Zhang Tie was amazed. It was only the third day of the survival training, yet someone had already made some practical goods, like bamboo woven mattresses, medicinal herb cages, pillows, wooden stools, bowls, basins, and barrels. Practical application was truly the best way to test one\u2019s talents. Those handmade goods reminded Zhang Tie of the pride of Seventh National Male Middle School, Li Shizhen\u2014the talented Chinese student who was always average school but showed off his exceptionally high talents in medicine by continuously making several types of potent medicine in order to sell it. Immediately following the survival training, he became well known and obtained an opportunity to be recommended by the school. Thus, at this moment, for the students, this survival training was the most important opportunity for them to win a school recommendation.If one had already advanced to become a power fighter, then they would use their strength to kill wild beasts and bring them back\u2026If one had the talent to become a medicinal master, they would create miraculous medicinal pills and medication\u2026If one had a pair of delicate hands and special techniques, they would create something special and show them off\u2026Of course, if one was a good-for-nothing and didn\u2019t even have the confidence to gather food in the wild, then they could only dig in the mines and do laborious work. If one suffered from labor work, then they wouldn\u2019t have to starve to death during the survival training. People who were able to withstand the suffering and do labor work were always needed in human society, as not everyone could be surrounded by glory and fresh flowers.Standing before the outer castle, a few guys were reading the notice on the door. Seeing the missions on the notice, some shook their heads and left, while others looked happy and intended to give it a try\u2026Zhang Tie easily pushed his way through the crowd. Raising his head, he looked at the notice that had just been released.The first mission: Wild Wolf Castle was preparing to create coal, which burns through a large amount of wood in a short period of time. The people with strength but have yet to acquire prey can go get an axe and chop some wood. In exchange for the firewood, one can acquire food. For those who have confidence in their ability to make charcoal, they are free to apply to join this team. Since making charcoal was something that had been taught at school, many students would be able to survive in this manner; however, neither of the two jobs were something to be proud of. Those two jobs would only allow them to survive, temporarily avoiding death by starvation.The second mission: Charcoal was naturally used to smelt iron, and an iron smelting workshop was opened together with the charcoal kiln in Wild Wolf Castle. Besides needing charcoal, they also needed iron ores and people who were confident in their abilities of smelting iron and striking iron. Although they were also skills, iron smelting and iron striking were much more advanced than making charcoal and digging in the mines. Anyone who was able to smelt and strike iron could directly show off without restraint.The third mission: A lot of people are needed to create lime in the lime kiln. As lime was needed to taw numerous hides later, it was a necessity.As for the remaining missions, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t feel like reading them anymore\u2026After scanning the notice, Zhang Tie directly entered Wild Wolf Castle. Entering the gate of the castle, he took a right took and walked for more than 30m. There, he saw a small room in the small square in between the inner castle and the outer castle; it was labeled as \u201cComprehensive Logistics Management\u201d. In front of the door was a desk which was occupied by two girls, who were chatting like a pair of birds, sitting behind it. It was only when Zhang Tie had moved closer to them that they raised their head and glanced over Zhang Tie. At the age of 15, Zhang Tie looked average and was neither tall nor short. His appearance was not particularly pleasing to the eye, but at the very least, he wasn\u2019t irritating to look at. After glancing over Zhang Tie, the girls were not interested. With an official sounding tone, one of the two asked Zhang Tie, \u201cCan I help you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m here to get a shovel and a basket!\u201d Zhang Tie calmly answered.\u201cYou want to dig in the mines?\u201d Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the two girls were startled. They once again glanced over Zhang Tie. The strange look in their eyes had hinted to Zhang Tie that there was some sort of problem.\u201cYes. Although I have not done it before, I find it to be quite interesting, so I want to take this opportunity to experience it\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie replied with a smile without feeling the least bit of embarrassment. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s smile, the strange look in the eyes of the two girls lessened as they looked at each other with a look that seemed to say that male students really do like to do strange things.\u201cFine. Fellow classmate, please show me your student number plate, so I can help you register\u2026\u201dAfter undoing the metal student number plate hanging from his neck, Zhang Tie handed it to her. Each student was given a student number plate when they entered school. It was akin to the identification card used by the students in Blackhot City, but these would not be used during normal times; it was only during the survival training that the schools required the students to bring with them their student number plates. There was a saying among those horny students: the student number plate was used to identify the corpse of any student that had died so miserably that they couldn\u2019t even identify the face.After registering the number from his student number plate, that girl gave it back to Zhang Tie. \u201cI need to warn you that you should not damage the shovel or the basket. If you damage them, you will be asked to pay for them at their original prices. From now on, you are expected to hand in at least 100 kg of iron ores a day. You can exchange them for food; the more ores you hand in, the more food you will get. If you are not able to hand in the minimum amount of ores for three consecutive days, then you will lose your qualification to be a miner. At that point, you will be asked to hand back the shovel and the basket.\u201d\u201cFine. Is there anything else I need to remember?\u201d\u201cDo you know where the abandoned mines are in Wild Wolf Valley?\u201d\u201cYes, I know. The closest one is less than 200m below the castle!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s fine. If you don\u2019t know how to identify iron ore, you can go to the iron smelting workshop to learn about it. They have many samples over there!\u201d As she said this, the girl pointed at a direction in the small square of the outer castle.\u201cFine!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSubmitting 100 kg of iron ore each day was a pretty low requirement. This made Zhang Tie feel reassured that he would have enough time to do what he wanted. It seemed that only a few people wanted to take this job since it was too easy. Most people felt that it was too shameful to do this job since it was prepared for those who were on the brink of starving to death.After telling him about these matters, the girl turned around and entered the warehouse beside her. Less than half a minute later, she returned and brought out a steel shovel as well as a basket. It seemed as if someone had cleaned the two items in the past couple of days; despite not having been used for the past year, it was not dirty at all. Throwing the shovel into the basket, Zhang Tie carried the basket that was higher than a child. Waving his hand to the two girls as he bade them farewell, Zhang Tie awkwardly walked out of Wild Wolf Castle with his spear in handAs expected, his equipment caused everyone on the road to glare at him.The moment he moved past the gates of the castle, Zhang Tie heard a weird voice full of cynicism. \u201cWow, who\u2019s that fish? Isn\u2019t that the brave guy from our school?\u201dTurning his head, Zhang Tie saw Glaze\u2019s group casting a glare full of contempt at him. As the old saying goes\u2014one can not avoid one\u2019s enemy\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One party was a new, miserable miner, while the other party were warriors who had returned with many felled preys. Sharon carried three wolf hides, Garner and Zuhair carried a sheep that weighed more than 40 kg, and Glaze simply crossed his arms, giving off an arrogant feeling.\u201cHow could you be so miserable? You already want to be a miner on the third day? Do you want me to share some meat with you? No matter what, we are still schoolmates. We have thrown so many away. If we had known that you were so miserable, we would have left the wolf meat for you!\u201d Sharon said as he lifted the wolf hides.\u201cOh, I almost forgot. We will be eating sheep meat tonight. If you kneel down in front of Boss Glaze, we might give you some of the soup\u2026\u201d Zuhair sneered by the side.Seeing this group of idiots, Zhang Tie became speechless. Were their brains stuck in sh*t? They only had a LV 2 fighter and three followers, yet they still dared to be arrogant in front of me? Ever since he had killed Snade and Huck, unbeknownst to himself, Zhang Tie had become entirely different than before. He was becoming more and more powerful, both mentally and physically. Before he had even consumed the first Leakless Fruit, he already dared to fight against several people at once, let alone now.\u201cDo you want to be beaten up again?\u201d The instant Zhang Tie shouted that out, the arrogant smirks on the four froze. Zhang Tie\u2019s words were like a sharp dagger, directly reopening their scars.\u201c**\u2026\u201d Sharon\u2019s face twisted. Right as he was about to charge forward, the spear in Zhang Tie\u2019s hand was a step faster, arriving right in front of his throat in an instant. With the spear in front of Sharon\u2019s jaw, the icy spearhead forced Sharlon to swallow his words. Sharon instantly turned pale as he became drenched in sweat and stood still as if he was fixed in place, daring not to make even the slightest movement.Nobody from Glaze\u2019s group would have imagined that Zhang Tie could move so fast. Just now, Zhang Tie was just standing with the spear in hand; however, in the blink of an eye, much like a magic trick, the spear that had been in Zhang Tie\u2019s hand slid forward, stopped, and was raised. Those three motions were done fluidly like water. Before they had even been able to respond, Zhang Tie\u2019s spear had already appeared before Sharon\u2019s chin. Zhang Tie\u2019s actions were was too fast\u2014it was fast, fierce, and accurate! In an instant, he had frightened all four of them. The moment Zhang Tie shot out his spear, a cold and fierce aura surged around him, and even the other three could feel it. At that moment, they felt as if the aura of the spear had completely pierced through Sharon\u2019s neck, causing them to feel a chill on their backs. \u201cHow is this guy so vicious? We didn\u2019t notice this back at school!\u201dThe other three immediately turned pale. Just as Glaze was about to pull out the weapon on his waist, Zhang Tie\u2019s spear, once again, retracted all of a sudden as if nothing had happened. Zhang Tie, like before, once again went on his way, rudely colliding into Sharon as he pushed him away and left with big strides.Seven or eight steps away, while Zhang Tie was recalling the casual feeling he had when he shot out his spear, he heard the quick steps of Glaze\u2019s group chasing behind him. His auditory sense had become greatly sensitive since his spiritual energy suddenly surged. Zhang Tie cursed inside and was determined to give them a lesson. He had once been told by Donder that for these kinds of bastards, you must beat them up fiercely when you have the opportunity!\u201cBastards\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie turned around as he gave a thunder-like roar. His roar had frightened Glaze\u2019s group, who were about to catch up to him. Even the attention of the many people in the square had been attracted at this moment, causing them to turn to their direction. In a split second, everybody in the square, including both the male students and the female students, all turned and stared at them, resulting in the entire square becoming quiet. Earlier when Glaze\u2019s group had blocked Zhang Tie at the gate of the castle, they had already attracted some people\u2019s attention; however, now, because of Zhang Tie\u2019s voice, everyone\u2019s attention was attracted.\u201cDo not follow me anymore, and stay away from me. I like women, not men! Even if you take off your trousers and kneel in front of me, I will still not be interested in your disgusting butts. I\u2019ll say it again, I like women\u2026\u201d Continuing, Zhang Tie exclaimed furiously, \u201cIn order to get rid of you, instead of hunting, I have decided to be a miner. Yet, you guys are still trying to give me trouble? You guys want to use that stinky bit of meat in your hands to lure me? I will tell you again\u2014I am a man and I like women! I am not interested in your filthy game where you pretend to be men in public but become eunuchs in private. Stay away from me with that wolf hide that you use in your filthy game. If you keep following me shamelessly, don\u2019t blame me for using my spear to destroy your anus, letting your wish be fulfilled!\u201dZhang Tie\u2019s words were fast and sharp, but the information it contained was too great, too terrifying, and too scandalous! After several seconds, the silent square suddenly burst into an uproar. Hundreds of people, regardless of whether they were male or female, released their gossipy souls and immediately surrounded them as they began to stare at Zhang Tie, then the faces of Glaze\u2019s group, then the sheep carried by Garner and Zuhair, and finally the wolf hide used in their filthy game that was carried by Sharon. It was obvious that these four guys were chasing after the guy who was about to go to the mines. Looking at the wolf hides, some guys in the crowd had even thought of something and started to vomit as they bent over.Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, Glaze\u2019s group felt blood rushing to their heads. They were at a loss for words\u2026\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 bastard! Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d Zuhair furiously pointed at Zhang Tie. Under the weird look in the eyes of the people around them, Zuhair became upset and could only weakly refute.At the same time, the crowd started to murmur to each other.\u201cYes, I am a bastard. If you don\u2019t follow me anymore, then you can call me whatever you want\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh towards the sky. \u201cYou just can\u2019t force me to do that. Zuhair, I like women\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie pointed at the female students surrounding them. \u201cI like to be surrounded by women that are like water fairies with big breasts and plump butts. Ah, they are my babies. What I desire the most is for innocent love between my favorite girl and me. If you promise to me in the public that you will no longer follow me, then I will definitely explain to everyone that what I had just said was nonsense. Then, you can just go and continue doing whatever you want on the wolf hide\u2026\u201dFrom his surroundings came another sound of vomiting. The gaze of many fell onto the wolf hide held by Sharon. In a split second, instead of wolf hides, Sharon felt like as if he was holding a hot sheet of iron. Especially when he saw the frightened look in the eyes of the girls that surrounded them as they covered their mouths in horror, Sharon trembled all over. It\u2019s all over! We can\u2019t even dream of having beauties anymore!\u201cYou disgusting bastards! He has already been driven to the point of mining by you! Why are you still here? Piss off right now! Don\u2019t dirty Wild Wolf Castle\u2026\u201d someone in the crowd started to curse at them loudly. Afterwards, Glaze\u2019s group was immediately buried by curses.\u201cYea, they are too shameless! How could they be this shameless!?\u201d\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? Some male students in their youth would be very depressed. If they are poorly self-disciplined, they might even do something strange!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too disgusting\u2026 Once I see those wolf hides, I can\u2019t help but want to vomit!\u201d\u201cI have both heard and seen what happened. Just then, when this student was getting ready to mine and leave the castle, right when he left the gate, these students, who were in ambush, had blocked him. They had even tried to make him succumb to them by using the meat, but the student who was preparing to go mining just ignored them. After pushing away that guy with wolf hide in his hand, he wanted to leave. Unexpectedly, they caught up with him\u2026\u201d another voice rose up from among the crowd, explaining what had happened just now.\u201cI can also testify! These four bastards are from our Seventh National Male Middle School! Everybody in Seventh National Male Middle School could tell you that after these guys\u2019 bodies started to develop, they formed a small group that did not get along with the others. Every noon, they would go for lunch together, never leaving a single one behind. Normal male students would never do that. In the past, I had always been curious about this, but now I finally understand\u2026\u201d The explanation was so timely that Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but raise his thumb in his mind. This guy was truly good at using words, especially when he said \u201cbodies developed\u201d, \u201ctogether\u201d, and \u201ca small group that did not get along with the others\u201d. Those words were truly great\u2014too realistic and really lets people\u2019s imagination go wild!\u201cRight, right, right. It was just like that. I am also from Seventh National Male Middle School. I can also testify\u2026\u201dAll the surrounding horny students from Seventh National Male Middle School became spirited. They started to attack Glaze\u2019s group like beating mice in the street, wanting to completely destroy the reputation of Glaze\u2019s group.It was too despicable, too shameless, too disgusting! This was the largest scandal of this year\u2019s survival training. Among the crowd, some of the guys who had exchanged their meat for wild vegetables and fruits from the girls couldn\u2019t help but throw the wild vegetables and fruits at the heads of the members of Glaze\u2019s group\u2026\u201cPiss off!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cPiss off!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cPiss off!\u201dThere were all sorts of curses thrown towards Glaze\u2019s group. Everybody, including both males and females, was glaring at them, and a look of disgust could be seen in their eyes.Even now, Glaze was still confused about how he had been humiliated so miserably in such a short period of time. Earlier, he was planning to show off in the castle square in order to attract some female students; however, he had unexpectedly met Zhang Tie, so he wanted to give him a lesson by humiliating him horribly. After being hit by two wild fruits on his head and seeing the resentful and regretful look on Zhang Tie, Glaze was completely infuriated and felt the blood all over his body rushing to his head and boiling like magma.With the sound of \u201cXing\u201d, Glaze pulled out the sword from the sheath hanging on his waist, immediately silencing the curses from the people around him. Seeing his actions, everyone in the audience took two steps back.Seeing Glaze\u2019s response, Zuhair\u2019s face became twisted. He wanted to stop Glaze, but he was too late. With eyes turning red, Glaze gazed at Zhang Tie and chopped towards Zhang Tie as he howled, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201dSeeing Glaze\u2019s actions, the surrounding female students were shocked and screamed out loudly\u2026Holding his spear tightly, Zhang Tie took a defensive posture; however, Zhang Tie was not nervous in the least, as he had noticed a certain figure in the crowd just now.Although Glaze moved fast, that figure moved faster. The instant Glaze charged at Zhang Tie, he had already been forced back and was sent flying backwards faster than when he had just charged, crashing onto the ground with a loud \u201cBang!\u201d\u201d. Glaze felt dazed. Before he was able to pick himself up from the ground, he heard an icy voice.\u201cAccording to Andaman Alliance\u2019s wartime decree, anyone who dares to pull out their sword and attack another student in public can, at worst, be punished with the death penalty\u2026\u201d the figure standing in the ring of students said coldly, causing Glaze\u2019s group to immediately turn pale.\u201cTeacher\u2026\u201d Zuhair wanted to explain, but the figure casually raised her hand as she harrumphed, \u201cShut up!\u201d Hearing the teacher\u2019s order, Zuhair became silent. \u201cConsidering that this is your first time making such a mistake, you have not harmed anyone yet, and it was not easy for you to become a LV 2 fighter before the survival training, I will simply give you the punishment of having to stay 10 km away from Wild Wolf Castle for one month. Now, before I change my mind, take your things and immediately get out of here!\u201dAfter saying that, the figure flicked her hand, throwing Glaze\u2019s sword, which she had just grabbed, back into the sheath hanging on Glaze\u2019s waist.Seeing that sword flying towards him, Glaze\u2019s heart almost stopped. At that moment, the only thing that Glaze could imagine was the scene of the colorful leopard that had been nailed into the ground by Captain Kerlin\u2019s spear. It was only when the sword had entered his sheath did his heart began to beat again. His back had already been drenched with cold sweat. Having realized that what he had done was truly reckless, Glaze did not dare to say anything and only gave Zhang Tie a vicious glare. Saying nothing at all, Glaze left the square of Wild Wolf Castle with his followers under the weird stares and jeers of the audience.Zhang Tie realized that, after this incident, he and Glaze could be considered as eternal enemies; however, he wasn\u2019t afraid, the god of time was standing on his side \u2026Some of the female students in the crowd started to show their courtesy to that figure who had helped Zhang Tie.\u201cMiss Qili\u2026\u201dThe audience also started to leave. Zhang Tie also wanted to slip away at this moment; however, unfortunately for him, the basket on his back was truly too conspicuous. The moment he moved, he was noticed by others.\u201cAs for you\u2026\u201d Hearing her words, Zhang Tie immediately became still. Turning around, he forced an innocent smile, but unfortunately, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t receive a warm response; instead, slight traces of disgust could be seen in the eyes of Miss Qili. It was as if that woman was staring at a toad who was drooling uncontrollably. \u201cYou are also a shameless rascal. You are not a good student either. In the following period of the survival training, if you dare to stay alone with any female student for over three minutes, I will chop off your hands!\u201dHearing such a punishment, Zhang Tie became shocked. He could not believe that the boring woman called Qili would force him to be a bachelor in the survival training. What an abnormal punishment! Sh*t\u2026\u2026\u2026Seeing as the crowd had left, Zhang Tie, who was just given a punishment, had also intended to leave the square as he gloomily lowered his head. From this incident, Zhang Tie also suffered a great loss. He didn\u2019t know whether he should cry or laugh.While walking, Zhang Tie\u2019s head suddenly collided with something soft and springy. Raising his head, Zhang Tie saw a beautiful girl who was covering her magnificent breasts with her hands. The instant Zhang Tie saw that pair of breasts, Zhang Tie sighed inside, \u201cWow, they are so big!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt that moment, the girl\u2019s face was as red as her hair. A familiar, beautiful face with willow leaf-like eyebrows looked at him.Before Zhang Tie was able to apologize, the girl had already opened her mouth.\u201cI have plump breasts and butts, so what? Who\u2019s your baby? I know you bastards have long dreamt of sleeping with me. You didn\u2019t forget me at all and always have me in your mind. These past couple of days, you must have thought about doing terrifying and disgusting things to me numerous times. I\u2019m warning you! Do not those disgusting things to me in your mind anymore. Don\u2019t think about me in your mind! You rascal, you deserve to be f*cked by those perverts!\u201d The girl kept talking as if she was shooting bullets from a machine gun that was used before the Catastrophe. After she finished speaking, she kicked Zhang Tie\u2019s leg with her pointy deerskin boots and ran away.\u201cWas she talking to me? She wasn\u2019t talking to me, right?\u201dZhang Tie became speechless for quite a while. He then looked to his right, his left, and behind him, finding nobody else. Finally, thinking about that girl\u2019s unreasonable kick, Zhang Tie felt a sharp pain on his shin and started to shriek miserably. Hugging his leg, he jumped up from the ground.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

What a crazy and lecherous woman! Who the f*ck knows you? Who the f*ck is thinking about you? You\u2019d better stay out of my sight. If I see you again, I\u2019ll tie you up and hmph\u2026 hmph\u2026\u2026\u201dContinuing on his way, he walked like a cripple as he used his spear as a crutch. Every time he thought back to how that woman had cursed him and kicked his shin, he would curse her. Like the male students from the national male middle schools, the female students from the national female middle schools were taught some fighting skills, and thus they were not as weak as normal women; in contrast, they were much more aggressive. Needless to say, those skills were targeted at men. At the very least, from that kick to his shin alone, Zhang Tie already felt that that red-haired woman with plump breasts had very powerful and fast kicks. Given that she had also targeted a cunning and accurate spot to attack, it seemed that she had always been practicing this skill.\u201cFirst, I framed Glaze\u2019s group, then following that I was framed by another person. Is this karma? Will those framing others always be framed?\u201d Zhang Tie started to feel frightened and awe-stricken. In the past, Zhang Tie could almost be considered an atheist, as he held no beliefs; however, ever since he obtained the Castle of Black Iron, his atheist view had gradually begun to collapse. In Zhang Tie\u2019s opinion, both the Manjusaka fruit tree and the space in the Castle of Black Iron had already surpassed the limits that human beings could reach. Besides God, Zhang Tie could not think of another being that could create such things. But, what was a god? Was there truly a god out there that controlled everything, one who spins the wheel of fate?Zhang Tie would never have imagined that the resentment between him and Glaze\u2019s group would reach such a stage. Honestly, when Zhang Tie turned around earlier and cursed at Glaze\u2019s group, he was only planning to make a joke, intending to turn them into laughingstocks, but they had instead been dealt a harsh punishment. Zhang Tie finally realized what Donder\u2019s words meant. \u201cA soft tongue can break hard bones\u201d\u2014language was an invisible, sharp blade that could kill people.After leaving Wild Wolf Castle, Zhang Tie went around the iron mine near the Wild Wolf Castle. Even though it was daytime, he was still not able to see anything a dozen meters ahead of him after entering the cave. As he had no other choice, Zhang Tie turned back, realizing that he needed a torch to mine within.After having been ferociously kicked by that damned woman, Zhang Tie\u2019s shin became swollen, thus he couldn\u2019t freely move. As he didn\u2019t have any lighting tools, Zhang Tie decided to turn back. Walking around the pine trees in Wild Wolf Valley, Zhang Tie was hoping to find wood that could be used as a torch and pine resin. As he knew it might be dangerous in the forest, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t dare to venture too deep alone.The wood that could be ignited easily were the ones by the trunk that had been soaked in a great amount of pine resin that was secreted from the trees. Compared to the other parts of the pine tree, the wood of the trunk was much easier to burn. Once it had been chopped off the tree, one could, without even drying it, ignite the wood. The wood could burn for a long time because the fire would not be able to be easily extinguished. Having been immersed in pine resin, they were the best natural torch in the wild.As there were many wild pine trees in Wild Wolf Valley, one would be able to see many pine trees with diameters greater than 3 m everywhere. Arriving at the forest of pine trees, Zhang Tie saw many people, both male and female, at the edge of the forest. There were many treasures in the forest of pine trees. For example, pine resin had multiple purposes, pine cones could be consumed, and there were even many delicious foods, like wild vegetables and mushrooms that grew quickly during the rainy season between May and August, that could be found on the ground beside the rotting pine needles. Pine needles were even edible if they were fresh and had been placed in boiling water for a while. Even the wood from the pine trees of Wild Wolf Valley could meet many of the people\u2019s basic needs.While the female students collected pine resin, pine cones, wild vegetables, and mushrooms in the forest, the male students were doing laborious work. Especially when noticed by the girls, they would work even harder as they madly chopped the pine trees, as the wood from the trees were great firewood for making coal.\u201cBrother, can you do me a favor?\u201dCatching sight of Zhang Tie wandering the forest with an eye-catching basket on his back, a male student who was chopping wood stopped him.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Zhang Tie moved over in a manner akin to a cripple.\u201cBrother, are you here to look for a torch to bring with you to the mines?\u201dZhang Tie was amazed at that guy\u2019s good observation skills as he nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s great. This pine tree should have a lot of wood that could be easily ignited. Help me out and we\u2019ll chop this tree together, then we can cut it into three sections. You can take all the easily ignited wood, the pine resin, and half the pine cones. How about it?\u201dGlancing over at the pine tree that was as broad as a person\u2019s waist, Zhang Tie saw the flowing pine resin and the many places on the body of the tree covered with a thick layer of pine resin. He estimated that the amount of wood that could be used as firewood inside was not little. Even if he couldn\u2019t find any firewood, Zhang Tie would still be able to make a few torches since there was so much pine resin on it.\u201cFine!\u201d Zhang Tie immediately put down his basket and took turns with the other male student to chop down the tree. After chopping the tree for a while, Wood directly passed his axe to Zhang Tie, letting him continue with his axe, and threw himself to the ground, resting to the side as he idly chatted with Zhang Tie.\u201cI\u2019m Wood, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Zhang Tie. Are you from the Second National Male Middle School?\u201d\u201cYea. What\u2019s wrong with your leg?\u201d\u201cI was kicked by a mad woman!\u201d Zhang Tie gloomily answered as he continued to brandish his axe.\u201cHaha, brother, you can\u2019t use force against women. My mom once told me that men need to pretend to be gentlemen in front of women. Even though you can\u2019t wait and want to throw them onto the bed, you definitely can\u2019t show it; instead, you must coax them. When you want to sleep with them, you have to ask whether they\u2019d like to take a rest\u2026\u201d Wood laughed out loudly as he pointed at Zhang Tie\u2019s basket. \u201cAlso, if you want to attract women, you shouldn\u2019t be mining. No woman wants their man to be a miner!\u201d\u201cThis guy is really interesting,\u201d Zhang Tie said inside; however, he immediately retorted, \u201cDoes that mean they prefer their husband to be a charcoal maker?\u201d\u201cIt was my fiance who told me to make coal here. She didn\u2019t want me to attract too much attention and wanted me to pay attention to my own safety. Thinking over it, making charcoal was the best option\u2026\u201d Wood replied proudly.\u201cYou already have a wife?\u201d Zhang Tie stared at Wood in amazement.\u201cOf course, we grew up together in a courtyard since we were young. Two years ago, when we played outside, I asked whether she would take a rest, then I made her my wife. She\u2019s in another school. After this survival training, we will be engaged! Brother, you need to learn from me on this aspect\u2026\u201dWood\u2019s words struck Zhang Tie once again. Zhang Tie realized that his relationship with the female students has been poor recently. Ever since he left school, he could not see Miss Daina anymore. When he was going to sleep with Miss Anna, he found out he needed to be circumcised. On the third day since the start of the survival training, he was forbidden by that damned Qili to stay with girls for more than three minutes. Afterwards, he was even fiercely kicked by an insane girl. Damn it! Being compared to Wood, he was really envious. That foolish looking guy had already gotten to enjoy the taste of a woman at least two years ago; in contrast, he had not even touched a girl\u2019s hand.Feeling as if he had taken a blow, Zhang Tie became speechless. He just lowered his head and kept brandishing the axe, seriously treating the pine tree as an enemy. Zhang Tie\u2019s good strength really startled Wood. Finally, under Zhang Tie\u2019s persistent efforts during the past ten more minutes of brandishing the axe at a high frequency, the pine tree slowly inclined as it fell to the ground accompanied by the sounds of cracking.The falling of the pine tree attracted the attention of the three nearby girls who were carrying baskets, causing them to come over. Among the three that came over, one was a blonde beauty, while the other two were more beautiful than the average girl; they were all beautiful girls who were pleasing to the eye.\u201cHello, can you gift us with the pine cones from the tree?\u201d The girl speaking was definitely a beauty; she had blonde hair and a slim frame, her face was a snow-white that was akin to milk, her voice was as fair sounding as that of a yellow warbler[1], her smile was as warm as the sunshine, and her attitude was perfectly sincere.At the sight of such a perfect beauty, Wood\u2019s face blushed. He then raised his chest and said generously, \u201cNo problem! However, half of pine cones on this tree belong to him. If you want the other half, you have to gain his approval!\u201d Saying this, Wood pointed to his side at Zhang Tie, who was panting as he held onto the handle of the axe.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe blonde-haired beauty kept smiling as she moved her eyes onto Zhang Tie. Zhang Tie, who was extremely dejected at that moment, glanced at her. Recalling the abnormal punishment he had received, he finally lost his temper. \u201cBeauty? To me, a beauty is as useful as a fart right now. I can\u2019t eat nor can I touch them. They might even lose their temper and kick me!\u201d Zhang Tie thought inside.Zhang Tie then immediately refuted her, \u201cNo way, I will take away all of my pine cones. I won\u2019t give you even one!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the sunshine-like smile on that blonde-haired beauty immediately froze. Her face then became cold as if it were covered in frost, and the other girls beside her stared at Zhang Tie with mouths agape. Such a rude guy! Such a rough guy! This was their first time encountering such a person. Even Wood was staring at Zhang Tie in amazement. He started to doubt whether Zhang Tie had felt stimulation before. Afterwards, without caring about the people staring at him, Zhang Tie directly lowered his mining basket and ran over to pick up the pine cones.Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s movements, the other girls looked at each other before they also ran over to pick pine cones as fast as possible\u2026[1] Type of bird.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was also the first to act. In contrast, the three girls were weaker and were slower to act. As the difficulty of picking pine cones was higher than peaches, they were on even grounds. There were at least 70-80 pine cones on the tree. Not intending to show even the slightest bit of courtesy, Zhang Tie\u2019s two hands, which were as nimble as a monkey\u2019s, grabbed the bigger ones. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s attitude, the girls, one by one, began to grit their teeth. Although the pine cones they got were smaller, what irritated them more was this annoying guy, who ignored their charm, as he grabbed the pine cones in front of them, treating it as a big deal.Seeing the two parties moving faster and faster and becoming increasingly more ferocious, Wood, who stood to the side, touched his head and became really speechless. It seems that he finally knew why Zhang Tie had been kicked by that girl. He was not like a gentleman in the least when in front of girls\u2014he completely deserved it!After a short while, under their collective efforts, all the pine cones on the tree, with the exception of the last, medium-sized pine cone that hung on a twig, were picked off. At the same time, Zhang Tie and that blonde-haired girl both stretched out their hand, intending to grab it. The instant the girl\u2019s finger touched the pine cone, it suddenly disappeared right in front of her eyes; Zhang Tie had directly broken the twig, snatching the pine cone away.Watching Zhang Tie slowly remove the twig from the pine cone and casually throwing it into the ugly mining basket on his back, all three girls stood up and glared at the ruthless guy, Zhang Tie, who lacked any traces of being a gentleman.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d The blonde-haired beauty glared at Zhang Tie. \u201cIf you offend us, you will be the enemy of us, the Rose Association!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Zhang Tie\u2026\u201d Seeing the angered look on the three girls, not knowing why, Zhang Tie felt the discomfort in his heart disappear and arrived a certain conclusion\u2014if one was not feeling well, one could transfer their discomfort onto others, and thus immediately allowing the self to feel better.\u201cGood, I\u2019ve remembered you!\u201d After she finished speaking, the blonde-haired girl wanted to leave.\u201cYou better not miss me\u2026\u201d Noticing that they were leaving, Zhang Tie hurriedly shouted.\u201cHmph\u2026 Hmph\u2026\u201d A girl with freckles on her face raised her chin and gave a proud smile. \u201cYou rude guy, it\u2019s already too late for you to apologize to us. We from the Rose association are not that easily bullied!\u201d\u201cNo, I think you misunderstood. My meaning was you better not miss me, and especially do not dream of doing those disgusting and terrifying things to me in your dreams when you miss me!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the girls gaped as their faces turned pale. After glaring at Zhang Tie and calling him a bastard, they turned around and immediately left\u2026Zhang Tie realized that his heart finally felt refreshed. This depression transfer method was really useful.At this time, Wood, who was standing by the side, raised his thumb towards Zhang Tie. \u201cBrother, I think I understand now\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat have you understood?\u201d Zhang Tie curiously asked.\u201cMy mom had told me that what men were afraid of the most was being unable to leave an impression in the mind of the woman they liked. For a man to succeed, if they could not cause the woman to fall in love with them at first sight, then the best alternative was to make that woman hate them during the first encounter. A woman\u2019s heart is very miraculous. Even though they might hate you at first, they might very well fall in love with you later. Weren\u2019t you using this method?\u201d Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s shocked expression, before Zhang Tie was even able to open his mouth, Wood hurriedly stopped him and patted his shoulder. \u201cNo need to deny it. We are both men. I understand!\u201d\u2026\u2026Afterwards, working together with Wood for another two hours, they were finally able to divide the pine tree into three sections. Zhang Tie obtained more than 250g of pine resin and more than 10 kg of firewood, which were enough to make five or six torches. Zhang Tie put them into his awkward mining basket and left the forest of pine trees.\u2026\u2026While Zhang Tie was busy chopping the pine tree, Glaze\u2019 group had stealthily slid back to their base. Since Glaze felt that he was stronger than the others and wanted to show off, the four of them had set base at a location that was 10 km away from Wild Wolf Castle. The four had set base in a natural mountain cave on a cliff that was 6 m above the ground. In order to enter the cave, they would have to climb down a vine of the tree above the cliff. Although it was far from Wild Wolf Castle, they would not be threatened by common beasts here. This could be considered a decent location.The atmosphere in the mountain cave was depressing. It was dead silent. This time, Glaze did not lose his temper nor did he shout loudly; instead, he calmed down expressionlessly. However, the more silent Glaze was, the more the other three felt uneasy.After being silent for a long time, Glaze finally opened his mouth, \u201cZuhair, if I stealthily enter Zhang Tie\u2019s base and chop off his head, do you think there\u2019ll be a problem?\u201dHearing Glaze\u2019s question, the other three quivered at the same time as they felt a terrifying and cruel air from Glaze\u2019s calm tone.\u201cSince the conflict between him and us have been made public today, everyone knows that you want to kill him. So, if you kill him during the survival training, you would be the first to be suspected and would definitely be investigated by the Temporary Inspection Committee. The four leading teachers in the Temporary Inspection Committee are all great and fierce. I also don\u2019t know what means they would use to investigate you. If you go kill him, it would be difficult to ensure that you haven\u2019t left any evidence!\u201d Zuhair forcefully swallowed his saliva and glanced at Glaze as he chose his words carefully. \u201cToday\u2019s conflict was completely out of our expectation. If things went according to our original plan this afternoon, then he would be suffering for the next couple of days. We only need to slightly adjust our original plan, and we would be able to kill him. These past few days, we have already found a wolf den. Luckily, Zhang Tie chose to be a miner alone. Not only is Zhang Tie looking for his own death, but the Gods have even gifted us such an opportunity. He\u2019s definitely dead this time. For the next couple of days, I will stealthily follow him and grasp his habits. Afterwards, we can carry out our plans against him!\u201d\u201cThat Burwick should also die. Anyone who blocks my path ahead should die!\u201d Glaze ferociously said.\u201cThat Burwick is more cunning than Zhang Tie. Ever since we arrived at Wild Wolf Valley, he has already made precautions against our revenge. Right now, he has a certain degree of influence and has more than 200 people on his side. These past few days, they have been practicing how to hunt prey. At any time and any place, there would be a large number of people around him, making it hard for us to find an opportunity to kill him. If we really want to deal with him, we will have to think of another way. According to the usual arrangement of survival training in the past years, there would be a competition between students from different schools. If Burwick wants to stand out in the final competition, he has to get a good rank. When the time comes, you just need to find an opportunity to pretend to make a mistake and heavily wound or kill him, but\u2026\u201d Zuhair stopped talking\u2026\u201cBut what?\u201d\u201cBurwick is already a LV 1 fighter, and he\u2019s not much weaker than you. He is also cunning and good at hiding his real strength. If you fight him in the ring, he might find a way to escape.\u201d\u201cNot much weaker than me?\u201d The corner of Glaze\u2019s mouth raised into a cold smile. Glancing over the three in the cave, Glaze asked, \u201cDo you think only others will improve or hide their strength, and I will stay a LV 2 fighter forever?\u201d\u201cGlaze, you\u2026\u201d Sharon showed a face of surprise\u2026\u201cAt most, it will take me two weeks to ignite the second burning point on my spine. Once I do that, I will become a LV 3 fighter\u2026\u201d Glaze\u2019s eyes seemed to shine with ghost fire. \u201cIn the final competition, I will definitely find an opportunity to kill Burwick. The moment I start to control my own fate, you will also start to control your own fates with my favor\u2026\u201dThey no longer talked about Zhang Tie. Previously, when Zhang Tie went against them at school, Zuhair had already thought up of a fierce plan to take revenge on Zhang Tie during the survival training. After today\u2019s incident, they were more determined to take revenge on Zhang Tie. A few of them didn\u2019t even think Zhang Tie would be able to defend against their revenge. In their eyes, Zhang Tie was just a rude and brainless, trivial figure who dared to go against them and sought his own death, while Burwick was the one who could really threaten Glaze\u2019s position at school. At school, there were even rumors that some teachers thought that Burwick was better than Glaze. Once Burwick found an opportunity to stand out in the survival training, he would be able to obtain a recommendation. Certainly, Glaze would not allow for such a thing to happen.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026When Zhang Tie with his awkward mining basket finally returned to the trap that he had set in the hidden stream, it was already afternoon. The afterglow from the setting sun started to scatter off Wild Wolf Valley. Seeing that none of the traps he had set in the forest were able to catch prey, Zhang Tie was slightly disappointed.On his way back, Zhang Tie had paid attention to whether he had been followed by the others or not. During this time, he pretended to be wandering about in the forest. Seeing that nobody was following him, he stealthily slid to that stream.When he arrived at one side of the stream, Zhang Tie was still somewhat nervous. After all, this was his first attempt. He was not sure that he could capture fish.After taking a deep breath, Zhang Tie moved away the twigs that sat above the pond. The scene in front of him immediately surprised him. There were eight fish joyfully swimming in the pond, five of which were grass carps. The other three were much longer than a chopstick, and each weighed at least 2 kg. On their jet black backs, one could see two pale golden lines. Seeing all of this, Zhang Tie became really excited\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As Leit was on duty for the second half of the night, he was tired and was currently resting under the tree.Once Zhang Tie saw the listless faces of Doug and Sharwin, he realized that the five must have obtained nothing at all. For several green birds who lacked experience, catching prey for the first time was pretty unlikely.Sitting under that Dragon-Claw Tree, they turned around and saw Zhang Tie\u2019s ugly mining basket.\u201cYou\u2019re really going to be a miner?\u201d Barley asked.\u201cOf course, look at my equipment. Oh, I encountered Glaze\u2019s group near Wild Wolf Castle today!\u201d Zhang Tie said.Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the rest became nervous.\u201cDid they give you trouble?\u201d Leit asked.\u201cThey dare to push around our brother? Let\u2019s go and find them to settle the score right now!\u201d Doug directly picked himself up from the ground, intending to go get his weapon.Zhang Tie hurriedly pressed down on Doug\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThey didn\u2019t bully me. Actually, it was me who bullied them a bit!\u201d\u201cYou bullied them!?\u201d Barley cried out. \u201cDid you wound them?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d\u201cThen what happened?\u201dAt their request, Zhang Tie told them what had happened between him and Glaze\u2019s group in the square. Hearing that Glaze\u2019s group were chased out of the square as people threw wild vegetables and fruits at them, all the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood laughed out loudly as they rolled here and there on the ground.Hista had even laughed so hard he began to tear up. \u201cHaha! That\u2019s too marvelous, truly too marvelous! I really want to see their expressions at that moment!\u201d\u201cFor several men to use wolf hides to make love, that\u2019s too disgusting, too dirty! But, I like it. Hahaha\u2026\u201d Bagdad slapped his thigh.\u201cBighead, I really haven\u2019t seen though you. Usually, you look very innocent. I would never have imagined that you would do something like this. This move of yours is truly vicious! I\u2019m afraid Glaze\u2019s group wouldn\u2019t be able to find any girls who would be willing to partner with them for this survival training. Haha! I\u2019ve decided. In the future, if I get into a similar incident, I will use the same trick to deal with those annoying guys! This trick is cooler than slapping their face, and also lets me vent a little!\u201d Hista obscenely smiled, causing both his eyes and his mouth to turn into arcs.The group of brothers laughed for a long time before they, one by one, stopped smiling and got down to business.\u201cTake care of yourself. After this incident, I\u2019m afraid Glaze\u2019s group might take revenge on you more fiercely!\u201d Seeing Zhang Tie, Barley seriously said. \u201cPerhaps for you to be working in the mines over there is a good choice. The mines over there are not too far away from Wild Wolf Castle, and there are always people going and coming over there. Glaze\u2019s group of four wouldn\u2019t dare to recklessly look for you to give you trouble. However, whenever you are alone in the wild, they might try to plot against you. That Zuhair guy is definitely a poison snake who can come up with many vicious tricks!\u201dZhang Tie casually shrugged his shoulders. \u201cForget them. Even if today\u2019s incident didn\u2019t happen, their group of four wouldn\u2019t have let me off anyways. Let\u2019s talk about something else. How were your harvests today?\u201dThe ones who went hunting today all spread their hands with the palm side up. \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. We saw some preys, but before we even caught up to them, they had already escaped\u2026\u201d Sharwin helplessly said.\u201cAnd those wild wolves\u2026 They are too cunning. It won\u2019t be easy at all for us to catch them. Trying to capture a boar, Bagdad almost fell into a ravine\u2026\u201d\u201cThere were too many people hunting over there, so many of the prey were already scared away!\u201d\u201cBringing the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d over there is also a good option, but it\u2019s too heavy. If we bring it with us, it\u2019ll affect our movement. This weapon can only be used at a fixed location!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Today, we met a guy who was very powerful and brought with him a bow. In just an afternoon, he was able to hunt two wild deer. From his looks, he shouldn\u2019t be weaker than Glaze!\u201dHearing their words, Zhang Tie could already imagine what they had experienced this afternoon. It was really miserable for them.\u201cOh right, how was your harvest today?\u201d Barley asked Zhang Tie as he stared at the mining basket with a slight frown. \u201cIs there something inside?\u201dHearing Barley\u2019s words, Zhang Tie patted his head, realizing that he had forgotten that he had not yet put down his mining basket and took out the goods from within.\u201cI almost forgot. Tonight, I will invite all of you to drink fish soup!\u201d Zhang Tie generously smiled\u2026Hearing the word \u201cfish\u201d, everybody\u2019s eyes began to shine. Even in Blackhot City, fish was very expensive, and they could only eat it a couple of times a year, let alone here.\u201cAlthough you caught a fish, I\u2019m afraid it might not be enough for the seven of us\u2026\u201d As he spoke to this point, his eyes almost popped out because Zhang Tie had put down the mining basket and removed everything inside, revealing three big fish wrapped in water weeds. Although more than twenty minutes had already passed since they were put in the mining basket, they were still alive. The moment they were placed on the ground, two of the fish were taking deep breaths as they flopped on the ground, while the other fish jumped once. Besides Barley, the other horny animals also stared with wide opened eyes, as they realized that the three fish together weighed at least 7-8 kg, which was enough for everyone to eat.\u201cGrab them. We\u2019ll clean them in the stream over there. After we remove their scales and innards, we can boil them in the pot\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie hurriedly grabbed the most lively fish, while the other two fish were consecutively grabbed by the other two drooling, horny animals.Barley had also grabbed one of the fish. When he saw the golden line on the back of the fish, he exclaimed, \u201cNo way! It\u2019s a golden threadfin bream!\u201d\u201cYou know this fish? We can\u2019t eat it?\u201d Zhang Tie became worried. If these fish couldn\u2019t be consumed by humans, he would be mocked and called a big head by the others.\u201cHaha! This is the best freshwater fish we can enjoy in Blackhot City. Brothers, we will have a luxurious supper tonight\u2026\u201d Barley laughed out loudly.Hearing Barley\u2019s words, everybody cheered up. After realizing that they would have fish to eat tonight, the depressed guys immediately became spirited. Just for a few fish, they began to delicately distribute the work that needed to be done. Some boiled water, others added firewood to the fire, while the others killed the fish. All in a sudden, the tree base was brimming with joy. While cleaning the fish in the stream, Doug made a mistake and let the fish slip out of his hand. The moment the fish into the water, it had tried to swim away. Thankfully, the stream was neither wide nor deep; it was only about 20-30 cm in depth. After the collective, hasty efforts of a few people, they were finally able to capture that fish. Although most of their clothes had been soaked, they all still felt very happy.\u201cDon\u2019t throw away the innards. Cover them with tree leaves and leave them to me. I will use them!\u201d Seeing that Leit was about to throw them away, Zhang Tie hurriedly stopped him and grabbed some large tree leaves to wrap the innards of the fish.\u201cThis stuff can\u2019t be eaten. Why do you want to leave them?\u201d Doug curiously asked.\u201cWe can\u2019t eat them, but that doesn\u2019t mean other animals can\u2019t!\u201d Zhang Tie showed a mysterious smile\u2026\u2026\u2026After being cleaned, the golden threadfin breams were cut into pieces and placed into the pot with boiling water. Sharwin fetched a hand full of wild pepper and sprayed them inside along with a bit salt. Soon after, when the water in the pot was boiling again, the aroma of fish soup drifted out from the pot, causing everyone to drool. The color of the fish soup had turned into a milky color. When the others saw it, their appetite greatly increased, and they all forcefully swallowed their saliva.Everyone greatly enjoyed this supper. Every one of them hated for it to end as they all licked their bowls clean. Three fish were used to cook the pot of soup, and in the end, not a single drop of soup or a single piece of fish was left. That golden threadfin bream was truly delicious. With the exception of Barley, this was the first time the others had eaten something this delicious.After eating to their fill, everyone sat around the campfire and chatted. To sate their curiosity, Zhang Tie told them everything about trapping the fish, including the principle behind it and the location. Hearing that Zhang Tie could easily capture fish with such a method, every member\u2019s mouth gaped.As he moved the firewood under the huge pot to improve the roasting of the pine cones, he imparted to the others his method of trapping fish. He had buried those pine cones under the ash from the firewood. Once firm pine cones were heated, they would expand and thus expose the pine nuts inside. Zhang Tie picked a well-roasted pine cone and threw it to Doug. Drooling, Doug opened the pine cone and started to chew on the pine nut as he mumbled:Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBighead, so to say, does this mean that even if you don\u2019t do anything, you would still be able to easily get 1 kg of food every day?\u201d\u201cHaha, if I get less than 1 kg of fish a day, then it will belong to me, but if I get more than 1 kg of fish a day, then I will share the rest with you guys. It isn\u2019t just me who has enough food, but everyone!\u201d Zhang Tie explained as he smiled. \u201cActually, I think we should still think over it. There are still many kinds of hunting methods. For example, Glaze has a powerful fighting force, so he directly catches his prey. There\u2019s also that bowman that you guys saw. He\u2019s extraordinary at archery, so he uses his bow to shoot his prey. Then there\u2019s Burwick. I heard that there are many people around him, so he takes advantage of their large numbers to catch prey. We can definitely learn from them. If we want to gather food and catch prey, then we have to use our strengths. None of us brothers could match Glaze when it comes to fighting strength, and neither could we match the number of people by Burwick\u2019s side. Since we are new here, we need to take some time to adapt to the environment and accumulate experience. I think we can take advantage of the time the others are using to adapt to the environment to try out some special methods!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, everybody\u2019s eyes began to shine.\u201cWhat do you think is the best method for us to use to hunt prey?\u201d Leit asked.\u201cOthers are using archery, their fighting strength, and the advantage in numbers. How about we try laying traps?\u201d Zhang Tie suggested\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Education was designed for the interests and demands of the rulers. Since the rulers of Blackhot City required the schools to raise soldiers, farmers, and workers to support the operation of the city, most of the courses at school reflected this; they were related to and taught the basics required for those jobs, thus the students would never have the opportunity to learn to create traps that could capture low-level beasts.Even in the eyes of many teachers, creating and setting traps was not a skill that was necessary to be imparted at school, as the beasts that could be trapped were just worthless, low-level beasts like tigers and wolves. People above LV 5 could already easily deal with those low-level beasts, even to the point of just tearing them by hand. Therefore, there was no need to set traps at all. If they had free time, it would be better spent in practicing cultivation, striving to ignite as many burning points in their body as possible. Not to mention that hunting was not a skill that was of importance in the eyes of the rulers of Blackhot City. In this age, personal fighting strength was king, while the other skills were not worth mentioning.As a result of their education, almost no student in Blackhot City, perhaps even in the Andaman Alliance, placed much importance to it. In fact, most of them knew nothing about traps. From Zhang Tie\u2019s memories, throughout his entire time at school, it seemed that it was only in last year\u2019s survival class did the teacher casually mention that it was sometimes effective to set traps in the wild; however, this was something that few students would pay attention to.Using traps was something used by those low-level pioneers who explored the wild. Naturally, they would not catch too many people\u2019s eyes. Had Zhang Tie not worked at the grocery store, he too would not have learned about traps. Coming to Wild Wolf Valley this time, Zhang Tie realized that he could really put the traps to use here\u2026If he had not caught those golden threadfin breams earlier, Zhang Tie wouldn\u2019t have the confidence to encourage the others to set traps. Those golden threadfin breams made Zhang Tie realize that the knowledge imparted unto him by Donder was rather valuable, at the very least during this survival training. Although they could learn a lot from the education provided in Blackhot City, they could learn much more from outside the high walls of Blackhot City.In the eyes of the other members of the brotherhood, who had never learned about trapping skills, trapping was a difficult and mysterious skill that would only be used in boring knight novels, where they were all brimming with killing tricks that would frighten people and cause them to be muddleheaded. However, in the end, knight novels were completely fabricated by guys with too much time. After hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s explanation, everybody understood. In fact, everybody could grasp a powerful trapping skill\u2014\u2014digging a hole! A 5 m deep pit was already able to trap most of the fierce beasts and common animals in Wild Wolf Valley. If any beast falls into the pits, they would become live targets for the brotherhood, as any member of the brotherhood could just use the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d that Barley had brought to shoot it to death.\u2026\u2026As usual, Zhang Tie woke up a bit later than 6:00 am the next morning. The entire Wild Wolf Valley was still fast asleep, with the exception of a couple chirping birds and insects. Sharwin was still on duty. Zhang Tie climbed off the tree and walked to the stream to wash his face and rinse his mouth. Afterwards, Zhang Tie replaced Sharwin, letting him go sleep. Sitting by the tree hollow, he took the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d and waited for the other members to wake up.It was the fourth day since they had arrived here. Zhang Tie carefully stared at the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d. Compared to the various portable bows that were created by the people before the Catastrophe, \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d was much more powerful. Zhang Tie had learned that the era before the catastrophe was a time when people used weapons with gunpowder and had too many powerful weapons to choose from, thus they did not pay much attention to the development of weapons that did not utilize gunpowder. However, in this age when weapons that did not use gunpowder became prominent in wars, development that once had nothing to do with weapons with no gunpowder were applied to them, resulting in them gradually becoming extremely powerful.Using a light, complex pulley-based bow as an example, when compared to the traditional manual bows, the largest advantage it had was the hydraulic sliding rod, which was used to pull the string back into the proper position. Although it was similar to a jack[1], it was much more complex than it. Using this hydraulic device, a commoner would be able to pull the string back, putting it at the position for launching the arrow; in contrast, without the device, a strong person would have to use more than 200 kg of force to do the same thing. The addition of the hydraulic device and the standard arrow container, which was developed based on the cartridge holder used in gunpowder-driven weapons before the Catastrophe, caused this bow to be about 30 kg, making it much heavier than common machine bows; however, this increase in weight also meant that it was more powerful. Theoretically, if the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d was in the hands of someone with great strength, he could possibly shoot well over 120 arrows a minute.In contrast, people like Zhang Tie and the other members of Hit-Plane Brotherhood could only shoot out at most ten arrows a minute using this bow. In the previous two nights, although he had adjusted the tension to be \u215b of the original, Sharwin still needed to pull the hydraulic sliding rod eight times for it to succeed. And even Bagdad felt pain in his hand after two attempts when he had adjusted the tension to \u2155 of the maximum. This morning, Zhang Tie had stealthily adjusted the tension to \u2155 of the maximum, and like Bagdad, he only succeeded after two attempts with his left arm and hand feeling pain after.After two attempts of using the \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d, Zhang Tie confirmed two things. First, his strength was almost equivalent to the dark-skinned Bagdad. Second, The Iron Gate series of bow were amazing killing machines. As this bow was just a light one, Zhang Tie found it difficult to imagine the strength of a heavy bow of the same series.Before the other members woke up, Zhang Tie played with the bow, trying to get used to it as he practiced <mental>by visualizing an abacus. Ever since Zhang Tie could visualize an abacus that was capable of doing seven digit calculations, he began to practice visualizing one for eight digits. Recently, whenever he had free time, he would practice eight digit calculation. If he wasn\u2019t disturbed, he would spend two minutes to visualize an eight-column abacus in his mind and would slowly carry out eight digit calculations\u2026</mental>After Zhang Tie\u2019s spiritual energy surged seven times, all of his senses had become sharper. After each time he practiced <mental>, Zhang Tie was able to see a slight increase in spiritual energy that had been brought about by visualizing that golden abacus. Although he didn\u2019t know the reason, it still made him really excited. He had even begun to think about how he should share this method with his elder brother and Donder. After that incident about Huck and Snade, Zhang Tie always felt that he owed Donder. He could probably return the favor by telling him this secret, an effective method to increase spiritual energy. As Zhang Tie had never heard about this before, he believed that this was a great gift to show his sincerity to Donder. Since Donder had told him not to share the abacus skill with foreign clans, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t want to violate Donder\u2019s rule; therefore, he could not temporarily share this method with the other members of the brotherhood.</mental>About 1 hour after Zhang Tie got up, Barley and the other members climbed out of tree hollows one by one. Having not even washed his face, the moment Barley saw Zhang Tie sitting in that pit, Barley was pretty surprised. \u201cWasn\u2019t it Sharwin\u2019s turn to keep watch last night? Where\u2019d he go?\u201d\u201cI got up early and couldn\u2019t go back to sleep, so I let Sharwin go back and get some nice rest!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, Barley became silent and rapidly climbed off the tree. He then went to the stream and washed his face and mouth. Followed by Barley, the other guys also woke up one by one\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter everyone made preparations, with the exception of Sharwin, who was staying in the base, the others all went to see how Zhang Tie trapped the golden threadfin breams.Ensuring that nobody followed them, the group of five carefully followed Zhang Tie up the stream to the place where Zhang Tie had set the traps. Before arriving at the location, they were already stunned by the sight before them\u2014there was a shoal of fish bigger than the size of an adult\u2019s palm surging in the water 2 m away from the mouth of the stream. This scene was also somewhat out of Zhang Tie\u2019s expectation. Zhang Tie hurriedly approached the pond and silently uncovered the twigs on it\u2026Like a bowl of treasure, the number of fish in the pond had increased over the night. Inside the pond, there were at least five golden threadfin breams that were not smaller than the ones from yesterday and at least ten other fish that varied in size. At the sight of the fish, everybody became excited\u2026Barley felt that his decision of having Zhang Tie join the Hit-Plane Brotherhood was the best decision he has every made. Although Bighead looked pretty average at school, but at the critical moment, he was reliable and brought many surprises; he really makes people admire him\u2026[1] Jack \u2013 A device used to lift heavy objectsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The sky was still clear two days ago, but on the evening of the same day, the sky became covered with dense clouds as heavy rain fell. It continued to rain until last night.Since it rained most of yesterday, most students chose to stay in their bases, and so did the members of Hit-Plane Brotherhood. Barley fetched a set of cards, and those guys spent the entire day playing cards in the tree hollow. That was a marvelous feeling. While it was heavily raining outside the base, they really enjoyed themselves in the tree hollows. Besides the sound that came from the raindrops falling onto tree leaves, no other sounds could be heard, as the insects and the birds had already hidden themselves. They could no longer hear the chirping of cicadas and birds. As the animals had already hidden themselves in such weather, naturally, it was not that easy to hunt them.On the eighth day since the start of the survival training, god then allowed them one day of break\u2026In the past eight days, the tree base had been further renovated. When they had free time or had no firewood to burn, they further expanded the previous three levels of space, resulting in each of them having more space to sleep. They also hung a bamboo curtain, which they obtained by exchanging it for food with the girls, outside each of the tree holes. In addition, they also gathered several old vines, and in one night, wove them into a simple vine ladder for them to climb up and down. On the third floor, they expanded several pits and moved in some soil, wildflowers, and green plants from the valley to make the tree base more pleasant.In the area under the tree, they dug a pond that was about 2 m2 and filled the bottom of the pond with pebbles and broken stones. They then dug a small ditch that was longer than 30m and cut several pieces of bamboo. Using the bamboo, they split the ditch from the middle and placed the pieces of bamboo inside, effectively creating a miniature water diversion system, which they used to start cultivating fish in the pond.Although the water in the pond could easily seep into the ground, with the fresh water constantly flowing in, the depth of the water in the pond remained above 50 cm at all times, which was sufficient for the shoal of fish to survive.After such renovation, the tree base had become completely different than before. A couple of days ago, they successfully invited a group of female students to visit their tree base and ate roasted fish together. As expected, with such an appealing tree base, those girls were greatly amazed, so much that they even entered the tree base to have a look. After those girls returned to Wild Wolf Castle, they began to tell the other girls at Wild Wolf Castle, thus causing their tree base to be well known among girls. Many girls started to learn of the male students who lived in a huge tree base and farmed fish inside a pond under the tree, and they knew if they were to visit, they would be able to drink delicious fish soup and eat roasted fish. Besides, it seemed that those male students worked hard and were able to hunt other beasts. Generally speaking, those boys were always able to obtain a sufficient amount of food. Once they set out to hunt, they would always return with something\u2026In order to allow the brothers of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood to not leave empty handed, Zhang Tie taught them how to dig those traps. In the recent days, under the collective hard work of the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, Barley and the rest had dug two traps that were deeper than 6m at a location about 5 km away from the tree base. These two traps, in addition to the fish trap that Zhang Tie made and the other traps made from twigs and stones to create small preys, greatly improved the living standard of the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. On the sixth day since the start of the survival training, they had successfully captured a wolf by placing the fish innards that oozed a fishy and terrible odor in the first pit. It was finally miserably shot to death by \u201cIron Gate T21\u201d. On the same day, the members of Hit-Plane Brotherhood also enjoyed roasted wolf meat for the first time and acquired their first wolf hide in this survival training. After experiencing the success of the traps, every one of them thoroughly enjoyed setting traps. If it were not for the rain, they would have already made a third deep pit.After they succeeded with their first trap, their tree base gradually became more and more famous. After feeling satisfied physically, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood started to dream about women. In the past couple of days, they had often frequented Wild Wolf Castle to pick up girls. Some of them had even successfully convinced some girls to work together to get through the survival training. For the girls, aside from having to return to Wild Wolf Castle each evening, they were free to do whatever they wanted. Realizing this, those male students worked harder. Many teams had gradually entered deeper into Wild Wolf Valley, as it was truly a paradise for beasts there. Naturally, they would be able to capture more difficult preys there.Wild Wolf Valley was naturally the paradise of wolves. In this age, even the species of wolves are categorized differently than the most universal categorization of animals. Wild wolves were the most common type, which did not differ to the wolves before the Catastrophe. According to the most universal classification of animals, wild wolves were categorized as Level 0 living beings, whose fighting force was equivalent to a common human soldier. A Huge Wolf was a Level 1 living being that had physically evolved and mutated after the Catastrophe and was much larger than the normal wolf. The Huge Wolf was much more fiercer, stronger, and more agile. A Golden Wolf was a Level 2 living being which had further evolved and mutated from a Huge Wolf. A Golden Wolf looked brilliant as it shone with gold all over and was also larger than a Huge Wolf. It was said that a matured Golden Wolf could easily kill three LV 1 human fighters. Above the Golden Wolf were the Level 3 Bloody Wolf and the rarely seen Level 4 Shadow Wolf, which was said to be the top of all the beasts and magical beasts that had been seen in Wild Wolf Valley in the past few decades. Actually, people had rarely seen beasts above Level 2 in the past decade, which was why Wild Wolf Valley was selected as the location for the survival training of the students of Blackhot City.Zhang Tie heard that no beasts above Level 4 were found in Wild Wolf Valley because there were once many Gold-Eating Boas here. Although those Gold-Eating Boas had been exterminated, their high-level Qi still lingered in this valley. The more advanced the beast or magical beast were, the more sensitive their Qi would be and the farther the beasts would stay away from them.On the sixth day since the start of this survival training and also the day before it started to rain, the team headed by Burwick from Seventh National Male Middle School besieged and killed four Huge Wolves. That was the first time for students to have hunted four Level 1 magical beasts at once. Burwick greatly shocked Wild Wolf Castle this time. A large number of female communities and teams requested to cooperate with Burwick. Compared to Glaze, who was hapless these days, Burwick really obtained a good reputation this time.One week after the survival training started, the excellent figures from the different schools also gradually stood out.When Burwick\u2019s group gained the four Huge Wolves, a male student from the another school who excelled in archery, the one Barley had mentioned to Zhang Tie, became well known as \u201cBowman Blues\u201d. In contrast to the achievements acquired by Burwick, which was obtained through a group effort, \u201cBowman Blues\u201d from Second National Male Middle School\u201d climbed atop a tree alone and shot two Huge Wolves to death. Compared to Burwick, Blues was an individual with more heroism and easily aroused the adoration from the girls. As a result, \u201cBowman Blues\u201d also became Mr. Perfect for every girl.Of course, there were more excellent figures among the four schools\u2026The blacksmith workshop in Wild Wolf Castle gave off black smoke around the clock. The cutleries and the swords as well as some of the productive tools made in the workshop had already been placed on the square for sale. In the same workshop, it was said that someone had already started to build the model of the first steam machine.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere were also two female students who were excellent characters. It was rumored that there was a girl who showed her superb skills of identifying and finding plants, as she had already easily found a 100 kg root of a kudzu vine buried in the soil. Another girl displayed her amazing ability of implementing administrative management, as she well organized all the items in the inner castle of Wild Wolf Castle. There was even one girl who was a LV 1 fighter, was even braver than most boys, and had already gone hunting with several friends, causing the other male students to be embarrassed.Those elites gradually showed off their talents, leading to this survival training becoming more and more boisterous.Compared to those glamorous figures, Zhang Tie\u2019s miserable life as a miner had seemingly just started. Two days ago, he went to dig traps with the other members of Hit-Plane Brotherhood. Yesterday, he took a break due to the rain. According to the regulations, if Zhang Tie wasn\u2019t able to submit more than 300 kg of iron ore today, then he would not be permitted to be a miner anymore.Therefore, the morning after the rain stopped, under the blessings and condolences of his brothers, Zhang Tie, once again, looked like a miner that was destined for the job. After checking his equipment, he silently carried that ugly mining basket and set off on his trip alone.\u201cThat is too miserable!\u201d The other members of Brotherhood sighed at the sight of Zhang Tie\u2019s back\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As a result, the morning air in the valley was pretty good. Zhang Tie seemingly could even smell the fragrance of the roadside grass. However, the path in the valley became very muddy and slippery this morning as a result of the rain, thus one may easily slip if they didn\u2019t pay attention to the condition of the path. Zhang Tie had no choice but to slow down his walking speed towards the mine that was several kilometers away.Soon after Zhang Tie left the tree base, he had already encountered two groups of students hunting for food, with each group consisting of more than ten people. When Zhang Tie passed them, those guys, at first, gave a look of amazement at his mining basket, but soon after, they cast a glare of contempt at Zhang Tie before raising their heads and striding away proudly\u2026In the past couple of days, Zhang Tie had already become immune to those contemptuous glares. Unknown when he had read it, Zhang Tie remembered a certain sentence\u2014a man who couldn\u2019t stand being alone would never grow up. In his current situation, for Zhang Tie, the current situation allowed him to grow alone.Growing along with Zhang Tie\u2019s heart was the Castle of Black Iron.After the past couple days of hard work, Zhang Tie had already accumulated 2000 basic energy storage by throwing baskets full of stones and iron ores into the Pool of Chaos within the Castle of Black Iron. The amount of basic energy storage in the Castle of Black Iron was several hundred times more than that before the start of the survival training. After having been converted into basic energy storage, the stones and mined ores quickly increased the strength of the Castle of Black Iron. With the amount of basic energy storage presently available in the Castle of Black Iron, it could already be used to make some slight changes to the topography of the Castle of Black Iron, for example a small pool However, Zhang Tie was currently not satisfied with just that amount; he wanted to accumulate more basic energy storage and then make a final decision once the survival training was over.In addition to the increasing basic energy storage, the aura value in the Castle of Black Iron has also been rapidly increasing. Zhang Tie had found that all the seeds gifted by Grandma Teresa had already sprouted and were growing well. In addition to the seeds from Grandma Teresa, the potatoes, niblets, sweet potatoes, and the pumpkins in his own land were all growing nicely as well.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know why, but in the past few days, he felt as if he was being followed on his way to the mines; however, this morning, the feeling of being followed was gone. This made Zhang Tie curious about whether he was going crazy again, but in the end, he didn\u2019t think too much about it.After the first rain in June, the valley had been covered with dandelions overnight. White hairy spheres of dandelions had already broken out from the ground one by one, seemingly waiting for the arrival of a gust of wind. At the sight of the cute dandelions, Zhang Tie felt pretty good. Without hesitation, he casually picked ten of the white hairy spheres from the dandelions and tossed them into his mining basket.\u2026\u2026Half an hour later, Zhang Tie arrived at the nearest mining cave, which was only a bit more than 200m away from Wild Wolf Castle. Many people had already been here to mine, and there was a small, rusty half-complete track, which was once used to transport carts, on the ground covered in weeds outside the mining cave, seemingly as if it was telling him that this place was once prosperous. This mining cave might have been very important in the past, but now it was just an abandoned place used by the unlucky students to do labor work in exchange for food.As it was too close to Wild Wolf Castle, it was easily noticed by the female students. Not many male students chose this mining cave as their base, as they were afraid of losing face under the gazes from the female students, thus this mining cave was not as lively as the other ones.Recently, there has been many new faces entering this mine to work, while many old faces would disappear. Zhang Tie guessed that there were more than ten people, including himself, who constantly came to this mine to work every day. Most likely because this job was not something to feel honor from and all the people who mined here were either introverted or didn\u2019t feel like talking, Zhang Tie had not even made a single bosom friend after working here for a while. However, this truly made Zhang Tie reassured; he could do whatever he wanted alone in the mining cave without having to worry about the others.There were many broken stones on the ground outside the mines, making it easier to walk since there was less mud. The entrance to the mines was large, measuring up to dozens of square meters. After arranging his equipment at the entrance of the cave and cleaning off the mud on his shoes using a rock, Zhang Tie took out a torch and a hoe before lighting up the torch as he held it while entering the mine\u2026Although it was still daytime, after walking for a dozen meters in the cave and taking two turns, it was hard to see anything in front of him. If Zhang Tie didn\u2019t have a torch, he would not be able to venture deeper at all. Thankfully, the road ahead was flat without too many obstacles, thus Zhang Tie continued to venture deeper on the jet black path.The illuminating torch and Zhang Tie\u2019s footsteps shocked several bats inside the cave, leading to the bats flapping their wings and making a loud noise. This would always frighten people entering the cave for the first time, and Zhang Tie was no exception. However, after having accessed the mine several times, Zhang Tie had become accustomed to it.The illuminating torch cast Zhang Tie\u2019s shadow onto the mining walls. As he walked forward, his shadow on the walls also accompanied him. Each time Zhang Tie entered, he could not help but peek at the jumping shadows on the walls of the mine that were brought about by the shaking of the illuminating rays from the torch. Besides his shadow, there were also many strange marks that were circular and similar to tire marks on the yellowish walls and the ground of the mine. Zhang Tie was sure those marks were not left by humans. Every time he saw those marks, Zhang Tie would think back to the legend of the Gold-Eating Boas told by Sharwin that happened at this place three decades ago. Walking down the hole that stretched underground with walls covered in weird marks and had a diameter of three to four meters, whenever Zhang Tie thought about how the exaggeratedly terrifying boas that could engulf everything it met that used to climb in this tunnel, he would always feel terrified, feeling as if there were monsters in the pitch darkness staring at him. Although he knew it was just his imagination, Zhang Tie would always accelerate his footsteps whenever he passed by those strange tunnels.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFaintly hearing the sounds of hoes knocking at ores in front of him, Zhang Tie slightly calmed down. After walking several hundred meters in the cave, he finally arrived at the other end of this tunnel, revealing a spacious area in front of him. This area was even larger than the city square of Blackhot City and looked like a natural karst cave. Zhang Tie only saw a few dim lights in the entire underground space. , which came from the torches of the people who had arrived before him; however, in this pitch darkness, the burning torches were just like dim oil lamps and could only brighten a small area. The sounds of knocking at ores constantly reverberated in this space. The sounds that reverberated inside this huge mine seemed to spread both far away and close. For people who had walked through the meandering tunnel, they would definitely let out a sigh of relief and would feel happy at the sight of the lights in the pitch darkness and upon hearing the reverberating knocking sounds\u2014well, at least that held true for Zhang Tie\u2026As usual, Zhang Tie chose a place that was more isolated and subtle to do his mining work; the place he chose to work in was in another tunnel that was artificially made in the underground space. Even if he were to light his torch, he would not be easily noticed by others within that tunnel. In addition, there were several other intersections and turns inside this tunnel that seemingly led deeper underground. Therefore, that was a pretty ideal place for Zhang Tie to do whatever he wanted.Arriving at where he usually worked, he set up a small trick at the entrance of the tunnel using several broken stones. This small trick would alert him if anyone entered the tunnel. After placing the stones at the entrance, Zhang Tie was able to completely relax.Fixing the torch into a crack on the wall of the mine, dozens of square meters of space before him were illuminated. He placed his mining basket on the ground and poured out the spare torches and dandelions from within. He then removed the dagger, the kettle, and the dried ration from his waist. After drinking some water, he took up his hoe and began to work hard to gather the required amount of ores, joining the other sounds of knocking and forming a chorus in the underground karst cave!Unknownst to Zhang Tie, who was mining in the cave underground, a messenger falcon had brought the latest news from Blackhot City to Wild Wolf Castle. The news it brought was a big event that had happened in Blackhot City yesterday, and that big event was rightly related to the letter Zhang Tie had sent. After a week of brewing, the storm in Blackhot City shook the entire Andaman Alliance, while the storm from yesterday seemed to symbolize the arrival of a greater storm\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As there was still an army residing within Wild Wolf Castle, every three days, the Blackhot City Military would use a messenger falcon to send a military notice to the castle, so the army stationed in the castle would be up-to-date with the current events in Blackhot City. After Wild Wolf Castle became the base for the students participating in the survival training, the recipients of the notice changed from the army to the members of the Temporary Supervision Committee and the students who were attending the survival training.Today, after having received and read the letter from Blackhot City that was brought by the messenger falcon, the teacher\u2019s face instantly turned pale. He then immediately summoned all the teachers and directors from every school attending the survival training in Wild Wolf Castle and loudly read the notice presented by the military of Blackhot City in the conference room\u2026Before listening to the contents of the letter, the people in the conference room were all relaxed; however, upon hearing the contents, all their faces turned blue. As a result, the conference room was filled with a solemn air and sound was no longer heard anymore. At that moment, if a needle were to fall onto the ground, the sound would be clearly heard by everyone\u2026The day before yesterday, Wild Wolf Castle welcomed the first rain of June. On that very day, a big event also occurred in Blackhot City\u2014the military of Blackhot City abruptly dispatched a large amount of soldiers to besiege the residence of the Niumuen Business Group on Bright Avenue of Blackhot City and forcefully carried out an investigation, using the excuse of searching for criminals. However, the forced investigation was met with a counterattack from the guards of the Niumuen Business Group. As expected, the guards of the Niumuen Business Group were completely cracked down and was completely purged by the iron first of Blackhot City\u2019s military. However, not only did the following investigation of the Niumuen Business Group\u2019s residence reveal that the fleeing fugitives were not there, but it also revealed something much more frightening. From the indisputable evidence and the interrogation of the director of the Niumuen Business Group of Blackhot City, a huge conspiracy was revealed\u2014the Niumuen Business Group had colluded with the Red-scarf Burglars in an attempt to look for an opportunity for the bandit group to wipe out the major clans that controlled the Coal, Steel, and Iron Federation of Blackhot City.Blackhot City officials had already delivered the news of this event to the Andaman Alliance last night, greatly shocking them. In the same evening after having received the notice, using its name, the Andaman Alliance submitted its strongest protest to the Norman Empire\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs in hopes to receive a reasonable explanation for the event that transpired in Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance. However, as the Norman Empire chose to remain quiet even until this morning, Blackhot City started to shut down all the industries and business groups of the Norman Empire within its territory, effectively stopping all business with the Norman Empire\u2026The arrival of the Red-scarf Burglars once again increased the tension in the atmosphere and caused the Blackhot City Military to raise its alertness to Level 1: Preparation for war\u2026The conference room in Wild Wolf Castle was filled with a weird and solemn air, as the actions of the Norman Empire made everyone breathless. In the eyes of Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance, the Norman Empire was truly a strong force. There was truly a great gap between the military forces of the two parties: Blackhot City had a military consisting of 50,000 and the Andaman Alliance had an army of 400,000 soldiers, while just the common soldiers on the northern border of the Norman Empire numbered 3 million. If the two parties were to start a war, just the army stationed at the northern border of the Norman Alliance alone could already wipe out the Andaman Alliance. Over the past few years, the major reason that the Andaman Alliance could stay in a peaceful state with the Norman Empire was not because the Andaman Alliance was strong, but rather because of the conflicts and contradictions between the Sun Dynasty and the Norman Empire. The Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty were both crazy, and when two crazy men stared at each other with the Andaman Alliance sitting between them, neither party would want to make the first move that would start the war. This situation remained unchanged for dozens of years. Blackhot City, who benefitted from this situation, was able to develop well in the past few decades. Now, it seems that one of the two crazy guys had become impatient\u2026\u201cDo we need to release this news to the students?\u201d one of the teachers sitting at the round desk made of pine wood thought for a while before finally proposing the question.\u201cI think it\u2019s unnecessary to tell them, as they will naturally know of it when they finish the survival training. Let \u2019em enjoy this temporary time of happiness\u2026\u201d Hearing his words, everyone else in the conference room stared at the kind-looking teacher. The teacher who just spoke gave a casual smile. \u201cEveryone, there has been peace in Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance for dozens of years, so why would the Norman Empire decide to start a war at this point in time? As we all know, since several weeks ago, the prices of strategic materials in all the countries of the Blackson Human Clan Corridor has been slowly rising. What does this mean? I think we all know the answer to this. Naturally, Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance are not worth all the countries in the Blackson Human Clan Corridor launching a war for.\u201dHearing his words, Captain Kerlin frowned. Although Captain Kerlin knew that that teacher\u2019s words contained something unusual, as he was neither highly intelligent nor excelled at analysis, he wasn\u2019t able to fully comprehend the meaning behind them. \u201cGerom, you\u2019re saying\u2026 a big war will break out\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d After looking around, Gerom gently sighed. \u201cWe are all small figures and are not able to make the big decisions. It\u2019s just that I remembered the end of the second holy war between humans and demons. It seems that more than 170 years has already passed\u2026\u201dHoly war!As if a -50 degrees celsius breeze had swept the room, the two words instantly froze the conference room. Hearing those two words, even Captain Kerlin\u2019s face turned pale\u2026\u2026\u2026This morning, Zhang Tie was not happy at all; not only was he not happy in the slightest, he was even depressed to death. Nobody would be happy if they spent their entire morning digging 300 kg of ores before carrying them using a mining basket as they walked 1.5 km to submit them in various locations several times. As the amount of iron in the ores varied from 50% and 60%, it was quite heavy for Zhang Tie to carry, as it would contain almost 200 kg of iron ores each time. For the students attending the survival training, it was impossible for them to carry 200 kg while walking a distance of 1.5 km. Let alone 200 kg, it was even difficult for them to carry 100 kg. For those who were able to carry 50 kg of ores while traversing a distance of 1.5kg, being able to return was already considered good enough. Although it was not difficult for one to dig ores and possibly even obtain up to several tons a day, the real test of strength was if they were able to bring the ores to the correct place.Zhang Tie kept working for the entire morning. Although he had only finished two-thirds of the mission today, Zhang Tie, as a Level 1 fighter, already felt fatigued all over; his body felt weak. After submitting the batch of ores that weighed over 70 kg, Zhang Tie received two packages of dried rations. Throwing himself onto the ground under the shade of a pine tree, he did not feel like picking himself up from the floor again.After this experience, Zhang Tie swore that he would dig in the mines every day regardless of the weather. Since he had to submit a minimum amount of ores each day, he realized he would truly be tortured to death if he had to finish three days worth of work in one day.Much like outside, there were small iron tracks which once allowed the usage of mining carts inside the mines; however, there was clear evidence that the iron tracks had been destroyed by some bastards. As a result, all miners had to walk approximately 0.5 km inside the tunnel, which sharply lowered the transportation efficiency.Like before, the guys who wanted to try out mining had already decided to leave after just the morning, and many people were reluctant to try it again for the second time.Leaning against a tree, Zhang Tie was drinking water and eating the dried ration. With slightly narrowed eyes, Zhang Tie looked up at the two happy squirrels on the tree. These days, the squirrels seemed to have noticed that a group of uninvited guests was stealing their pine cones, thus the two began to move the pine cones into their own tree hollow. They were even more diligent than Zhang Tie. Seeing the two busy squirrels, Zhang Tie became somewhat embarrassed, as he was one of the uninvited guests who had taken their pine cones, yet he was not even as diligent as a squirrel\u2026\u2026\u2026On the first day after the rain stopped, all the students began to be busy once more. It seemed that it was hard to associate the survival training with the word \u201chappiness\u201d. At a location 10 km away from mine where Zhang Tie was, as Zhang Tie leaned against a tree as he ate his dried rations, Glaze and his followers were doing something that was even harder to associate with the word \u201chappiness\u201d\u2026A cave within a mountain had already been filled with blood. After killing several female wolves, who were feeding pups, using his sword, Glaze swept through the 20 odd pups who were barely as big as a newborn dog. As the last pup wanted to bite at his heel, Glaze ferociously stomped down onto its head, smashing it into pieces. Only at this moment did the sad howls within the mountain cave finally stop.The instant the growls stopped, Sharon and Zuhair rushed in. They carefully avoided all the blood on the ground. Much like Glaze, Sharon\u2019s and Zuhair\u2019s skin had turned a pale green, seemingly as if a strange fluid had been pasted on them.\u201cHurry up, let\u2019s go. We won\u2019t have time to leave if the other wolves return\u2026\u201d Sharon urged.\u201cGlaze, your shoes have been dyed with wolf blood. You should throw them away. Otherwise, the wolves would come and look for you. Now, everybody should hurry up and leave this place. We should clean off the mixture of bitter taro roots and blood wolf flowers from our bodies. That way, nobody would know that we were responsible for this\u2026\u201d At the sight of the pup who had its head crushed under Glaze\u2019s foot, Zuhair cried out as he awkwardly took out a bag that was sealed in waterproof cloth. Opening the bag, Zuhair picked up a small piece of a towel using his two fingers and threw it on the ground.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter looking at the blood from the pups that stained his shoes, Glaze cursed and then quickly left the wolf den that reeked of death with Sharon and Zuhair.\u201cHave you finished your job?\u201d as they left, Glaze asked Zuhair.\u201cTrust me, I have already arranged the other pieces of his towel on the way. Those wild wolves will definitely find Zhang Tie on his way back to his base if they follow the odor trail created by the pieces from his towel. Wild wolves are both cunning and good at bearing grudges\u2026\u201d Zuhair smirked. \u201cA common soldier has nothing to do with us if he was engulfed by a pack of wild wolves!\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Glaze and his followers laughed out loudly\u2026Two hours later, all the male wolves hunting outside returned to their den. The instant they entered, their low howls started to reverberate throughout the entire valley\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_The ore collection center of Wild Wolf Castle was at the foot of a relatively flat hill south of Wild Wolf Castle. There was an iron rail that spanned hundreds of meters long down from the top of the hill to the collection center. The other end of the iron rail was the raw materials field of the iron smelting workshop in Wild Wolf Castle. The steam engine attached to the wheeled vehicle provided it enough energy so that it could pull carts filled with iron ores from the foot of the hill to the top using steel wires that were as thick as a baby\u2019s arm. Thanks to the iron rail and the vehicle that made use of the steam engine, iron ores could be easily brought into Wild Wolf Castle. If not for them, Zhang Tie really wondered whether there would be any person willing to dig in the mines, as they would have to walk a distance of over 1.5 km in order to reach this location while carrying the iron ores. In order to get here, he would have to walk up a slope and would most likely be tired to death after doing so.Although some people would be able to accomplish such a feat, others would find it difficult to do the same.At noon, after raining for a day, the sun finally rose, and it gradually became hot again. Due to the rain, the valley was still rather damp, but under the scorching sun, the water began to evaporate and rise from the ground. In a short period, the entire valley became a huge steaming cage that made people breathless.Under such a high temperature, it became a huge test as to whether Zhang Tie would be able to traverse a distance of over 1.5 km while carrying more than 100 kg of iron ores on his back. On the way there, Zhang Tie gritted his teeth as he oozed sweat all over and felt as if his shoulder was burning because his shoulder constantly rubbed against his mining basket. On average, he would have to take a rest after walking every 200 or 300 meters. Finally arriving at his destination, when Zhang Tie placed his mining basket on the scale, it made a \u201cKuang!\u201d sound. Upon hearing a different sound drifting from the scale, the other male students couldn\u2019t help but stare at the number displayed on the scale.118 kg!\u201cBrother, nice work. You are the first to carry over 100 kg of iron ores at once. It seems you were born to do this!\u201d Hearing his words, Zhang Tie did not feel like uttering a single word; he only rolled his eyes. Right now, he was extremely tired and wanted to take a rest for half an hour. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t have the strength to think about whether that guy was praising him or criticizing him. At the same time, the male student took out a notebook. After peering at the number displayed on the scale and checking the quality of the ores brought by Zhang Tie, he started to record the numbers in the notebook.\u201cAlong withs this basket\u2026 how many kilograms of ores have I carried here today?\u201d After panting for a quite while, Zhang Tie asked.\u201cIncluding this time, let me have a look\u2026\u201d Taking the notebook, the male student lowered his head and checked the record. \u201cYou are Zhang Tie, right? You brought in 76 kg the first time, 78 kg for the second time, and 69 kg for the third time. This time, you\u2019ve brought 118 kg. Let me calculate it\u2026\u201d\u201c341 kg\u2026\u201d The instant the male student told Zhang Tie of the weight of the iron he had brought the third time, Zhang Tie had already visualized a seven column abacus in his mind, from which poured out the final result.After calculating it with a pen, that male student got the same result as the one Zhang Tie got. Slightly amazed, he stared at Zhang Tie, but in the end, he didn\u2019t put too much thought into it.\u201cRight, it\u2019s 341 kg. This is the record for the most brought in. Since you didn\u2019t come in for the previous two days, you have just finished the amount needed for the past three days of required work\u2026\u201d\u201cIs there a reward for the highest record?\u201d Zhang Tie casually asked.\u201cThere is!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cYou will be allowed to continue this promising career\u2026\u201dHearing this answer, Zhang Tie\u2019s face slightly turned dark before beginning to laugh. He didn\u2019t expect this guy to have a sense of humor.Seeing them pouring his iron ores into the mining vehicle, Zhang Tie casually prattled with them and took a rest. Based on the weight of his iron ores, Zhang Tie received 0.35 kg of dried rations. Afterwards, bringing with him the dried rations, Zhang Tie carried the ugly mining basket and climbed to the top of the mountain, arriving at the square outside Wild Wolf Castle.After having removed the 100 kg burden and taking a break, Zhang Tie gradually recovered his strength and realized that he was much faster than before. This time, since he successfully surpassed his own physical limit and was able to create a record among the group of unlucky fellows, Zhang Tie was in a good mood and felt a bit pleasant. It seemed that what Donder had said was true\u2014people were always forced to conquer difficulties before they were able to succeed. That was really sincere saying that was often seen in Chinese texts.As the sun had risen again, the square became more boisterous than before. Compared to the empty and shabby appearance that was here before, there were now some simple trading booths that could also be used as shelter in the square. At these booths, some of the female students would sell the wild fruits and vegetables that they had picked in the valley and would trade them for other food. At the other end of the square, the male students, as usual, grouped together as they showed off their \u201cmuscles\u201d and the prey they had caught. Over time, they would find an opportunity to chat with girls. These days, more and more female students had begun to form solid teams with the male students. No matter whether they were male or female, after some time and after understanding each other, they became rather bold.\u201cDo you need blueberries or hawthorn fruits?\u201d A voice from a booth to the side attracted Zhang Tie\u2019s attention. Turning around, Zhang Tie saw a male student shaking his head and walking away, while the owner of the booth, a female student, looked disappointed as she hugged her legs and sat on the ground. In front of the girl was a lotus leaf on which were a pile of unripe wild blueberries and hawthorn fruits that amounted to less than 0.25 kg. Much like the bashful female owner of the booth, the pile of blueberries and hawthorn fruits looked average. Although they were clean, they were not attractive at all and were not able to arouse the \u201cappetite\u201d of the horny students.As Zhang Tie remembered that he had not spread the seeds of blueberries and hawthorn fruits on the soil in the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie walked over and squatted in front of that poor girl\u2019s booth. \u201cWhat do you want in exchange for these fruits?\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s voice, the dejected girl raised her head up from her knees. Although she had freckles on her face, she looked clean and had an average figure; however, she had a pair of blue eyes that were crystal clear, much like a stream of water. She was just like an ugly duckling dwarfed by the brilliant beauties around her.\u201c0.25 kg of dried rations for both the wild blueberries and the hawthorn fruits. Ah, if you just give me 0.2 kg of dried rations, you can take them away. I\u2019m also willing to trade for 0.1 kg of meat.\u201d Feeling that Zhang Tie was slightly glancing over her body, the girl sitting on the ground leaned a bit more forward, hiding her chest behind her knees.\u201cGulugulu\u201d Clear growling sounds drifted from the stomach of that girl into Zhang Tie\u2019s ears. At the same time, the girl lowered her head in embarrassment.\u201cFine, I want them all\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie casually took out 0.5 kg of dried rations from his food container. After thinking for a short time, he added 0.05 kg of dried beef to the dried rations.\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 is too much!\u201d The girl was surprised; her pair of beautiful blue eyes gazed at Zhang Tie without blinking, seemingly as if she wanted to find something on Zhang Tie\u2019s face.\u201cHmm\u2026 I am a disciple of the Guardian God School. During this survival training, I want to collect some seeds from various plants. As you can see from my looks, you should know that I dig in the mines and have no time to do this. If it\u2019s convenient for you and as long as it\u2019s safe, could you please collect some seeds for me? Whatever they are, I\u2019ll exchange food with you. The extra food is paid in advance.\u201d Zhang Tie casually said.\u201cReally?\u201d The girl\u2019s eyes instantly became shiny.Smiling, Zhang Tie put away the two piles of slightly unripe fruits and then pushed the dried rations and dried beef in front of the girl. His actions were more persuasive than any words. Seeing his actions, the girl firmly took the food, seemingly as if she feared Zhang Tie would change his mind.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\u201cI am Zhang Tie!\u201d\u201cAfter I collect seeds, how will I find you?\u201d\u201cI come here often, so you don\u2019t need to come look for me. I\u2019ll come look for you!\u201dAs he said this, Zhang Tie picked himself up and took away those fruits. After seven or eight steps away, Zhang Tie heard the timid voice from the girl behind him. \u201cI am Pandora\u2026\u201dZhang Tie turned around and showed a smile to the girl. He then picked up a hawthorn fruit and stylishly tossed it into the air, letting it fall into his mouth; however, upon biting it, Zhang Tie instantly frowned, as it was really sour. What a failure! Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s expression, Pandora giggled. Almost at the same time, she hurriedly covered her mouth with her hands, as she realized that she was the one who had sold him the hawthorn fruit. Raising her head to look at Zhang Tie again, she realized the black-haired adolescent with the mining basket on his back was waving at her before gradually disappearing among the crowd\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cZhang Tie\u2026\u201d Pandora muttered this name several times.\u2026\u2026After finishing today\u2019s work, Zhang Tie felt relaxed all over. Whistling, he began to climb down the mountain while eating the sour blueberries and hawthorn fruits. He then returned to the place where he had dug in the mines. As there were still four or five hours before he would leave the mine, he could casually spend them to do whatever he wanted. At this time, the hidden mining tunnel had become the best place for him to practice cultivation. In addition, after working in the morning, there were fewer people inside the mines, and the knocking sounds became sparser.Sitting down on the relatively clean ground in the mine as he crossed his legs, Zhang Tie entered the cultivation state. As he had just finished carrying over 100 kg iron ores to the right location, he currently felt that he was in the perfect condition, as he felt relaxed and full of strength all over. Zhang Tie had once heard that every time a person broke through their physical limits, they would see a better effect when cultivating. At this moment, he decided to give it a try for the remaining hours\u2026\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_For the entire afternoon, Zhang Tie was practicing cultivation inside the mines. He felt as if time had flown really fast during the process!When he walked out of the mining cave, the afterglow of the setting sun had already covered the entire Wild Wolf Valley with a golden color. With narrowed eyes, Zhang Tie peered over the peaceful and beautiful valley. Only after a while was Zhang Tie\u2019s able to gradually adapt to the scenery before him.Currently, he was feeling pretty good, seemingly because of the effects of today\u2019s cultivation, which changed the color of the burning point at his rear end to a slightly red color; he never felt better. If it were not for those sparsely lit torches that reminded Zhang Tie that it was already almost dusk, Zhang Tie would have wanted to stay another several hours inside the mine to increase the amount of basic energy storage in the Castle of Black Iron.Before leaving the mine, Zhang Tie sat in the mining tunnel he had dug in and entered the Castle of Black Iron once again. The whole process only lasted less than three minutes. Entering the Castle of Black Iron with Zhang Tie were the seeds of wild blueberries and hawthorn fruits. After rapidly running a lap around the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie had casually spread the seeds onto the ground and checked the second Leakless Fruit before promptly exiting.There was another 56 hours left before the second Leakless Fruit would become ripe. Seeing its progress, Zhang Tie felt very satisfied. However, at the same time, he felt a tinge of regret when he looked at the progress bar of the Iron Body Fruit, as it had remained unchanged. The progress of the Iron Body Fruit had probably stalled as he hasn\u2019t been to the fighting club to be a flesh bag for the past couple of days. After gazing at that unripe Iron Body Fruit for a while, Zhang Tie suddenly came to the conclusion that he was really impatient and began to curse himself inwardly.At this moment, those horny male students at Wild Wolf Castle were pretending to be gentlemen despite thinking of dirty things as they invited girls to have supper with them. Over the course of a week, some of the horny male students had already become well acquainted with the female students as they climbed down the mountain hand in hand while chatting happily with each other. This truly made Zhang Tie unhappy and uncomfortable. At the sight of such students, he could only touch his nose and forced a self-mocking smile before heading for the tree base.On the way back, Zhang Tie was thinking about the achievements of Barley and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, wondering if they had successfully invited a group of girls to visit their tree base. Everything he had learned before the start of the survival training regarding the dangers in this place had already been forgotten by him. Zhang Tie himself was most likely the last person who would encounter any danger as a miner, despite having broken two records since the start of the survival training. Even if he met a wolf, would they really be able to pose any danger to him?In the valley, as he thought of wolves, a pleasant smile drifted onto Zhang Tie\u2019s face as a night breeze blew past it. If he were to truly meet a wolf at this moment, he would only regard himself as lucky and treat it as another gift from god. Despite it being a dagger, it was still a weapon; as a LV 1 fighter with a weapon, dealing with a wild wolf was as hard as carrying 100 kg of iron ores and walking a distance of 1.5 km. Although it was somewhat hard work, it still wasn\u2019t dangerous\u2026However, danger would always arrive before one has become well-prepared. It would appear before you like a collapsing mountain, and if you were to make a mistake, you might be broken into pieces.20 minutes after Zhang Tie left the mining cave, Zhang Tie had already walked several kilometers. Just as he passed by a small patch of grassland and was about to walk through it, Zhang Tie suddenly stopped.At that moment, his heart suddenly began to pound heavily while blood all over his body rushed to his head. In a split second, Zhang Tie felt dazed and worried as his face turned pale.Blood sense!The same blood sense he felt when he encountered Huck and Snade.This grassland was only half a person tall and was more than 30 m away from Zhang Tie. Beside that grassland was a path which Zhang Tie used to walk on everyday. Facing the breeze, the grass were swaying in a manner akin to wheat waving in the wind, seemingly as if something was hiding within.Zhang Tie instantly became covered in cold sweat, as he had realized that something terrifying was staring at him within the grass. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know whether the thing hidden in the grass was man or animal. At the same time, the first thing Zhang Tie thought about was Glaze\u2019s group, wondering whether they had set an ambush and were waiting to kill him over there.Slowly putting down his mining basket, Zhang Tie took out the hoe from within the basket. At the same time, he pulled out the ordinary dagger which his elder brother had gifted to him in hopes that he would protect himself with it. As for that poisonous dagger gifted to him by Donder, Zhang Tie had already placed it in the Castle of Black Iron.With two weapons in hand, Zhang Tie slightly recovered his composure. Widening his eyes, he gazed at that patch of grassland, wanting to see through what was hiding inside. If it was Glaze\u2019s group, Zhang Tie swore inwardly that he would definitely beat them fiercely\u2026The breeze gradually became heavier while the grass was still swaying. However, at this time, Zhang Tie saw something that were akin to rocks in the grass, which changed the form of the grass as they swayed. Before his spiritual energy had sharply increase, Zhang Tie would never have noticed such minute details; however, after his spiritual energy sharply augmented, he was easily able to capture such a slight change. Forcefully swallowing his saliva, Zhang Tie slowly moved backwards; however, the moment Zhang Tie moved backwards, those hidden rocks also moved forward, splitting the grass as they moved towards Zhang Tie step by step.Then, a wolf drilled out from the grass with eyes fixed on Zhang Tie\u2026A wolf? Soon after, Zhang Tie slightly became relaxed, but at the sight of the other six wolves who drilled out from the grass, his tension once again intensified\u2026With red eyes, all seven wolves only glared at Zhang Tie. After looking straight into the eyes of those wolves, Zhang Tie could already feel their mood. They did not show a greedy expression like the one that would be present when they\u2019re hunting, but instead, they showed hatred\u2014a hatred so deep that they would not let him go even after draining the last drop of his blood.Why do these wolves hate me? Zhang Tie was completely dumbfounded. At this moment, the only thing he knew was that he would probably lose his life this time. Seeing them gradually bare their snow-white fangs as they lowered their bodies, when Zhang Tie heard \u201cgulugulu\u201d sounds drifting from the inside of their throats, Zhang Tie could feel all the fine hair on his body standing on their ends\u2026Zhang Tie instantly turned around and started to run. At that moment, he spent every single bit of effort to stride forward. Zhang Tie\u2019s mind was as clear as a crystal; various information flashed in his mind at the same time\u2026Currently, he was no less than 30 m away apart from the wolves. If he didn\u2019t spend every ounce of his effort into escaping, then with his current speed, he would only have a bit more than 20 seconds before they caught him, as he was not their match in terms of speed with his current capabilities\u2026Once they caught up, he would have less than 30 seconds to choose between life and death choices. Within those 30 seconds, he could only try his best to kill one or two wolves; however, the time it took him to do that was enough for the remaining wolves to tear through his stomach or crush his throat. The moment he was knocked down against those wolves, he would be doomed \u2026If he wanted to enter the Castle of Black Iron, he needed at least ten seconds\u2014no, nine seconds. In order to enter, he would need to be calm, which meant that he could not be disturbed during the nine seconds before he entered the Castle of Black Iron. Obviously, he did not have enough time at this instance, and the Castle of Black Iron would not be able to help him get out of his current predicament\u2026As there was nobody nearby, Zhang Tie realized that nobody would be able to save him within 50 seconds, thus he only had one choice: he had to disappear from the sight of those wolves within the next 20 seconds since he would be killed the moment they caught up\u2026He could neither run as fast as the wolves nor could he rely on other people. His last beacon of hope was to take advantage of the topography and trees 200 m behind him.The best terrain to take advantage of would be water, assuming it was present. Unfortunately, there was no water nearby; however, luckily, there were many trees behind him. The fact that he was not the least bit good at climbing trees implied that he wouldn\u2019t be able to reach a safe height. At this moment, the last choice appeared in his mind, one which might be his last beacon of hope.The train of thoughts almost flashed in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind within 0.1 second. Within such a short period, Zhang Tie had already determined his final plan to escape. If it were the others, 90% of them would choose to escape towards the direction of Wild Wolf Castle, where it was populated, dreaming about a slight chance of surviving against the pursuit of the wolves; however, Zhang Tie realized that this choice would not work for him\u2014if he chose this option, he would die within fifty seconds. The other 10% would just escape without knowing the direction, as they just wanted to stay away from those wolves, resulting in most of them dying even faster than the other 90% who would die within fifty seconds. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t choose this option either. Instead, he chose to rapidly run towards a specific place for the last beacon of hope\u2026Certainly, it was not enough to just escape. He would never give up, not even losing a bit of hope. As an adolescent with great ambitions in the new age, he could not follow the masses and just wait for death; therefore, the moment he turned around to escape, Zhang Tie used all his efforts to shriek loudly, creating a really terrifying shriek.\u201cHelp\u2026\u201dSuch a voice shocked numerous birds in the valley, causing them all to fly away\u2026After such a high-pitched shriek, Zhang Tie used all of his strength to run, closely followed by the seven red-eyed wild wolves. They gradually narrowed the distance between them and Zhang Tie.\u2026\u2026As expected, the last \u201chelp\u201d was heard by more than thirty male and female students who were roasting meat on the top of a hill more than three hundred meters away. In a split second, they hurriedly took up their weapons and ran out of the woods. One of them was that red-haired beauty who had previously kicked Zhang Tie. From the top of the hill, they witnessed the \u201cfinal seconds\u201d of Zhang Tie in this world\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe wolves had finally caught up with Zhang Tie, and some of them charged at him, yet their attacks were avoided by him. As if he had an eye on the back of his head, the moment a wolf jumped into the air towards him, he would swiftly move to the side while raising his dagger and slashing the stomach of the wolf. Another wolf charged at him, yet its lower jaw was ferociously smashed by a hoe, causing it to give a miserable howl that was even more high-pitched than Zhang Tie\u2019s \u201chelp\u201d that had drifted to their ears. Meanwhile, another wolf had already fiercely bitten Zhang Tie\u2019s shin, pulling him down onto the ground. As the other wolves pounced towards him, the youth instantly stabbed out his dagger at the wolf that was biting his shin. Pulling away the wolf using one hand, he jumped into a jet black hole beside him\u2026The decisiveness and braveness of Zhang Tie\u2019s \u201cfinal seconds\u201d deeply shocked those boys and girls who stood on the top of the hill. Seeing Zhang Tie jumping into that bottomless hole, tears began to drip from the faces of many girls. Among them, only Kristine could recognize that boy who was fighting wolves using his hoe.Perhaps I shouldn\u2019t have kicked him while we were in the square even though he had thought about doing that with me in his mind\u2026Thinking about this, Kristine slightly felt guilty. As a breeze blew over her face, the girl suddenly felt a slight chill on her face\u2026For the commoners, they were in an age where youth was as short as the morning dew, while life was as short as a straw.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Within a short span of time, he had already stabbed that wolf\u2019s heart and stomach four times before finally feeling the jaw of the wolf who had bit his shin completely lose its strength.At this moment, he had completely forgotten the injury on his shin. Raising his head, he kept his eyes fixed on the constantly narrowing space ahead\u2026 As one of the deepest cave left by the Gold-Eating Boas in Wild Wolf Valley, this was a bottomless pitch-dark hole with a diameter greater than three meters and was also the only chance for Zhang Tie to survive the attack of the wolves.Being closely chased by seven wolves, Zhang Tie could only survive by doing two actions. The first action he had to take was to jump into the hole before being caught by the wolves within 20 seconds, which he finally successfully accomplished despite being injured. The second action depended on luck; if this cave completely led to the ground without any obstructions, then he would fall to the ground and die miserably\u2014though, that would still be better than turning into wolf sh*t.Zhang Tie was betting his life in this wager; however, he did have two assumptions on which he based his actions on. The first assumption was that Gold-Eating Boas would not be that silly to drill a hole like a well, which directly led to the ground, and would always have curved paths, thus Zhang Tie thought that as long as there were any curved sections in the hole that did not lead to the ground, then he would be able to save himself.The second assumption was that the wolves would not follow him and jump into this pitch black hollow. Zhang Tie was right with this assumption, though the wolves did linger around the mouth of the hole for quite a while. From this point forward, Zhang Tie would have to rely on his first assumption\u2014whether the first turn would appear before Zhang Tie fell to the ground and died a miserable death.Zhang Tie dropped at a fast speed together with the wolf. By the time he had stabbed the wolf four times, the tunnel had already become completely dark since the sunlight could no longer reach inside.Zhang Tie and the wolf continued to fall inside that cave\u2026Even Zhang Tie himself didn\u2019t know why he was currently extremely calm despite the critical situation. Although he was also afraid of death, Zhang Tie currently felt no emotions and was precisely like a machine that was calculating and outputting data\u2026 Interestingly enough, at that moment, Zhang Tie was not thinking about life or death, but rather right or wrong\u2026At this moment, when Zhang Tie raised his head to look at the mouth of the tunnel from within, he had already calculated within 0.1 seconds that he was just 10-15 away from it, meaning that he had already been falling inside the hole for 1-2 seconds. He even thought of the formula he had learned at school: D=D\u2019(2t-1), where D is the distance he had fell in the cave and D\u2019 was the free falling distance within the first second, which was 5m on the Kun\u2019ang Continent. Using this formula, Zhang Tie could easily calculate the time which was safe to land. He would fall 5 meters in the first second, 15 meters in the next second, 25 meters in the third second, and 35 meters in the fourth second. He gave up calculating the falling distance for the fifth second. Even if there was a turn or a slope less than 90\u00b0 after four seconds, on the premise that his bones were not as hard as stones, he would definitely become heavily wounded or die the moment he hit the ground or the walls inside.\u201cWill I be the first person to die during this survival training? I\u2019m still a virgin, f*ck!\u201dA thought flashed by in his mind. Zhang Tie, who was free falling, used his feet to clamp onto the wild wolf that was under him, using it as a cushion, and tightly clasped the hoe\u2026Zhang Tie\u2019s fate depended on the next three seconds. Although three seconds would pass by very fast for someone else, for Zhang Tie, three seconds would feel as long as thirty seconds when he concentrated his spiritual energy.As a matter of fact, god didn\u2019t abandon Zhang Tie. Between the third second and the fourth second after he had fallen in\u2014to be precise, right after the third second\u2014that critical turn finally arrived, and the inclination became about 70 to 80 degrees. Certainly, Zhang Tie had no time to measure the concrete inclination. As he fell, when Zhang Tie felt the wild wolf beneath him hit something, he instinctively stabbed the hoe into the rocks, causing the sparks flying from the friction between the hoe and the rocks to illuminate Zhang Tie\u2019s serious face, one which showed his desire to survive. He felt as if his arms were breaking, but he also felt his speed decreasing. Finally, his legs hit a surface. To soften the impact, he instantly began to roll along the steep walls like a ball of meatball, rolling times within a short span of time.Even Zhang Tie himself did not know how long he had been in the darkness. His body continued to roll several times and collided with many things before finally a huge collision came, causing Zhang Tie\u2019s consciousness to fade into darkness.\u2026\u2026When Zhang Tie lost consciousness, the news of a black-haired miner being attacked to death by seven wild wolves 3.5km away from Wild Wolf Castle had already spread and shocked many people.The news was first brought back to Wild Wolf Castle by the students who had witnessed Zhang Tie\u2019s \u201cheroic\u201d actions before he jumped into the deep hole. Hearing the news, everyone in Wild Wolf Castle was shocked.\u2026\u2026\u201cI heard that a male student was bitten to death by wolves\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! But I heard he was really brave and had killed three wolves before being killed!\u201d\u201cWhere were his partners? Which team did he belong to? How could a brave male student like him face those wild beasts alone?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s alone and did not belong to any team. I heard he\u2019s a black-haired miner\u201d\u201cWhat a pity\u2026\u201dIn a room with many girls in the inner castle of Wild Wolf Castle, two female students were talking about the event that had transpired. Without paying too much attention to their surroundings, one of the two girls described the guy who was killed by the wolves as a \u201cblack-haired miner\u201d. Hearing her words, a girl who was quietly eating dried rations in a corner of the room suddenly became stiff all over. Then, along with her pearl-like tears, the dried rations fell from her hands, and she lowered her head as she hugged her knees as tightly as she could before finally hiding in a dark corner in the room.\u201cPandora, could you not stay in the corner all day and scare everyone? If you like that corner that much, why not directly move your quilt over or just move out of this room? That way, we wouldn\u2019t have to stay with a hapless woman like you\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! How could we be so unlucky to have been assigned to stay with this unlucky star? These past few days when I went out to search for wild vegetables, I was almost bitten by a poisonous snake\u2026\u201d Another two girls entered the room and began to fiercely curse the moment they saw the figure in the corner, not caring in the least about how that girl in the corner felt.Hearing their criticism, Pandora, the curled up figure in the corner, didn\u2019t utter a single word. She simply just stretched out her hand from the shadow and picked up the tear-stained dried ration on the ground and continued to eat it silently\u2026\u2026\u2026As for the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, it was time for supper, yet they realized that Zhang Tie had not yet returned. After waiting for him for a while, they started to realize that something bad had happened to Zhang Tie, thus while two of them remained to keep watch of the tree base, Barley, Leit, Doug, and Bagdad left the tree base. Agreeing with Leit\u2019s suggestion, they lit torches and began to search for Zhang Tie along the route he usually took when walking to the mine while Doug, who carried the terrifying machine bow, walked at the front. About halfway to the mine and about several hundred meters from where Zhang Tie had encountered the seven wolves, they saw many jumping lights, as many people were gathered there with burning torches, causing them to stare at each other in confusion. Barley\u2019s group of four rushed over and pulled one of the student\u2019s hand, asking about what was happening.\u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the news?\u201d that male student even curiously asked Barley.\u201cWhat news?\u201d\u201cIn the evening, a student who did mining work was mauled by seven wild wolves to death. He was a really great guy. It\u2019s said that he had killed three wild wolves before being killed\u2026\u201dHearing this news, the faces of the group of Barley instantly turned pale. Thinking that Zhang Tie was not powerful enough to kill three wolves at once, Barley asked in a quivering voice, \u201cDo you know that miner\u2019s name?\u201d\u201cThe castle officials had verified it just now. He\u2019s a Chinese student called Zhang Tie!\u201d\u201cBighead\u2026\u201d Doug growled like a wolf as he rushed towards the most crowded place with the most burning torches. In his opinion, Zhang Tie\u2019s corpse must have been too horrible to see.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen the four of them rushed ahead with red eyes, they gaped at the scene as the site was surrounded by a group of on-duty students who were wearing red armbands with torches in hand. Nobody was allowed to get any closer, but through the crowd, they were able to see a terrifying, jet-black hole and the corpse of two wild wolves. Several teachers were standing over there, discussing something, while Zhang Tie\u2019s corpse could not be seen.\u201cZhang Tie, Zhang Tie, he\u2019s our brother. We want to see him!\u201d Barley shouted\u2026\u201cQuiet, I heard Zhang Tie already rolled into the hole with a wolf. Captain Kerlin and the other teachers were talking about how to scoop him out of there\u2026\u201d a student who was responsible for keeping order and protecting the scene warned them.\u201cBighead fell into that hole\u2026\u201d Seeing that terrifying hole, a slight bit of hope could be seen shimmering in the eyes of Barley and Doug\u2026\u201cMr. Zerom\u2026\u201d Seeing a teacher coming over here, many on-duty students greeted him. Nodding towards them, the teacher entered the site and walked towards several teachers from the Temporary Supervision Committee and Captain Kerlin\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As casualties would happen every year during the survival training, the Temporary Supervision Committee, despite being the ones to organize the survival training, were not responsible for any student casualties; however, they were expected to give a reasonable explanation to the student\u2019s school as well as to the student\u2019s parents. All seven teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee were expected to report on that incident. Although the report was systematic, it was also very necessary. After all, it was a matter of life. Although the teachers and coaches didn\u2019t have to take responsibility for it, they should at the very least clearly explain to the parents how their child had died.After receiving the news about Zhang Tie in Wild Wolf Castle, Captain Kerlin, Mr. Zerom, and the other five teachers and coaches soon arrived at where Zhang Tie had encountered the attack; they had come to to investigate what had happened.Mr. Zerom was the best among them at drawing information from trivial clues. Walking along the path between where Zhang Tie had dropped his basket and the jet-black hole twice, he had even lowered his body by the patch of grass, the place where the wild wolves had set ambush, for a short while before returning to the other members of the Temporary Supervision Committee with a strange look on his face.\u201cHow is it, Zerom?\u201d Captain Kerlin\u2019s face was slightly dark. He remembered that Zhang Tie was one of the rare students among the undergraduates who were able to impress him. He would never have thought that it would have been Zhang Tie who was attacked by the wolves. This really made him depressed, as what happened to Zhang Tie reminded him of those days when his comrades-in-arms and friends left the mortal world during a battle.\u201cThat is terrifying, really terrifying\u2026\u201d Mr. Zerom looked very solemn.\u201cCertainly. For someone to encounter such an incident, it is truly terrifying. These kinds of incidents have not occurred in more than a decade within the area 5 km from Wild Wolf Castle. As the guards from the castle always swept the areas near the castle, the wolves had become too afraid to appear at all. Nobody knows why a group of wolves would suddenly appear in an area so close to the castle.\u201d At the sight of the two corpses of wolves on the ground, a female teacher slightly shook her head and sighed. \u201cWhat a pity! Judging from the wounds on the bodies of the wild wolves and what the students who saw the fight had said, this student called Zhang Tie should be quite formidable if he didn\u2019t die. From his braveness, his decisiveness, and his intelligence, Zhang Tie should already be among the best of those at his age\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean this incident is terrifying. I meant that the student called Zhang Tie is terrifying\u2026\u201d Zerom shook his head. Hearing his comments, all the other teachers looked over at Zerom.\u201cWhat do you mean by that student is terrifying?\u201d one teacher asked.Zerom replied with a slight smile. Then, he turned around and talked to Captain Kerlin. \u201cHow did this student usually perform at school? Was he one of the recommended students from your school?\u201d\u201cHe was pretty normal at school and had no outstanding performance during the past three years. He was only a bit smart and had a good temperament\u2026\u201d Slightly frowning, although Captain Kerlin did not like the way Zerom spoke, he still answered truthfully and added, \u201cOh, I almost forgot. This guy was also good at escaping and bringing benefits to himself. As for the recommended students, everybody at school had a good impression of Glaze and Burwick. Currently, Zhang Tie hasn\u2019t yet been qualified to be recommended. Zerom, why are you asking this? What do you mean by Zhang Tie is terrifying?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not worth your recommendation?\u201d Zerom looked in surprise at Captain Kerlin and smiled. \u201cSuch an excellent student, yet you don\u2019t have a favorable impression of him? After surveying the route from the patch of grass over there to this black hole, I have done some mental calculations. Do you guys know what I have discovered?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIn order to save his own life, that student had already decided to jump into this black hole the moment he saw the seven wild wolves drilling out of the grass.\u201d\u201cIs that very special?\u201d a teacher dubiously asked. \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything out of place over there. If he knows he\u2019s weak, isn\u2019t it just a human\u2019s natural instinct to run away from wild wolves?\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s strange\u2026\u201d Zerom solemnly replied. \u201cIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s human instinct to run when confronted with danger; however, what makes it terrifying is knowing how to escape in face of danger. This black hole is about 200 meters away from where he had encountered the wolves, and it is also the only place within the area where he would have a chance to escape from the wolves. In most cases, people would choose to run towards Wild Wolf Castle or to any other populated areas, but this guy escaped towards this black hole, which is the best path of survival for him. That\u2019s why I said he was terrifying. The moment he began to escape, he had already calculated the various possibilities of survival in every direction and had even calculated the time he had before he would be caught by the wolves and the distance he could run within that time\u2026\u201dSeeing as how some of the members of the Temporary Supervision Committee were still confused about what he had said, Zerom drew a point on the ground using a twig. \u201cLet\u2019s use this point as the place where Zhang Tie had encountered the wolves\u2026\u201d Surrounding that point, Zerom drew a circle. \u201cThis circle represents the farthest he can get before he would be caught by the wolves. It\u2019s about 200m\u2026\u201d After he finished drawing the circle, Zerom marked a spot on the edge of the circle. \u201cAnd this is the position of the black hole, which is also where we currently are. The only place he could escape from those wolves is precisely this point. If it were any other point within the circle, that guy would have been torn apart by the wolves. That\u2019s why I said this student called Zhang Tie is terrifying. For him to be able to precisely choose his best route of survival among thousands of choices before the wolves began their chase\u2014that is truly terrifying!\u201dThis time, everybody understood. Looking at the two points on the ground, everybody became slightly shocked. Like Zerom had said, starting from the center point, there were many places where one could run to escape from the pursuing wolves. Thankfully, the route Zhang Tie had chosen was the only one with a little hope.\u201cWhat if\u2026 it was a coincidence?\u201d a teacher asked in doubt after hesitating. To make such a precise judgement at such a critical moment, let alone students, even teachers couldn\u2019t do it.\u201cDon\u2019t forget, the students mentioned that the guy had brought a hoe with him when he was escaping\u2026\u201d\u201cIs that special? Isn\u2019t it just human instinct to pull out a weapon when chased by wolves?\u201d\u201cHis weapon was a dagger, not a hoe. Using a hoe would slow him down when he\u2019s escaping, so the only reason for the hoe was to look for an opportunity when he jumped into the dark hole. Since the hole was dug by a Gold-Eating Boa, they would not lead straight to the ground. Once he finds a slope that\u2019s not too sleep, he would be able to use the hoe to slow down his falling speed\u2026\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying, Zhang Tie might still be alive?\u201d Captain Kerlin curiously opened his mouth and looked at the black hole before turning back to Zerom.\u201cIn my memory, guys like him are hard to kill, and their resilience is usually greater than a cockroach\u2019s!\u201d\u201cI want to go inside!\u201d Captain Kerlin said.\u201cI will accompany you when the rope is sent here from the castle\u2026\u201d Rubbing his jaw with one hand, Zerom was filled with curiosity about the guy called Zhang Tie. It was rare to see a student be able to calmly make precise decisions in such dire moments.Carried by more than twenty students and on-duty teachers, the ropes from Wild Wolf Castle soon arrived. The ropes were all standard reinforced ones purchased from Blackhot City\u2019s military. They were as broad as an adult\u2019s thumb, were resistant to wear and tear, and had a good grip. It was not a problem to use this rope to lift things that were heavier than 2 tons. After tying all the ropes together, it measured to be more than 400 m in length.\u201cThese are the longest ropes that could be bought in Wild Wolf Castle. However, as no one knows how deep these Gold-Eating Boas\u2019 holes are, if we cannot find him even after using all the rope, then we will have to give up!\u201d Zerom looked at Captain Kerlin.Captain Kerlin nodded. \u201cIf it\u2019s as you say, then we can only blame that guy\u2019s bad luck. We will just have to try out best to find him. If we don\u2019t go inside to take a look, it won\u2019t be good for our conscience either.\u201dAfter fastening one end of the rope onto a rock that was as tall as a person and more than 20 meters away from the mouth of the hole, Captain Kerlin and Zerom both tied the other end of the rope on themselves and took a green fluorite bar and jumped into the black hole one after the other\u2026Facing a bottomless hole dug by a Gold-Eating Boa, not even Captain Kerlin and Zerom dared to make a mistake.Seeing them jumping into the hole one after the other, the onlooking students exclaimed\u2026By the time they were 20 meters deep, they could only rely on their fluorite bars. Holding onto the advanced fluorite bar, Zerom gazed at the walls on the interior. At the first turn, Zerom became spirited and pointed at the fresh marks on the wall. Marks created by a hoe could be easily seen among the swirl marks left by the Gold-Eating Boas.\u201cThis is where the hoes have touched. Look here, these marks were made from falling over here. That guy called Zhang Tie really used a hoe to escape. He\u2019s really smart\u2026\u201d After approving of his own deduction, Zerom\u2019s eyes became spirited and he became more interested in Zhang Tie.Captain Kerlin was also extremely excited. He could have never thought that Zhang Tie was not only good at talking, but also really good at escaping.At the sight of the marks left by Zhang Tie using his hoes, the two continued to slide downwards along the rope. On the way, they had seen the marks left by Zhang Tie many times; some were deep, others were shallow, but they were all as fresh as new road marks. Although there were split paths in the hole, they could still find the right direction by using the fresh marks on the walls\u2026People at the mouth of the hole could not clearly see what was happening inside. They could only see the rope gradually disappearing like a strand of noodle in the huge black hole, section by section. 20m, 30m, 50m, 80m, 100m, 120m, 150m, 170m\u2026As the rope fell, the people who stood at the mouth of the hole became increasingly worried for Zhang Tie\u2019s life, as he had fallen to such a depth.Thankfully, the rope finally stopped after falling 190m. After several minutes, as was agreed in advance, Captain Kerlin and Zerom forcefully tugged the rope three consecutive times. Feeling that, the people at the mouth of the hole started to pull the rope together. Compared to the slow descent of the rope, they were pulled up much faster than before, especially because high-level fighters like Captain Kerlin and Zerom were able to easily climb up by stepping on the protrusions on the walls\u2026Several minutes later, before the other end of the rope was pulled out, a long exclamation drifted from within the hollow, followed by Captain Kerlin and Zerom flying out of the hole like two huge birds. The moment Captain Kerlin reached the ground, everybody shot their eyes on the figure bound on Captain Kerlin\u2019s back.\u201cZhang Tie is still alive. He\u2019s just passed out\u2026\u201dHearing Captain Kerlin\u2019s thrilled exclamation, the members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood in the crowd almost jumped, and every onlooker cheered. For everyone present, this really was a miracle. If they hadn\u2019t witnessed it first hand, they would never believe that a person who fell into the jet-black hole would still be alive. That guy was truly more resilient than a cockroach\u2026\u201cPah!\u201d Zerom tossed the corpse of the wild wolf and Zhang Tie\u2019s hoe onto the ground. At the sight of them, the onlookers were really shocked. Not only was that guy more resilient than a cockroach, he seemed to be very strong as well, as he was able to kill three wolves at once \u2026At the sight of that dead wolf that was as soft as a kid\u2019s toy on the ground, Zerom rubbed his chin, realizing that Zhang Tie was even sharper than he had initially thought. Not only did he think of using the hoe to save himself as he fell down the hole, he also thought of using the dead wolf\u2019s body as a cushion to lessen the impact. If it were not for the corpse of the wolf, Zhang Tie would definitely have broken a few bones. Currently, with the exception of a few bruises and wounds on his legs and the other part of his body, there were no other injuries. That was definitely a miracle. It was rare to see such a student\u2026As everyone was cheering, the faces of two people who stood at the edge of the crowd turned pale as they stealthily left when they heard that Zhang Tie was fine.As Zhang Tie had still suffered from some bruises and wounds and was unconscious, Captain Kerlin decided to take Zhang Tie back to Wild Wolf Castle.Everything Captain Kerlin had seen in the hole had given him a favorable impression of Zhang Tie. He realized that if he were the one who jumped into the hole at Zhang Tie\u2019s age, then he would definitely have died. Thankfully, that guy even thought of bringing a hoe with him when he escaped. If it wasn\u2019t for the hoe, which helped him slow down his falling speed, then at the slope 100m deep, all of his bones would most likely have shattered, leaving no complete bone.The moment they brought Zhang Tie out of the hole and declared that he was still alive, Zerom had silently observed the people at the edge of the encompassing crowd. Finally, as the other students cheered, he saw two people silently leave the crowd. Narrowing his eyes, Zerom burned the figures of the two individuals into his mind\u2026\u2026\u2026Half an hour later at a place far away from the location of the incident, Glaze\u2019s group were settled in their mountain cave. Upon hearing Zuhair and Garner\u2019s report, everybody became still like wooden chickens.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that Zhang Tie is still alive? How could that be!? Even if those wild wolves didn\u2019t kill him, he definitely should have died after jumping into that pitch black hole that is several hundred meters in depth! Is he made of iron? How could he still be alive?\u201d Sharon uttered.\u201cEveryone saw Captain Kerlin and Zerom bring Zhang Tie back and place him on the ground. They had tied a rope on themselves and lowered themselves about 200m before they were able to find Zhang Tie and pull him out of there\u2026\u201d As he said this, even Zuhair sighed. \u201cThat fellow\u2019s luck is really too good. How could he have survived from falling in such a deep hole?\u201d\u201cF*ck!\u201d Thinking of the vast amount of effort he had spent to set the trap and the fact that Zhang Tie was still alive, Glaze became infuriated. \u201cZuhair, please tell me, what should I do now? Is there any other way to kill him?\u201dHearing Glaze\u2019s words, Zuhair\u2019s face slightly turned pale. \u201cThis incident has already gotten the attention of the Temporary Supervision Committee. If what we have done is known by the others, we will all be dealt a severe punishment. Not to mention that I feel like Zerom, the guy who was responsible for investigating the scene, has already noticed something amiss. If we were to continue to set up Zhang Tie again, I\u2019m afraid it would too be too risky\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re saying we should call it an end?\u201d Glaze asked with wide opened eyes. Whenever Glaze thought about how he had been set up by Zhang Tie twice, he would always feel as if that was the greatest shame in his entire life.\u201cWe will have to temporarily call it an end. Right now, there\u2019s too much attention on Zhang Tie, not to mention we did this to teach him a lesson. When you reach LV 3 and acquire the recommendation from the school, it still won\u2019t be too late. We will think of a way to deal with him when we return to Blackhot City. If we keep trying now, we will be putting ourselves in great danger!\u201dNo matter how unwilling Glaze was, he had no choice but to agree with Zuhair\u2019s suggestion. \u201cOkay, let him alive a few more days. When we return to Blackhot City, we will think of another way to deal with him\u2026\u201dRealizing that Zhang Tie would not be as easily killed as he thought, Glaze began to feel a little fear towards him.\u201cThankfully, Zhang Tie could never match my strength,\u201d Glaze comforted himself. \u201cDad is right. In the secular world, people are always respected by their strength and fist. If I have an overwhelming strength that can beat him to the point of despair, then I can deal with him with whatever means I want in the future.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Opening his eyes, the first thing Zhang Tie saw was an aged green stone roof. After thinking for a while, he remembered what had happened to him.Wolves\u2026 black hole\u2026 endless rolling inside the hole, and that huge shock that made him lose his consciousness.\u201cAm I still alive?\u201d Zhang Tie pinched his face and felt pain. He then touched all over his body, from his toes to his head, and had found nothing amiss, even his p*nis was completely fine. With the exception of many bruises and wounds, which were not very severe, he was completely fine.\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Sitting on the bed, Zhang Tie burst out into laughter.Hearing his laughter in the quiet house, the door to the room was pushed open as a man fiercely rushed in. \u201cBighead, you\u2019re awake! That\u2019s great! Haha!\u201dThe person who rushed in immediately pressed Zhang Tie back onto the bed, causing Zhang Tie to shriek due to feeling a sharp pain on his shin. \u201cAh! Scumbag, my leg! You\u2019re pressing down on my leg\u2026\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s shriek, Doug hurriedly moved his hand away from Zhang Tie\u2019s leg and stood to the side. Scratching his head like a fool, Doug apologized, \u201cHey, hey, I\u2019m sorry. I forgot that your shin was injured\u2026\u201dWith just a small amount of effort, Zhang Tie\u2019s forehead was already covered in sweat as his face twitched due to the pain. After taking in two deep breaths, he felt much better. \u201cWhere am I? Why am I here?\u201d\u201cWe are in the outer castle of Wild Wolf Castle. That day when you fell into the hole, Captain Kerlin and Mr. Zerom went to get you out of the hole on the same evening. You are really lucky. I heard that 30m deep, there were several long slopes, and there were even some slopes that led people 200m deep in. Only after Captain Kerlin and Zerom went 200m deep were they able to find you. When they found you, you were wounded and in a coma, so they sent you here to receive treatment and to recuperate. Only those who were heavily injured and lost their ability to move could enjoy the treatment you\u2019re receiving right now\u2026\u201d Doug couldn\u2019t help pour out what had happened in the past two days.Only those heavily injured could enjoy such treatment? Zhang Tie looked around, only to find an extremely large room that had more than 10 beds with clean sheets; it seemed like a ward. There was also the smell of disinfectant in this room. Judging from this, Zhang Tie realized that it truly was a ward, one which was occupied by the wounded people in the outer castle of Wild Wolf Castle.\u201cHow long have I been in a coma for?\u201d\u201cIncluding the evening from two days ago and yesterday, you\u2019ve been asleep for two days!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been in a coma for two days?\u201d Zhang Tie was surprised when he heard Doug\u2019s reply. \u201cOh, who\u2019s that Mr. Zerom guy?\u201d\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve been in a coma for two days already. That Zerom fellow is responsible for Second National Male Middle School. You should have an impression of him. He\u2019s skinny, pale, and looks cunning.\u201d As Doug continued to speak, Zhang Tie had already caught sight of a 'skinny, pale guy who looks cunning\u201d entering through the door.Zhang Tie hurriedly signaled Doug with his eyes that someone had entered the room and had even pulled on his clothes in an attempt to signal him; however, as Doug was always stupid in these critical moments, he didn\u2019t understand even a bit of what Zhang Tie was trying to say. Instead, he had even asked:\u201cWhy are you pulling me? I didn\u2019t say anything wrong. I really mean it. That Zerom guy really does look like cunning, and when he smiles, it gives everyone a creepy feeling\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to say that I look cunning, then, I can understand that you\u2019re jealous of my handsome face, but if you\u2019re trying to say I\u2019m cunning, then my only understanding is that you\u2019re trying to slander a member of the Temporary Supervision Committee!\u201d As he said this, Zerom entered the room.Zhang Tie helplessly greeted, \u201cMr. Zerom!\u201dHearing those words, Doug\u2019s face turned pale. After sending Zhang Tie a reprimanding look, he stiffly turned around and staggered, \u201cMr. Ze\u2026 Zerom!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Doug, right? Can you tell me\u2026 when the Andaman Alliance\u2019s wartime decree is active, how are those who slanders the members of the Wartime Management Committee dealt with?\u201d Zerom showed a very cunning smile.Hearing Zerom\u2019s question. Doug\u2019s body trembled all over. If he was holding a winnowing fan, he would have already finished screening the wheat bran[1]. His jaw was shaking so much that his teeth would often hit each other. In times when the Andaman Alliance\u2019s wartime decree was active, anyone who slandered a member of the Wartime Management Committee would be punished with at least being sent behind bars, with the worst punishment being the death penalty.Zhang Tie was also scared to the point where his face turned pale. \u201cMr Zerom, Doug he\u2026\u201dAs he walked towards them, Zerom stopped by Doug and kicked him on the butt, sending him away. \u201cThis is my punishment for you\u2026\u201dDoug, at this moment, became docile. After being kicked, he immediately ran out the door and turned his head towards Zhang Tie as he grimaced before escaping as fast as he could and soon disappeared.Zerom was not a bad person; that was Zhang Tie\u2019s first impression of him. In general, those teachers who would kick their student\u2019s butt as a joke were always not a bad person inside.\u201cThank you, Mr. Zerom. Doug just told me about what had happened after I fell into a coma. I was just about to go and thank you!\u201d Zhang Tie said as he tried getting off the bed.\u201cIt\u2019s fine, you don\u2019t need to move. You still need to rest your leg for another two days. Also, there\u2019s no need to thank me. If too many students die during the survival training, then we teachers will lose face!\u201d Zerom casually moved his hand towards Zhang Tie to stop him from getting off the bed before taking a seat beside Zhang Tie. \u201cThat\u2019s right, that day, how did you decide to jump into that hole to survive? In that scenario, the choice most people would choose would be different than yours. Not to mention that hole was deep. In order to jump into that hole, the amount of courage needed would be no less than facing the seven wolves alone. Since the unknown makes people terrified, that bottomless hole would be terrifying even for people who are stronger than you. Even they would not dare to jump in.\u201dHearing Zerom\u2019s question, Zhang Tie felt a little embarrassed and began to scratch his head as he poured out his thought process during the escape. \u201cI also don\u2019t know why either, but that day when I saw the wolves drill out from the grass and charged at me, that\u2019s what I thought. I knew my only hope of survival was that hole. I knew that my life would be determined in the next 20 seconds. At that time, I knew that if I ran to any other direction, I would have been killed. That\u2019s what I thought, and that\u2019s why I did that. Is there a problem, Mr. Zerom?\u201d\u201cNo, you did pretty well and nobody else could do better than you at that moment\u2026\u201d Zerom was at a loss of words. With a smile, he then said, \u201cEarlier, I was just wondering how you were able to think of such an amazing and precise move in such a short period of time. Now I understand. It seems to be one of your talents, one which allows you to remain calm and make precise decisions in face of danger\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s also considered talent?\u201d Zhang Tie became a little embarrassed, as he assumed that it was related to the marvelous tree. Miss Daina had once said that people\u2019s thoughts also consumed the body\u2019s energy, so in that case, he was able to remain calm and didn\u2019t have any other distracting thoughts because all the distracting thoughts at that moment were routed to that small tree. Zhang Tie was also curious at this moment, as he did not realize that he had this talent before.Certainly, Zerom didn\u2019t know what Zhang Tie was really thinking at this moment. He simply responded to Zhang Tie\u2019s question in a serious matter, \u201cOf course. More than 99% of people in your situation would not be as calm as you. They wouldn\u2019t be able to make such a precise and sharp decision in face of danger. Earlier, Kerlin had said that you were good at escaping. It seems that you truly are the best at escaping\u2026\u201dFacing such weird praise, Zhang Tie could only force a smile. Meanwhile, he remembered that guy who was responsible for collecting mining ores. Did all the guys from Second National Male Middle School learn this weird way of talking from Zerom?\u201cOh, have you ignited your Shrine burning point yet?\u201d\u201cYea, I have ignited it three days ago!\u201dSince what he had done to the wolves had surpassed the limit of any Lv 0 fighter, who would not be able to kill three wolves at once, it was no longer a secret. If he continued to tell a lie at this point, he would just be too foolish. Many great guys have already stood out during the survival training, and even several girls have ignited their Shrine burning point. For Zhang Tie to release the news that he has also ignited his Shrine burning point, it wouldn\u2019t catch too much attention.Sure enough, hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s response, Zerom showed an expression that seemed to say it was expected. Without asking too many questions, he only encouraged Zhang Tie to diligently continue to cultivate before moving on to the next subject.\u201cWolves are a type of very smart animal. A lone wolf might extend to populated areas to hunt preys or just to wander around, but a pack of wolves would rarely be seen here, as it would be very dangerous for them to do so. It\u2019s also possible for a single wolf to be insane, but it\u2019s impossible for a pack of wolves to be insane. In the past decade or so, after the exterminating operation from the guards of Wild Wolf Castle, packs of wild wolves were rarely seen. In the incident that you encountered, there was no other evidence found, so the Temporary Supervision Committee concluded that it was just an unexpected incident. However, you should understand what I\u2019m trying to tell you!\u201d Although Zerom didn\u2019t explicitly say it and only implied it, Zhang Tie was still able to grasp the meaning behind his words.\u201cTeacher, are you trying to say someone set me up?\u201d The look on Zhang Tie\u2019s face changed again.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I said. I only said that this attack was very unnatural, and there might be someone behind it. I like smart students and I have a good impression of you, so I wanted to give you a warning. You should take care of yourself and try not to move alone for the remainder of the survival training!\u201d Zerom straightforwardly put it.\u201cAre there people who could control packs of wolves?\u201d Zhang Tie showed an amazed look.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the sight of Zhang Tie\u2019s amazed look, Zerom only showed a slight smile. \u201cIt\u2019s not difficult to control a pack of wolves. If you can meet an beast tamer or one of the wild guards of the Guardian God School, you will find that it is pretty easy for them to control animals. They could even easily control a pack of wolves and could also determine where they will appear, when they will appear, and which people they will attack. Things like this are not uncommon in this world\u2026\u201d\u2026\u2026After Zerom left, Zhang Tie began to deeply reflect over their conversation. Although his last words were an implication, Zhang Tie realized that he was obviously telling Zhang Tie to be careful. After thinking for quite a while, with the exception of Glaze\u2019s group, he couldn\u2019t think of anyone else who would set him up. Were they the culprits?After Zerom left, Doug stealthily returned again. From Doug\u2019s tone, Zhang Tie realized that the three wolves he had killed made him greatly valuable in the eyes of the others\u2026[1] Winnowing fan was used in processing grains.

Barley exchanged the 100-odd kg of wolf meat for 40 kg of dried rations and 20 kg of dried meat.Wolf meat, fresh wolf meat especially, was very popular among male students. According to the \u201cmarket price\u201d in the square of Wild Wolf Castle, 1 kg of fresh wolf meat could be exchanged for 1 kg of dried rations or 3 kg of dried meat from other people. For those who were able to acquire dried rations and other types of food that were not meat, they were very much willing to do business, as such business could benefit both sides. One side could acquire some fresh meat, while the other side could get dried rations, which could be easily preserved.In addition to food, the three wolf hides could, under the evaluation of Barley, be sold. Although one of the wolf hides was in poor condition, the other two could sell for at least 20 silver coins. With this amount of money, they had half of the total amount needed for Zhang Tie\u2019s circumcision.60 kg of food and 20 silver coins was the \u201cwealth\u201d that Zhang Tie had accidentally acquired almost at the expense of his life. The other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood insisted for Zhang Tie to take it; however, Zhang Tie decided to leave half of the food to be shared among the Hit-Plane Brotherhood. Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s intention, the guys all shook their heads as fast as possible.\u201cBighead, you risked your life to get this food. How could we even be in the mood to eat it\u2026\u201d Barley said.\u201cRight, if we ate it, it won\u2019t bode well for our conscience!\u201d Leit added.\u201cYea, eating it would be like eating your flesh. It would be too miserable!\u201d Doug also replied.Seeing everybody nod, Zhang Tie decided to not talk about food anymore. Additionally, as he had expected, the fact regarding him already having ignited his Shrine burning point didn\u2019t have too much of an effect.After learning that Zhang Tie had ignited his Shrine burning point when he visited Zhang Tie at the hospital, Bagdad ferociously patted Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder before grabbing onto his shoulders and heavily shook him. \u201cThis rascal! I never thought that the first person to ignite their Shrine burning point in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood would be you! It should\u2019ve been me who broke that record. You are truly too excessive. Not only did you ignite your Shrine burning point, but you even hid that fact afterwards!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid the shock would hurt your innocent and fragile souls, making you lose hope to continue living. Look, I did this all for you\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie said in an arrogant and comedic way.\u201cQie!\u201d A row of middle fingers was raised in front of Zhang Tie.\u201cOh right, how did you ignite your Shrine burning point so fast?\u201d Leit asked.\u201cDon\u2019t you know that we Chinese can always ignite the Shrine burning point faster than you?\u201d Many Chinese people could truly ignite their Shrine burning point faster than the other human races. Take Zhang Tie\u2019s dead eldest brother, Zhang Yong, and Zhang Tie\u2019s second brother, Zhang Yang, as an example. They had both ignited their Shrine burning point faster than the people from the other human race. Zhang Tie was born a Chinese, which meant that he could ignite his Shrine burning point faster than the other human races; however, nobody knew that Zhang Tie had ignited his Shrine burning point by depending on Karma Fruit Tree, instead of his talent as a Chinese.Hearing what Zhang Tie said, everyone understood, as they had heard of a saying which said that the Chinese clan was born with innately higher spiritual energy than the other clans in this age.During the time he recuperated in the ward, Zhang Tie was able to enjoy his free time. As he lived in the same ward as two other patients, he felt that there was nothing else to do but to chat with them and walk around Wild Wolf Castle by using a crutch made of a tree branch.At almost the same time as the wolf bit onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shin, Zhang Tie had already stabbed the dagger into the wolf, thus the wolf had only left two medium-sized bite marks which were neither deep nor shallow. Although the wound wasn\u2019t fatal and medicinal ointment had been applied, it would still take him at least a week to recover to his previous state.During this period, Zhang Tie could only act like a cripple. Thankfully, he didn\u2019t need to worry about eating and clothing, as the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood would send him a container full of fish soup every evening, saying it was good for his recovery. Seeing their actions, the two other guys in the ward began to admire him. They especially admired him because of the trap in the stream used to catch fish, which could catch several fish every day regardless of the weather.In that case, Zhang Tie felt very relaxed and felt at ease to recuperate in the castle. Zhang Tie pulled over Barley and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood and inquired about Glaze\u2019s group, yet he didn\u2019t find any special information. With the exception of Glaze still being forbidden to enter Wild Wolf Castle, Zuhair and the other members would occasionally go to Wild Wolf Castle to show off or exchange their prey for other things.The attack of the wild wolves was like Zhang Tie\u2019s bruises and wounds. Aside from leaving a mark on his heart, this incident was soon forgotten by the public.During the survival training, there was a lot of news circulating, as there were many events happening in Wild Wolf Valley every day\u2026After going through this life and death situation, Zhang Tie had become more mature. Although the second Leakless Fruit had already ripened three days ago, Zhang Tie remained calm and didn\u2019t eat it. In fact, he didn\u2019t even spare a glance at the Castle of Black Iron, as he was currently in Wild Wolf Castle, making it inconvenient for him to move. Before the survival training had even started, he had considered the Castle of Black Iron to be something extremely important to him; however, after experiencing that life and death situation, the importance he attached to the Castle of Black Iron was not as much as he previously attached. He began to realize that there were many other things that were more important than the Castle of Black Iron. Sunshine, for example, was something that he learned the value of after having entered that pitch black hole. Without sunshine, plants would not be able to grow; without plants, animals would not be able to survive; and without animals and plants, human beings would not be able to survive either.Although sunshine was precious and represented hope and life, it was still free.Air was very precious, without which people would soon die within a couple minutes, yet air was free.Water was very precious, without which most living beings would not be able to live on, yet water was also free in the wild.Family bonds were precious; in fact, it was the most precious thing in the world, yet that was also free, as many people had been born with it.Friendship was very precious and could spice up your life, making life more substantial, yet friendship was also free.Love was very precious. As Hista had told him, love was the most beautiful thing in the world. The moment of ecstasy as a man and a woman seduced each other in order to make love was truly beautiful. As Zhang Tie had never done such a thing, he could only temporarily trust Hista.Life was also the most precious thing in the world, and yet it was something given to him by his parents for free.Zhang Tie realized that many things that could be bought were not too precious, while things that were truly precious could never be bought with money. Many people had ignored the precious things in their lives and were instead pursuing the things that could be bought with money. Once they found what was truly precious in their daily lives, they could truly be considered \u201crich\u201d. Understanding this, Zhang Tie\u2019s view of the world instantly expanded.Every morning, after waking up, he would wash his face and brush his teeth. Afterwards, he could climb atop a small hill with the help of his crutch. Standing atop that small hill, he would inhale the fresh air as he did some simple exercises, pleasantly waiting for the first rays of sunshine to shine upon him. The feeling of being bathed in the first rays of sunshine brought people an euphoric sensation.After welcoming the arrival of the first rays of sunshine, Zhang Tie returned using the crutch. He would casually bring some food and pick up some common rocks on the road before using them to occupy a small booth outside the gate of Wild Wolf Castle. Sitting in front of the booth, he would watch the beauties enter and leave the castle. Zhang Tie had discovered that there was a benefit of watching the beauties; it would speed up the circulation of his blood, which was beneficial to his recovery.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was good for my recovery\u2014Zhang Tie found himself a shameless excuse. Using this shameless excuse, every time he watched the beauties, he would end up using his \u201cRight Hand Shame Covering Technique\u201d as he put his right hand into his trouser pocket and pushed down on his restless p*nis while awkwardly escaping.After watching the beauties, Zhang Tie would casually eat some lunch before having a luxurious nap. Upon waking up through the help of his biological clock, he would wander about the square filled with vitality and would look for Pandora in order to exchange for some wild fruits, which would be his snacks. With wild fruits in his mouth, he would visit the iron smelting workshop in Wild Wolf Castle to learn about craftsmanship and smelting iron and would watch the fellows there complete assembling a set of steam engines in the simple workshop.For using charcoals to melt iron, the biggest problem was that the temperature of the burning charcoal was not high enough to melt iron ores in the crucible, and without sufficient heat, it would not be possible to obtain steel. Block iron smelting was commonly used. After mixing the iron ores and the charcoal together in the iron melting kiln, they would repetitively temper the iron blocks and push out the impurities from within. Due to the low amount of carbon content, wrought iron was soft and could not be directly used to be processed into tools without being carburized[1], which would allow them to obtain low-carbon steel. Although Zhang Tie had learned this knowledge at school, he still needed some time to proficiently put them into practice. These days, he had already been familiar with the group of craftsmen in the iron melting workshop. Sometimes, he even went there to help them wave the bar, which would blow air and thus making the fire more ferocious, or brought them some fruits in exchange for learning something. After a few days of learning, Zhang Tie found that he was now able to proficiently smelt iron and knew how to completely carburize wrought iron. This could be considered an accidental achievement!For the past few days, as he was recuperating, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know that his survival from the attack of the wolves had left a good impression on Captain Kerlin, who was planning to give a truly good reward![1] Adding carbon to iron or steel to toughen the materialPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every two days, Captain Kerlin would visit Zhang Tie and would drop off a small packet of medicinal powder, which was to be applied to his wounds. Unknown whether it was the effect of the powder or the small tree in the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie discovered that the recovery of the wounds on his legs was truly fast. By the second time he applied the medicinal powder to his wounds, Zhang Tie already did not need to use a crutch to walk. Six days later, when he applied the medicinal powder for the third time, Zhang Tie was already able to run.During Captain Kerlin\u2019s third visit of bringing the medicinal powder, at the sight of the one-eyed man nodding as he squatted down to inspect the wounds on his legs, Zhang Tie knew that the number of days left in his vacation in Wild Wolf Castle was few. These past few days, Zhang Tie realized that the one-eyed man had been kinder to him. Sometimes, he would even casually chat with Zhang Tie, causing Zhang Tie to feel extremely flattered.\u201cAfter you apply the medicine on your wounds this time, you should be fine and can leave Wild Wolf Castle tomorrow. Don\u2019t even think about pretending to be sick to stay here. You\u2019re rather resilient, so if you pay a bit of attention and protect the wounds, then they will only scar!\u201d\u201cHmm, I know\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie sincerely looked at Captain Kerlin. \u201cCaptain Kerlin, I really have to thank you for taking care of me during this time. There\u2019s an old Chinese saying\u2014if you are given a drop of water, then you will repay with a spring. You have saved my life this time. This is something that I will definitely never forget!\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, Captain Kerlin slightly became stunned before showing a smile. \u201cBoy, how do you think you could help me in your present condition? A LV 1 fighter like you is barely qualified to join the lowest level cannon fodder camps!\u201d\u201cAlthough I am not able to help now, but that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t in the future. Humans strive to keep improving themselves, step by step!\u201d Zhang Tie calmly explained.\u201cGood, you have ambition!\u201d Captain Kerlin encouraged him, \u201cThe \u2018escape\u2019 theory you explained in class gave me a good impression of you, but never would I have thought that you were this good at escaping. However, you can\u2019t always just escape. There will be many situations where you would have no choice but to fight. When faced with such a situation, you need real force and real combat capabilities to be able to survive. Suppose the pikemen matrix you\u2019re in was faced with a LV 4 pikemen matrix. At the order of your commander, you would have to charge forward at that matrix, as you have to follow military regulation and the fighting supervision squad was behind you. With your current capabilities, your only option would be to charge forward as cannon fodder, buying time for your commander to think of his plans and deployment. In such a scenario, do you think you could escape?\u201dZhang Tie kept silent for a while before dejectedly answering, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t!\u201d\u201cSo, even if you were able to escape a hundred times, as long as you encounter this scenario, you will definitely die. As a man, as a fighter, you should not be using your abilities to avoid the enemy\u2014instead, you should have your abilities to destroy them! If you want to become useful in the future, your current strength is not enough. You will have to further cultivate\u2026\u201d As Captain Kerlin said this, he pulled a book out from his clothes and casually threw it into Zhang Tie\u2019s hand. \u201cI obtained this book from a battlefield before. Although it\u2019s not very precious, it\u2019s not ordinary either. At the very least, it\u2019s better than the fighting skills you have learned at school and the ones you would learn in the alliance\u2019s military. This will be my present to you. It will be up to you whether or not you can master it!\u201dZhang Tie looked in amazement at the name of the book\u2014Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The paper was both water resistant and fire resistant and was coated in silver. Zhang Tie knew that silver coated paper was extremely expensive. Only a few very important classical or sacred books would be recorded on silver coated paper. However, as silver coated papers could not be printed, people had to use a special pen and ink in order to leave marks on the paper, thus all books or texts made using silver coated paper, including the book containing theBefore leaving the ward, Zhang Tie went to the office of the Temporary Supervision Committee to deal with the relevant departure procedures. He then went to bid farewell to Captain Kerlin and Zerom. Unfortunately, the two had already gone out for a routine inspection early in the morning, thus he had no choice but to leave.During the survival training, teachers and coaches both had their own responsibilities. For teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee, they were responsible for sweeping magical beasts and mutated living beings that could endanger the lives of the students in Wild Wolf Valley. Therefore, it became their daily job to make routine inspections over Wild Wolf Valley. For many of the teachers, with such an easy job, it was as if they were out for vacation.After being told that Captain Kerlin and Mr. Zerom had left, Zhang Tie bid farewell to the guys in the iron smelting workshop whom he had gotten familiar with in the past few days. Afterwards, Zhang Tie walked out of Wild Wolf Castle.The square of Wild Wolf Castle was already teeming with people at noon. Coincidentally, Zhang Tie saw Pandora once again among the crowd. Pandora had always set her booth in a corner that was not particularly eye-catching. Sitting in a corner, that thin and small girl would hide in the corner as she hugged her knees.It was only when Zhang Tie had arrived before Pandora\u2019s booth did the girl with a thin and small frame raise her head and look at Zhang Tie. \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. I wasn\u2019t able to pick any fruits today\u2026\u201dIn front of Pandora was a small pile of ordinary, wild vegetables. Looking at Pandora, Zhang Tie realized that her clothes were soaked from the morning dew and realized that she must have gone foraging for wild vegetables and fruits early in the morning. However, during the survival training, many people would choose to forage for wild vegetables and fruits, thus making them harder to find due to lower quantity. Since this was the case, objectively speaking, the girls were forced to team up with boys to finish the survival training. After all, humans lived in groups. As an individual, unless they were exceptionally powerful, it would be difficult to survive in the wild.The pitiful look of that petite girl slightly shocked Zhang Tie\u2026\u201cAh, my wounds are not that serious anymore and I can now freely move. I will be leaving today, so before leaving, I came to say goodbye! Zhang Tie felt bashful as he scratched his head.\u201cOh, I hope you recover soon!\u201d Pandora smiled. This was the first time Zhang Tie had seen her smile. With her pair of beautiful blue eyes, she looked pretty nice when she smiled. As he gave Pandora a second look, Zhang Tie mumbled inside, \u201cHmm, with the exception of her thin and petite figure and the freckles on her face, Pandora is still very beautiful.\u201d\u201cAre you free tonight?\u201d Zhang Tie suddenly asked.\u201cWhat for?\u201d Hearing his words, Pandora suddenly became alert as she hid her chest behind her knees.\u201cI\u2026 wanted to invite you to dinner at our tree base. I realized that you always forage for food by yourself, so if you haven\u2019t joined any team yet, then I wish to sincerely invite you to join us. We have seven male students, all of which are nice guys!\u201d\u201cAre you inviting me to be your partner during the survival training?\u201d Pandora\u2019s eyes started to shine; however, they soon became depressed once again. \u201cNo\u2026 I can\u2019t agree!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhang Tie was startled.\u201cThey said that anyone who\u2019s with me will suffer misfortune. I don\u2019t want to bring you troubles. Last time, right after you bought my wild fruits, you were forced to jump into a hole by wolves,\u201d Pandora dejectedly said.\u201cNonsense. How could I blame you for that!? Look at me, aren\u2019t I perfectly fine?\u201d As he said this, Zhang Tie flexed his muscle in a manner akin to bodybuilders in order to show off the muscles on his arms, causing Pandora to bashfully chuckle.\u201cYou really don\u2019t care?\u201d\u201cOf course not. Don\u2019t listen to what they\u2019re saying. I even see you as my lucky angel. If it weren\u2019t for you, I might have already starved to death\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie loudly shouted.\u201cThen\u2026 okay!\u201d Pandora finally agreed after thinking for a while.Receiving Pandora\u2019s consent, Zhang Tie heaved a sigh of relief inside. Since this was the first time he had invited a girl, if he were to have been refused, then he would really feel like he had lost face. In regards to the attack from the wild wolves, Mr. Zerom had already implied that Zhang Tie might have been set up by someone, so how could he blame Pandora for that incident?. Besides, when Zhang Tie was very young, his mom had told him never to blame others for your own bad luck. A man should be committed. Zhang Tie had always kept that sincere guidance deep in his mind.\u201cThen, it\u2019s a set! In the afternoon, I will come here to pick you up. Our tree house is very interesting, and we all live inside tree hollows. We will also have fish soup to drink tonight\u2026\u201d\u201cLiving in tree hollows?\u201d Pandora slightly raised her face, which contained an expression of longing. At the sight of Pandora\u2019s curious expression, Zhang Tie immediately affirmed that fish soup and tree houses were both attractive to girls.\u201cOh, right\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie took out of several pieces of dried rations and dried meat from his bag and put away all the wild vegetables that had been wrapped with clean tree leaves by Pandora. \u201cI want all the wild vegetables!\u201dThe dried rations and dried meat given by Zhang Tie to Pandora was excessively greater than the value of the wild vegetables, causing Pandora to get up hurriedly. \u201cIt\u2019s too much, I don\u2019t need that much\u2026\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s ok. The extra can be considered your free lunch\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie smiled and waved his hands towards Pandora before he strode out of the square\u2026Looking at Zhang Tie\u2019s shadow, the girl slightly narrowed her eyes as she mumbled, \u201cCould I really be someone\u2019s lucky angel?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026TL/ED Notes:[1] Think of it as like a wooden stake.

What happened to Zhang Tie reminded everybody of the potential dangers. After all, such an incident could also happen to others. None of the horny students wanted to encounter a pack of wolves alone when they were accompanying girls back to Wild Wolf Castle, thus they all exerted their utmost efforts to clear out the wild wolves. During this process, they had truly encountered several lone wolves; however, they were unable to find the other four wolves who had attacked Zhang Tie that day.On the way back to the tree base, especially when he passed by that grassland, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but recall the incident that had happened to him that day and the furious gazes of the wolves that were fixed on him. The eternal hatred in their eyes made Zhang Tie feel that he might encounter the four wild wolves once again.Currently, it was noon, and only Bagdad was left on-duty at the tree base. Returning to the tree base, Zhang Tie saw Bagdad and his bare arms. In his hands was a spear, which he used to practice a thrusting movement. The moment Zhang Tie came close to the tree base, he had already been noticed by Bagdad.\u201cWho?\u201d Covered in sweat, Bagdad turned around with the spear in hand.\u201cWorking hard, youth! I wonder if you were stimulated by me, who has already ignited my Shrine burning point!?\u201d Zhang Tie walked over with a smile.Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s face, Bagdad, who was surprised at Zhang Tie\u2019s return, instantly froze. As his face twitched, Bagdad cursed, \u201cB*stard!\u201d At the same time, dropping his spear, he walked towards Zhang Tie and fiercely embraced him. \u201cDon\u2019t get arrogant. I will surpass you sooner or later!\u201d\u201cBagdad, did you know? I have always had a big secret, but I do not have the heart to tell you!\u201d Zhang Tie said with a serious expression.Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, as expected, Bagdad asked, \u201cWhat secret?\u201d\u201cThe secret is\u2026 in fact, I am actually a genius among geniuses\u2026\u201d When Zhang Tie replied, his solemn look turned into an obscene smile, one which made Bagdad really want to beat him. \u201cIn the past, I just wanted to experience the life of you mortals, so in order to not make you feel bad, I have controlled my brilliance and have only shown 5% of my power. After this incident, I have decided to exert my utmost efforts to cultivate, which means that it would be next to impossible for you to surpass me from now on. I suggest you to choose a different target, as it is truly unfortunate for you, a mortal, to treat me as your target!\u201d\u201cArgh, you b*stard\u2026\u201d Realizing that he had been played by Zhang Tie, Bagdad wrapped his arm around Zhang Tie\u2019s neck, almost causing him to suffocate\u2026\u2026\u2026As expected, returning to the tree base, when Barley and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood caught sight of Zhang Tie, they became extremely excited. Although they were not able to achieve too much today and were unable to catch any large preys using the big pits they had dug, using the small traps taught by Zhang Tie, which were made of stones and twigs, they were able to catch two pheasants. Additionally, they got more than ten palm-sized fish from the trap near the stream. Together with the wild vegetables that Zhang Tie had brought, they would be able to enjoy a filling supper tonight.As dusk fell, Zhang Tie told them that he would invite a girl for supper. Under the whistles of the horny students, Zhang Tie went to pick up Pandora and brought her back to their tree base. As this was the first time she had been invited for supper by male students, Pandora looked somewhat stiff; however, after seeing the horny students laugh and joke around, she gradually became relaxed.After supper, Zhang Tie invited Pandora to take a look at their tree base. Afterwards, Zhang Tie, Bagdad, and Sharwin went together to send Pandora back to Wild Wolf Castle. At the sight of the corner of Pandora\u2019s mouth having been raised, Zhang Tie knew that both his invitation and the supper was a success. it seemed that inviting girls wasn\u2019t particularly hard.When they returned to the tree base, a bonfire had been lit under the Dragon-Claw Tree. Barley and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood were bragging as they sat under the tree and were talking about Pandora.\u201cAlthough her breasts and frame aren\u2019t fully developed, she still has a nice face. Bighead really has a strange taste in women!\u201d Leit said.\u201cMaybe this kind of girl can easily arouse Bighead\u2019s desire to sleep with her. I have heard that there are many impotent men in their thirties who like this kind of girl since they are easily convinced. Hahaha\u2026\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you noticed that Pandora has a pair of watery eyes? According to my observations, all women with beautiful eyes are good at pleasing men\u2026\u201d Hista obscenely said.\u201cEven Bighead has a girlfriend. We have to work hard too. I remember that there were many beautiful girls among the group of girls that we invited last time. We can have a try tomorrow\u2026\u201dWhen it came to girls, the horny students all became thrilled. Seeing Zhang Tie and the other two members return, they moved aside and let them in before continuing with the topic. Under their persistence, Zhang Tie honestly poured out how he had gotten to know Pandora. Although Zhang Tie had claimed repetitively that he didn\u2019t have any evil thoughts about Pandora and had only invited her as a friend to join their team to pass through the survival training, nobody believed him. They simply responded with jeers and doubtful eyes.\u201cYou don\u2019t have any evil intentions about her because you\u2019re not circumcised. Not to mention that you\u2019re forbidden to stay alone with girls. Heh heh\u2026 If it weren\u2019t for these two obstacles, you would have already shown your evil nature!\u201d\u201cI know you\u2019re planning to sleep with her when you return to Blackhot City. That\u2019s truly a good idea. You have really thought this through. Since that small girl isn\u2019t that attractive and is cautious, you will first get acquainted with her. Once you get acquainted with her, you won\u2019t have to worry about her being snatched by others!\u201d\u201cTwo months later, Pandora will develop a bit more, right?\u201d\u201cShe should be sexier by then. Girls nowadays develop faster and mature earlier than before!\u201d\u201cRight now, her breasts are truly on the smaller side, so you plan to get acquainted with her first. Later, you won\u2019t have to worry about not having a chance to sleep with her\u2026\u201d\u201cHeh\u2026 heh\u2026\u201d\u201cThese animals!\u201d Zhang Tie cursed inside. In order to protect his ears and his innocent soul from being polluted by those dirty words, Zhang Tie decided to change the topic.

He was curious about what else surprise the small tree could bring him\u2026While Zhang Tie was pleasantly thinking about it, the images of Glaze and his lackeys appeared in his mind followed by an image of Captain Kerlin. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t know why, but when he recalled Captain Kerlin\u2019s face these days, he could sense a hint of depression\u2026 Could it be his imagination?

At noon, I will just casually eat a bit when I\u2019m out,\u201d Zhang Tie replied as he hurriedly put the mining basket on his back.\u201cHow about I go mining for you? All of my achievements will belong to you. I swear that the amount will not be less than one ton of ores a day\u2026\u201d Bagdad patted his chest, causing \u201cPa Pa\u201d sounds.\u201cReally, there\u2019s no need! Mining is my hobby. For the time being, I still find it to be interesting!\u201d Zhang Tie had also refused Bagdad. Seeing their pitiful looks, Zhang Tie felt that he needed to show them a bit of hope.

If we fail to capture one with our existing traps, then we will dig another one today\u2026\u201dLeaving one person to keep watch of the tree base, all the other horny students moved on and became a hundred times more active than Zhang Tie. At the sight of these guys, who were acting kind in front of him earlier, leaving him alone, Zhang Tie shook his head and inwardly heaved a deep sigh. It seems the power of theSeeing them disappear before him with an extremely quick speed, Zhang Tie smiled. Afterwards, he suddenly had a weird premonition. It seems that the Castle of Black Iron would bring him a surprise today.\u2026\u2026Half an hour later, with a burning torch in hand, Zhang Tie entered that tunnel where he used to dig in the mine. First, he set up a small trap at the mouth of the tunnel that would warn him if someone entered the tunnel. Afterwards, Zhang Tie removed his mining basket and inserted the torch into a gap between two rocks. Walking into the shadow of another tunnel where the light did not reach, he took in a deep breath and closed his eyes. There appeared the arched door in his mind\u2014lock on\u2026 enter!\u2014\u2014\u201cHandsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!\u201dAs it was 'sunny and brilliant\u201d in the Castle of Black Iron, Zhang Tie narrowed his eyes, and after a short while, he gradually began to adapt to the sunlight. All the light here radiated from the colorful fog that flowed around the surrounding space. The light was soft; it was as if the light had shone through a rainbow or the rays of the sun before shining down, giving Zhang Tie a comfortable feeling. Zhang Tie once wondered whether there were night and day in the Castle of Black Iron and whether it remained the same even after he left; however, he soon gave up this thought.Upon stepping on the firm land in the Castle of Black Iron once again, complicated feelings burst forth in Zhang Tie. Due to the attack from the seven wild wolves that almost took his life and had almost forced him to bid farewell to the world forever, Zhang Tie felt as if he had been reborn.Through this crisis, Zhang Tie felt again that strength was very important in this age.After taking in a deep breath of fresh, aura-filled air, Zhang Tie leisurely opened the basic attributes panel of the Castle of Black Iron.\u2014\u2014Castle of Black Iron\u2014\u2014Length: Krosa\u2014\u2014Width: 1 Krosa\u2014\u2014Aura value: 3968\u2014\u2014Merit value: 2117\u2014\u2014Basic energy storage: 4285\u2014\u2014Special output: voidWith the increasing number of plants within the Castle of Black Iron, the aura value had presently skyrocketed over the past two weeks. At the sight of the quickly increasing numbers, Zhang Tie became very excited.The moment he closed the basic attributes panel, a dialogue jumped out automatically.\u2014\u2014The liquid yeast has completed its mutation and evolution for the first time. Please view the changes!Soon after the dialogue disappeared, Zhang Tie recalled that he had used several points of basic energy storage on the liquid yeast before the start of the survival training, which would complete its mutation and evolution after 15 days. Therefore, Zhang Tie hurriedly opened the \u201cMicroorganisms\u201d management panel in \u201cCarbon-based Living Beings and Species Management\u201d under the \u201cLiving Beings and Population Management\u201d to check the results of the mutation and evolution.Two messages instantly popped out\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014No new liquid yeast variant was formed through the mutation and evolution, thus the mutation and evolution has failed!\u2014\u2014If you wish to attempt to mutate and evolve the liquid yeast again, the system suggests you to increase the amount of basic energy storage points!Thinking of how he had inputted 0.1 basic energy storage points into the liquid yeast last time, Zhang Tie felt embarrassed. After thinking for a while, Zhang Tie attempted for a second time to mutate and evolve the liquid yeast. This time, Zhang Tie decided that he will definitely succeed. Aside from using the maximum amount of basic energy storage possible, Zhang Tie also increased the amount of merit value points by ten-fold and doubled the amount of aura value points.After a series of steps, two dialogues popped out again\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014On June 13rd, 889th year of the Black Iron Calendar, Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord had inputted 600 points of aura value, 50 points of merit value, and 340 points of basic energy storage into the mutation and evolution of a bottle of liquid yeast.\u2014\u2014It is estimated that the mutation and evolution will take 360 hours. Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, please wait patiently!Since the surprise didn\u2019t come from the mutation and evolution of the bottle of liquid yeast, then it could only come from the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree.Moving towards the small tree, before he had even been able to stand before it, he had already smelt an unforgettable fragrance; the fragrance was a mix of the Leakless Fruit and a fragrance that contained both the smell of sandalwood and fruits. However, this time, the fragrance coming from the Leakless Fruit contained something special.As expected, the tree brought Zhang Tie a huge surprise\u2014\u2014On the twig where the first Leakless Fruit had once grown were two Leakless Fruits. Judging from its color, one of the two fruits had already become ripe, while the other one would ripen soon. At the sight of the two hanging Leakless Fruits, Zhang Tie finally recovered his composure. Previously, whether a ripe Leakless Fruit would fall off the tree or whether it would delay the growth of the next Leakless Fruit had always been a concern of Zhang Tie\u2019s. However, at the sight of the two Leakless Fruit hanging closely, Zhang Tie felt at ease.\u2014\u2014This Leakless Fruit has become ripe. Usage: Pick and direct eat it. Notice: The fruit cannot be taken out of the Castle of Black Iron. After twelve hours of having been picked off the tree, its energy and vitality will gradually decline.\u2014\u201431 hours left before this Leakless Fruit becomes ripe!Zhang Tie read the above two warnings regarding the two hanging Leakless Fruits.Looking at the two Leakless Fruits, Zhang Tie felt really happy. Beside the Leakless Fruit, Zhang Tie found the Iron Body Fruit, though it looked different than last time. He then checked its progress bar; upon finding that it was three-quarters ripe, Zhang Tie burst into laughter. At the sight of the progress bar, Zhang Tie remembered his tumbles within the deep hole dug by the Gold-Eating Boas. Never would he have that the collisions and friction from the tumbles would have such a marvelous effect. It was almost the same as him being beaten! It seemed that he didn\u2019t necessarily need to find people to beat him. As long as he received damage to his body, it would stimulate the growth of the Iron-Body Fruit. With this, this gave Zhang Tie many new ideas, causing the road before him to become much broader than before.However, the biggest surprise was neither the Leakless Fruits nor the Iron Body Fruit; instead, it was the strange fruit that hung on the other side of the tree. Ever since his last encounter with Huck and Snade, Zhang Tie realized that this small tree could produce fruits even without his consent. With external stimulation, the tree would be able to produce fruits. Since that incident, Zhang Tie had made it a habit to circle around the small tree to check whether new fruits were hanging somewhere.There really was a strange, hexagonal pitch-black fruit that was the size of a plum.Stretching out his hand, Zhang Tie instantly got its information.\u2014\u2014The Trouble-Reappearance Fruit has already become ripe. Usage: Pick and direct eat it. Notice: The fruit cannot be taken out of the Castle of Black Iron. After twelve hours of having been picked off the tree, its energy and vitality will gradually decline.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe moment the above words disappeared, another paragraph of words appeared.\u2026\u2026\u2014\u2014This is the fruit of killing.

After taking in a few deep breaths, Zhang Tie finally managed to control his desire to pluck off the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit and instead moved to the other side of the tree before promptly picking off the ripened Leakless Fruit and consuming it in a couple of bites. Following that, he sat under the tree with legs crossed in order to experience the effect from the second ripened Leakless Fruit.Because of Huck and Snade and because of the damned wolves, he was delayed by roughly three weeks from enjoying the ripe Leakless Fruit.It truly wasn\u2019t easy! Zhang Tie heaved a deep sigh inside before closing his eyes and immersing himself in the gradual, obvious effects of the second, ripe Leakless Fruit.Before the lingering fragrance from the sweet juice of the second, ripe Leakless Fruit had even disappeared, a familiar sensation could be felt; a strand of hot air could be felt in his chest and continued to swirl upwards. Then, the strand of hot air became a hot wave that turned into a ferocious fire dragon, directly charging towards the burning point on his rear end. The ferocious fire dragon gradually became increasingly more powerful while the red flame by the burning point at his rear end immediately grew brighter; it was as if it was a pile of burning firewood that had just been doused with oil. \u201cBoom!\u201d The red flame turned into a dark orange color. As the energy gradually seeped into the flame, the dark orange color also gradually became brighter\u2026Zhang Tie had sat there for almost half an hour, during which his body shook slightly three times. Half an hour later when Zhang Tie opened his eyes, his eyes were filled with uncontrollable passion. After a short while, in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind, he could already catch a glimpse at the brilliant yellow flame over the burning point by his rear end. With a single ripe Leakless Fruit, he had consecutively broken through three cultivation barriers on the burning point\u2014truly an astonishing speed and force! Seeing that silent small tree beside him once again, Zhang Tie\u2019s heart was filled with awe.After stretching his limbs and his body, Zhang Tie came before that Trouble-Reappearance Fruit once again.\u201cI wonder what this fruit is used for?\u201dWith this question, Zhang Tie carefully plucked the fruit, sat down with crossed legs, and took a large bite.Compared to the Leakless Fruit, which had a sweet taste, the moment he had bitten into the flesh of the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit, it was as if he had bitten into smoke-like water which flowed from his mouth through the place which connected his oral cavity and his navel passage and directly rushed towards his brain. When the energy from the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit encountered the small swirl of foggy and golden Qi in his mind, Zhang Tie felt as if someone was fiercely striking a drum within his mind. All of a sudden, the view before his eyes turned pitch black and he entered a space where light could not reach.This was a strange feeling. Although Zhang Tie\u2019s body was obviously sitting under the Manjusaka Karma Fruit Tree, it seemed as if his spirit was in another space, one which even light could not reach.Soon after he entered that space, he saw a dim light which gradually became brighter and changed into a hexagon-shaped door, one whose shape resembled the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit. Zhang Tie didn\u2019t move, as that hexagon-shaped door was directly rushing towards him like a train. Surprisingly, right when it was about to collide with Zhang Tie, it enveloped him. Then, Zhang Tie found himself in a place that truly caused him to be extremely shocked\u2026It was the familiar path that he walked on when he returned from the mine!The familiar uphill road!The familiar grassland!When the breeze came, even the way the grass swayed was the same.Zhang Tie could even hear the \u201cSha Sha\u201d sounds that came when the breeze blew over the grass while the familiar chirping of insects reverberated into his ears from the side of the road. As the afterglow from the setting sun gradually painted the Wild Wolf Valley in a golden color, every pore on Zhang Tie\u2019s body could feel that a kind of warmth filled the air\u2026\u201cWhat\u2019s happening? How could I be here? This feeling\u2026 why is it so familiar?\u201d Zhang Tie panicked a bit when he realized he was carrying a mining basket on his back.However, Zhang Tie was not given too much time to think about what had happened. While Zhang Tie was panicking, several \u201crocks\u201d in the patch of grass beside him were speeding towards Zhang Tie. In a couple of seconds, three wolves had drilled their way out from the grass.With eyes fixed on Zhang Tie, even a fool would be able to sense the hatred contained in their eyes. As they grinned, \u201cGulu Gulu\u201d sounds came from their throats in the exact same manner as what Zhang Tie had encountered several days ago. The only difference was that there were only three wolves this time, instead of seven. Additionally, the three wolves were exactly the ones that had been killed by him. Zhang Tie remembered that one of the three wolves had a ring of white fur right above its neck, just like one of the three wolves before him.\u201cF*ck, what\u2019s happening?\u201d Zhang Tie was really frightened, and the scene was too much for him, causing his mind to be thrown into chaos. Before he was able to clear his mind, the three wolves had already pounced towards him.Zhang Tie hurriedly put down his mining basket, but the leader of the three wolves, the fastest one, had already knocked him down onto the ground. Its sharp claws had already pierced through Zhang Tie\u2019s chest, causing him to feel so much pain that he began to growl.Panicking, Zhang Tie remembered the dagger that hung on his waist. After fiercely punching the wolf that had pounced on his body, Zhang Tie intended to grab that dagger; however, another wolf had already arrived and had bitten his wrist. The moment its sharp canines pierced through his flesh, Zhang Tie was in so much pain that he almost passed out. The blood vessels at his wrist had also been roughly torn by the wolf, causing his fresh blood to instantly spray out.At that moment, Zhang Tie\u2019s mind was filled with the fear of death and the excruciating pain that was present all over his body. Soon after, the third wild wolf reached him and started to bite Zhang Tie\u2019s right leg. Feeling the pain, Zhang Tie miserably screamed out, \u201cAh, help!\u201dHowever, his high-pitched screams didn\u2019t work at all. What was worse, the leader of the wolves that had been pushed away by him earlier had shown its canines again as it bit down on Zhang Tie\u2019s neck. As a result, Zhang Tie wrestled with the three wild wolves; however, his final struggles were all in vain.At the last minute when he lost his consciousness, Zhang Tie no longer felt pain; instead, he felt a suffocating sensation, as his blood had filled his air pipes and lungs after his neck and throat were torn apart by the leader of the wolves.\u201cIs this what death feels like?\u201d This was the last strand of his consciousness\u2026Boom\u2026Everything broke into fragmented specks of lights before vanishing!Under the small tree, Zhang Tie recovered his senses and opened his eyes, recalling what he had just experienced just now. As his chest heaved up and down, Zhang Tie continued to gasp for air. It was only now did Zhang Tie realized how nice it was to be able to breathe for free. Feeling cold all over, he touched his back only to find that it had been covered in cold sweat. If he had a mirror to look into at this moment, he was sure that his face would definitely be pale. Checking all over his body, he wasn\u2019t able to find any wounds at all. What had happened just now was like a dream; however, the dream was extremely realistic. With the exception of not having actually lost his life and not having been injured, what had just happened to him was definitely real. \u201cHow could that happen?\u201d Zhang Tie started to rack his brain. \u201cIt must be the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit.\u201d When he thought of the information about the fruit, Zhang Tie suddenly realized something.Zhang Tie\u2019s temperament was actually on the persistent and stubborn side. If what had just happened to him was truly related to the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit, then Zhang Tie wouldn\u2019t let this go until he has figured it out. After recovering his composure through half an hour of rest, he clenched his teeth and sat down under the tree with legs crossed once again.\u201cDamn it, I swear I\u2019ll figure this out!\u201d Zhang Tie fiercely mumbled. \u201cIf I can\u2019t figure this out, then I won\u2019t eat supper and neither will I get circumcised in the future! I\u2019ll be a virgin for the rest of my life !\u201dWith this persistence, Zhang Tie entered his mind once again.It was different than before; Zhang Tie had found something besides the arched door of the Castle of Black Iron. Floating above the arched door like a looming star was the hexagon-shaped Trouble-Reappearance Fruit that he had eaten earlier.Focusing on the hexagon-shaped star, a message came to his mind.\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, because you have already used the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit once, if you wish to use it again, you must inject enough spiritual energy before you can activate the effect of the Trouble-Reappearance Scene within the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit.Since the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit was in his mind, Zhang Tie was easily able to quickly inject spiritual energy into it. This hexagon-shaped fruit was like a sponge, as it continued to absorb his spiritual energy. After three minutes of absorption, the fruit became shiny once again.\u2014\u2014The Trouble-Reappearance Fruit has been activated and is now available to be used again! The method to use the fruit is the same as the one used to access the Castle of Black Iron.\u201cThe same as accessing the Castle of Black Iron? Heh heh, that will be simple\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie mumbled.Lock on\u2014\u2014Enter\u2026At the beginning, it was still pitch black inside; however, soon after, sparkles appeared in the darkness before finally forming into a hexagon-shaped door which rushed towards Zhang Tie like a train, forcing Zhang Tie to enter. Afterwards, Zhang Tie reappeared on that path, facing the grass that swayed from the breeze. Everything from before had remained unchanged.\u201cIs this the effect of Trouble-Reappearance Fruit? Does it recreate killing scenes to allow me to become liberated through killing and death?Zhang Tie looked towards the patch of grass, within which three \u201crocks\u201d had already started to move towards him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euF*ck! Since he didn\u2019t want to suffer the pain from the three wolves again, Zhang Tie hurriedly put down his mining basket and pulled out the dagger from his waist before taking a defensive posture. With eyes widely opened, Zhang Tie stared at the three wild wolves, who had their eyes brimming with hatred fixed on him\u2026The wild wolves charged at Zhang Tie as he waved his dagger\u2026Five minutes later, sitting on the ground with wounds all over, Zhang Tie looked at the bodies of the three dead wild wolves and burst into laughter. By that time, he finally understood the real effect of this Trouble-Reappearance Fruit\u2026Boom\u2026Everything in the space smashed into specks of light and disappeared\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The scent of nature, grass, and wood carried in the breeze instantly caused Zhang Tie to feel relaxed. The breeze flowed through Zhang Tie\u2019s hair and circled around his collar before moving to his sweaty back. That cool sensation was so pleasant that Zhang Tie almost moaned.Today marks the seventh day since Zhang Tie had recovered and left Wild Wolf Castle, and today also marked the seventh day since he resumed his work as a miner. During the past few days, Zhang Tie had gotten accustomed to carrying the mining basket filled with ores and handing it to the delivery point beneath Wild Wolf Castle. In the past, he would usually carry about 50-60 kg of ores at once, and sometimes he would even carry as much as 70 kg; however, over the past seven days, every time, Zhang Tie would carry more than 100 kg of ores. He would hand in the number of ores required for the job in one go, causing the people at the delivery point to be greatly startled. They could have never imagined that Zhang Tie\u2019s average looking frame had such amazing strength, strength that could not be matched with his peers.Over the past seven days, Zhang Tie looked tranquil. Currently, nobody knew that Zhang Tie\u2019s strength had crossed over to the next level. Five days ago when Zhang Tie ate the third Leakless Fruit, as expected, Zhang Tie consecutively broke through three cultivation barriers for the burning point at his rear end, causing the burning point at his rear end to radiate a blue light. With one more Leakless Fruit, the burning point would radiate a purple light, which meant that he would have reached the next level and would officially become a LV 2 soldier. Within a month, he would be able to ignite his second burning point and become a LV 2 soldier\u2014this was truly an astonishing speed. At the very least, Zhang Tie has never heard of someone in Blackhot City who could match his speed in igniting the burning points. Aside from the burning point at his rear end being ignited soon, he also gradually began to see the effects of the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit. Through fighting the three wild wolves several times a day, Zhang Tie could feel an obvious increase in his fighting skills. It was now easier for him to apply the fighting skills he had learned in school, thus allowing him to easily kill the wild wolves.With that great magical treasure, Zhang Tie decided to become even more low-key than before. In the eyes of the others, Zhang Tie was working even harder than before, seemingly as if nothing had even happened; it was as if he had forgotten the whole ordeal of having been attacked by the wild wolves.Like usual, when Zhang Tie placed his mining basket onto the scale at the delivery point, the students from the Second National Male Middle School who were acquainted with Zhang Tie ran over to take a look at the number on the scale once again.\u201c138 kg\u2026 F*ck, you broke the record again! Could one\u2019s strength really improve that fast by doing mining work?\u201d one of the students complained, \u201cI really have to give it a try as well. Zhang Tie looks at ease whenever he hands in his ores. With just one trip, he can already get his rations!\u201d\u201cYou? You should forget about it. Zhang Tie has already ignited his Shrine burning point and has already become a LV 1 soldier!\u201d said the guy beside him as he shook his head and recorded the numbers in his notebook. Then, he gave a glance at Zhang Tie, indicating that he\u2019s asking for a favor of helping them pour the ores from his mining basket into the cart on the rails. In the past, two people were able to finish this task; however, ever since Zhang Tie started to bring more and more ores at once, they would struggle to lift the mining basket of ores, which weighed more than 100 kg, 1m into the air before pouring them into the cart, thus they would always ask Zhang Tie for this favor.\u201cDidn\u2019t Tanin also ignite his Shrine burning point a long time ago and become a LV 1 soldier? How come he doesn\u2019t seem as strong as Zhang Tie\u2026\u201d the fellow who just spoke rebutted as he shot an admiring glance at Zhang Tie. On one side, he helped lift the mining basket, while on the other, he mumbled, \u201cSince he could survive despite falling into a 200 m hole dug by the Gold-Eating Boas, this guy truly is a freak!\u201dZhang Tie didn\u2019t know who this Tanin person was, but he could guess that he was an outstanding student. Listening to their discussion, Zhang Tie just gave a generous smile as he fabricated a lie, \u201cTo tell you the truth, doing mining work is really challenging, especially the part where you have to carry the mining basket out from the mine. As you know, I was not able to carry so many ores in the past; however, over the past few days, I had realized that when I chose to challenge my physical limits, once I clenched my teeth and stuck to it, I would always see an explosive growth in my physical strength at that moment. If you don\u2019t believe me, you can have a try!\u201dAlthough Zhang Tie\u2019s words were half true and half false and contained a little bit of mischief, Zhang Tie expressed it very seriously. If the two guys truly trusted him and wanted to experience this \u201cvery promising vocation\u201d, it would have nothing to do with Zhang Tie. Certainly, one could get stronger through doing labor work; however, the amount of physical strength one could gain would depend on their fortune as well as their efforts.Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but laugh inwardly as he mumbled in his heart, \u201cIf you could enjoy a Leakless Fruit every week like me, then you would also see a rapid growth in your strength.\u201dThese past few days, Zhang Tie would dig in the mines early in the morning before transferring the useless ores into the Castle of Black Iron. Afterwards, he would return to the tree base and would spend the entire afternoon cultivating thePresently, Barley and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood had managed to dig five deep pits and had set more than 20 small traps made from twigs and stones. They had become increasingly proficient at setting traps. The power of their traps was put on full display as beasts would absolutely succumb to the fishy scent from the fish guts and the deep traps. Because of their traps, the Hit-Plane Brotherhood also gradually became famous among the students attending this survival training while some of the other fellows had begun to learn how to set traps from them.After handing over the ores, Zhang Tie had received his rations and was prepared to return to the tree base, but right as he was about to step away, he saw a blue flag that could be seen from miles away hanging at the top of Wild Wolf Castle. A blue flag indicated that a foreign commercial transportation team had reached Wild Wolf Castle, and at the same time, the flag signaled that the students could come to Wild Wolf Castle to exchange items with the commercial team.On the 20th day since the start of the survival training, the commercial transportation team that had set off from Blackhot City had finally arrived at Wild Wolf Castle. Their arrival made many people excited, as it meant that they could sell their items to the commercial team as well as purchase necessities.As expected, the square of Wild Wolf Castle had already become boisterous, as many people surrounded the three transportation vehicles parked on one side of the square. Even Zhang Tie pushed his way inside the crowd. It was the first time for Zhang Tie to see such a transportation vehicle used in the wild. These vehicles were different than the public transport used in Blackhot City; these transportation vehicles that were used in the wild looked strange, as each of them looked like an ugly grasshopper. The vehicle had two low carriages, and its head was like a miniature, round locomotive that was embedded in a square building block, beside which was a tall chimney that was eye-catching. The wheels under its head were composed of two parts\u2014continuous tracks at the front and solid tires in the back. On the second part of its head was a coal bunker. Every one of the wild transportation vehicles was more than 20 m in length. Aside from the onlookers, there were people who were unloading crates one after the other, which quickly occupied the space, turning them into trading platforms. After that, they opened the crates one by one and directly displayed them in front of the public. Most of the things contained in the crates were standard military rations from Blackhot City. Aside from the standard military rations, there were also some dried milk slices, dried meat, and sausages in the crates as well as some biological products used to make experiments.An exclamation reverberated from the horny students next to one wild transportation vehicle at the side. Hearing their exclamations, Zhang Tie pushed his way over and became frightened at the sight before him\u2014f*ck! When the crates were opened, shiny knives and pikes were put on display, greatly exciting the horny students so much that they began to immediately drool.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cEveryone, please take out everything you have, including hides, herbal medicine, crystal sand, and the other strange things that you don\u2019t recognize. As long as you have something good, then you can exchange it with anything here,\u201d A manager of the commercial transportation team jumped onto several crates and shouted loudly into a speaker made from a rolled up iron sheet, \u201cThose who want to exchange your hides, move over there! Those who want to exchange you herbal medicines, move to the middle! Those who want to exchange your crystal sand and other eccentric things, come to me. Hurry up, what are you waiting for!?\u201dHearing his words, many people became excited. The girls ran towards the inner castle, while the boys ran towards Wild Wolf Valley. When he thought of the wolf hides, Zhang Tie was also a bit moved. Seeing the goods brought by the commercial transportation team, Zhang Tie also prepared to go back to bring those hides acquired by the Hit-Plane Brotherhood to exchange them for some necessities like food. For necessities like food, the more they had, the better\u2026Before he left the square of Wild Wolf Castle, Zhang Tie couldn\u2019t help but to look back at those shiny weapons. The knives and pikes lined up in rows had already been hung up in very eye-catching places. Zhang Tie became suspicious, as the commercial transportation teams had rarely brought weapons here in the past years.\u2026\u2026\u201cI don\u2019t agree\u2026\u201d When the square outside Wild Wolf Castle was noisy, a quarrel was occurring in the office of the Temporary Supervision Committee. Miss Qili, who had given Zhang Tie an unforgettable \u201cpunishment\u201d in the small square, was angrily glaring at a businessman with a mustache who was as slim as a stick of bamboo and was wearing a bright, silk hat in the office. \u201cSince Goose-neck Grass and golden wolf marrow cannot be found in Wild Wolf Valley, if they want to collect Goose-neck Grass and golden wolf marrows, then the students would have to leave Wild Wolf Valley and enter deeper into the area between Wild Wolf Valley and the Crescent Prairie. However, that place is too far away from Wild Wolf Castle and there are numerous packs of wolves over there that could pose great dangers to the students attending the survival training!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In contrast, Mr. Zerom looked at the two people who were quarreling with a slightly gloomy expression. As for other teachers, some of them remained quiet, while others were whispering with the people beside them. Most of the teachers in the Temporary Supervision Committee protested against this mission.\u201cEveryone\u2026\u201d The slim and tall man with the bright, silky hat swept his gaze over the others and said in a commanding voice, \u201cI am not here to negotiate with you. I am only here to tell you that Goose-neck Grass and golden wolf marrow are materials that Master Abyan needs to refine medication that\u2019s urgently needed by the military of Blackhot City. Currently, the only place where we can acquire these two things is the Crescent Prairie. Coincidently, the teams participating in the survival training happened to be at Wild Wolf Castle, making your group the closest to Crescent Prairie. Thus, the administration of Blackhot City had entrusted me the task of bringing you this order. For these students, this is just more training and a challenge!\u201d\u201cDo you want the brats to practice by risking their lives?\u201d Mr. Zerom sneered.\u201cIn which year has the survival training been calm and resulted in no one losing their lives!\u201d the man with the silky hat rebutted calmly.\u201cCrescent Prairie is much more danger than Wild Wolf Valley because the wolves over there move in packs. Aside from that, there are LV 2 golden wolves, which cannot be dealt with by the average student. If the administration of Blackhot City is in need of Goose-neck Grass and golden wolf marrow, then they can send someone else here to collect them. There is no need to make the students do something like this that would make them risk their lives\u2026\u201d Captain Kerlin\u2019s single eye glittered with a cold light.\u201cI have served in the military of Blackhot City for many years now, so how come I have never heard of Blackhot City\u2019s military being so extravagant that they\u2019re bringing along recovery medication?\u201dPerhaps it was because he had known about the one-eyed man\u2019s bad temper or because of the one-eyed man\u2019s strength, but the man with the silky hat became a bit reserved; however, he still spoke in a commanding tone, seemingly as if he didn\u2019t care that his lie had been revealed before the people in front of him, \u201cCaptain Kerlin, although we are not qualified to meddle in the matters of the management of the Blackhot City military, we clearly know what has been happening these past few days in the outside world. Now that the relationship between the Andaman Alliance, Blackhot City included, and the Sun Dynasty have become increasingly tense, no surplus military people could be spared. At the same time, several of the big figures need to reserve some recovery medication, thus Master Abyan has been busy recently. This is just a small matter, and I will just release some missions in the name of the Temporary Supervision Committee. Since my superior has already agreed to this, I will be responsible for the details, and what you guys need to do is simply to coordinate with me\u2026\u201d As he said this, the man with the silky hat sneered, showing a typical face of a villain. \u201cOf course, I know you are respected by the students attending this survival training, and I also know that most of them would follow your instructions. If anyone here wants to give me trouble during this mission, then feel free to do so; however, if I cannot complete this mission, then I will faithfully report what had happened here to Master Abyan and the administration of Blackhot City. Hei hei\u2026 at that time, you might not be able to deal with that person like you did with me!\u201dHearing of Master Abyan and the current situation in the Andaman Alliance, everyone became silent. Master Abyan was the chief medical pharmacist of Blackhot City. He was a big figure with a great load of power and had a name that could greatly pressure everyone presently here. For the Andaman Alliance, the situation has been deteriorating for the past few days because of the reappearance of the Red-scarf Burglars, who had caused troubles and then disappeared. The Red-scarf Burglars had suddenly appeared and assaulted Lance City, one of the other cities in the Andaman Alliance. After causing a huge number of casualties and damages, they had once again escaped. Although they were chased by the guards of Lance City, they disappeared at the border between the Andaman Alliance and the Sun Dynasty. As for the guards who were chasing them, they were completely surrounded by the border army of the Sun Dynasty and were wiped out. At the sight of the several photos of the corpses of the guards from Lance City in the territory of the Sun Dynasty, the Sun Dynasty was rather furious as they condemned the Andaman Alliance for destroying the peace between the two parties by trespassing the border of the Sun Dynasty and starting a war. In response to this, the Sun Dynasty\u2019s military had already started to gather at the border. Everyone knew that this was a scheme, but so what? This was not something that they could change in the least. Besides the Norman Empire, the Sun Dynasty had also finally revealed its intentions of wanting to occupy the Andaman Alliance. Hearing this news had already caused the entire Andaman Alliance to be frightened\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s just several golden wolves and a few wolf packs. It isn\u2019t too bad, as it\u2019s possible that the students would have to face the Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty!\u201d seeing as how no one had uttered a single word, the man with the silky hat added.\u201cEvery student is free to make their own decision during the survival training. Nobody is allowed to force them to do anything, not even the administration of Blackhot City and Master Abyan!\u201d Captain Kerlin fixed his gaze onto the man with the silky hat. \u201cThis is our bottom line.\u201d\u201cHeh heh\u2026 Don\u2019t worry! I believe that there are some students out there that would cooperate with me without me having to force them!\u201d The man with the silky hat sneered with confidence\u2026\u2026\u2026Ten minutes later, standing by the windowsill of the outer castle, at the sight of the increasing number of students in front of the mission notice below the outer castle, Captain Kerlin angrily slammed his fist onto the granite windowsill, causing a large piece of stone to fall from the windowsill. Turning his head, Captain Kerlin stared at Mr. Zerom, who looked a bit gloomy. \u201cZerom, you have the best brain here. You tell me, because of the events that had happened within the month, have all the big figures already prepared to retreat?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to explain how a lion would eat a rabbit\u2014those were the words Marshal Lin Changjiang, the leader and governor of the northern border army of the Norman Empire, gave when the Foreign Ministry of the Norman Empire inquired him. Marshal Lin Changjiang had ordered the Foreign Ministry of the Norman Empire to pass along his words without missing a single one, and that is what the Foreign Ministry of the Norman Empire did\u2026\u201d Mr. Zerom also sneered. \u201cPreviously, the lords of the Andaman Alliance thought that they could just curse the Norman Empire as usual as they used the event that had transpired in Blackhot City to finally solve the dispute, while at the same time they would steadily make money; however, nobody could have expected that the Norman Empire didn\u2019t even have the patience to do superficial things and had instead directly shown their intention to attack Blackhot City. Seeing their intentions, it\u2019s within expectations that those fellows who only care about their own business would prepare to escape for their lives. Recovery medication? That\u2019s bullsh*t. Even when others want to chop off their heads, they\u2019re still hurriedly trying to gather some recovery medication. Even when they\u2019re going to lose their lives, they\u2019re still thinking about making money. The reason that Blackhot city could not send out enough people to collect Goose-neck Grass and golden wolf marrow lies in the low compensation. If they could raise the compensation by three to five times, then there would definitely be a great number of pioneers and adventurers who would like to make extra gains in the Crescent Prairie by collecting Goose-neck Grass and golden wolf marrow, both of which are not highly valuable in the least. If they had truly increased the compensation, then the turn to make a profit would never have belonged to Samira, that fellow who\u2019s always looking for an opportunity to be promoted. If they had truly increased the compensation, then they would not cause the students attending the survival training here to have to take on such great risks!\u201d Saying this, Mr. Zerom heaved a deep sigh. \u201cPreviously, we wanted the students to be able to safely complete the survival training as well as leaving them a good memory, but now, it seems that it is impossible!\u201dAs he said this, Mr. Zerom turned around and solemnly looked at Captain Kerlin. \u201cWhen this survival training ends, I will resign and leave Blackhot city\u2026\u201d\u201cYou want to leave?\u201d Captain Kerlin looked at Zerom with wide opened eyes.\u201cI have been thinking it over these past few days. Can\u2019t you see it? Chaos will soon arrive. The big figures in the Sun Dynasty, the Norman Empire, and even in the entire Blackson Human Corridors have already made various preparations for the future. Perhaps in the next three years, five years, or even a decade, the third Holy War between humans and the demons will break out. When that time comes, tens or hundreds of billions of people would turn into corpses as numerous countries and cities will be burned to ruins. However, nobody knows how long the third Holy War would last, and neither do they know whether humans would exist after it. In such troubled times, people will see no bright future by following those who only care about their small business. If I want to find safety, then I will have to find a bigger person since I don\u2019t want to be cannon fodder for those fellows with the silky hats.. What about you? Do you want to go with me? How about leaving together?\u201dCaptain Kerlin frowned as he was currently in an internal struggle. Because of what had happened today, he became frustrated when he connected the events that had happened in Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance, causing his over ten years of loyalty towards the management of Blackhot City to waver. Given what Zerom had said, Captain Kerlin also sensed the aggression from the words of Lin Changjiang, the commander-in-chief of the Northern Border Army who had infuriated all the soldiers, who were still hot-blooded and wanted to repel the Norman Empire\u2019s invasion, of Blackhot City. But, what was the parliament of the Andaman Alliance doing? What was Blackhot City doing? Neither of them had declared war against the Norman Empire\u2019s invasion nor were they prepared to fight to the death; instead, they were quarreling with each other. In the parliament of the Andaman Alliance, there was a great number of people who were shouting loudly to transfer the testimonies and physical evidence collected from the incident from several days ago when the Niumen Business Group colluded with the Red-scarf Burglars to Andaman City. They had requested to hold a motherf*cking hearing in the parliament, and Blackhot City had become flustered and agreed to their request since they wanted to work together to prolong the amount of time they had to prepare for their fight against the Norman Empire. Such a performance had really made Captain Kerlin disappointed. At the same time, the Andaman Alliance\u2019s timidness was fully exposed. The people who only cared about counting gold coins and making small business might be able to live well in a peaceful age; however, in troubled times such as now, they could only be a piece of fat on the kneading board that would be freely chopped by others.\u201cAre you still thinking about Miss Daina? Are you still afraid that that great beauty isn\u2019t ready to go out with you?\u201d Zerom put it straightforwardly, completely hitting the mark at what Captain Kerlin was concerned about.Hearing him mention Miss Daina, Captain Kerlin\u2019s face instantly blushed. He then rebutted like a kid, \u201cSo what!? I have already saved up enough money. I can immediately buy a house near Bright Avenue that\u2019s more than 100 square meters\u2026\u201d\u201cWow, how romantic you are! You are truly a god-created couple\u2026\u201d Zerom showed a strange smile.\u201cB*stard\u2026\u201d Captain Kerlin threw a punch towards Zerom. Having long been prepared, Zerom instantly slid to the side and exited through the door, causing Captain Kerlin to fail to hit him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cTrust me, Kerlin, you two are not suitable for each other!\u201d Before leaving, Zerom told Captain Kerlin seriously.\u201cNonsense. I feel that Miss Daina treats me well!\u201d Captain Kerlin stuck to rebut.\u201cThat\u2019s just your misconception!\u201d\u201cWhy are you saying that?\u201d\u201cHave you ever heard of a wild goose falling in love with a bear?\u201d After saying this, without even glancing at Captain Kerlin\u2019s infuriated face, Zerom quickly escaped. \u201cI have to keep an eye on that man with the silky hat. If he goes too far, then I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to give him some trouble. Luckily, my students are all clever. I hope your students are as rational as mine!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_When Zhang Tie along with Doug and Barley returned to the small square with a large amount of items, he found that the square was many times more boisterous than when he had left. In front of the several exchange points, there were groups of students standing in lines as they held onto the items they were planning to exchange with the stuff brought by the commercial transportation team.Zhang Tie and the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood had mainly brought hides; they had brought five wolf hides, three of which were hunted by Zhang Tie, a hedgehog hide, and two rabbit hides. Although these hides were not too valuable, they could still be exchanged for a lot of food. Although the hides had been tanned, they still released a weird smell in the tree base, thus if they were able to sell off these hides this time, then it would allow their tree base to smell a little better.\u201cBighead, what do you want to exchange your three wolf hides for?\u201d Barley asked.\u201cJust exchange them all for rations.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you need money? These items could easily sell for more than 20 silver coins!\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t need money at the moment. What we need right now is food, which is why I prefer to exchange for food. As long as we pass this survival training, all is well!\u201d Zhang Tie smiled.Barley glanced at Zhang Tie with a strange look. He didn\u2019t know what had happened to Zhang Tie; Barley felt that Zhang Tie had been more relaxed when dealing with things. His decisions carried a bit of laziness, but it was mixed with braveness and decisiveness. Could this be an effect of the Iron-Blood Fist? No, it\u2019s not like that. Barley couldn\u2019t convince himself at all, as they were all practicing the Iron-Blood Fist using the same book, so how could Zhang Tie improve so much faster than the others? Not to mention that Barley had also noticed that Zhang Tie was changing spiritually, but Barley was confused at how Zhang Tie, a guy who only dug in the mines and practiced the Iron-Blood Fist skill together with them every day, could make a spiritual breakthrough.Is doing mining work that effective? Should I give it a try myself?\u201cFine, then do whatever you want. Doug and I are enough to queue up here!\u201d Hearing fatty Barley\u2019s words, Doug, who was standing beside him, also patted his chest with a grin. During the past week, Doug had gotten used to flattering Zhang Tie.There truly wasn\u2019t a need for three people to line up here, so seeing that Doug and Barley were already standing in line, Zhang Tie then decided to wander around the small square. Seeing that there were many onlookers near the gate of Wild Wolf Castle, Zhang Tie also moved there.The moment Zhang Tie drew close, he heard several guys fervently talking about the missions on the notice board.\u201cIf only I could get some Goose-neck Grass\u2026 One stick of Goose-neck Grass is almost worth more than one gold coin! That amount could be exchanged for a good machete or a sword!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also the golden wolf. If one kills a golden wolf, then you could acquire the marrow in the spine of the wolf, which is even more valuable than a stick of Goose-neck Grass. Not to mention a good machete or sword, you could even exchange it for 3 kg of meat and 7 kg of rations! If I could kill a golden wolf, then I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about my life for the next couple of weeks\u2026\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s not that easy to get those items. Haven\u2019t you read the notice? We can only get them by the border of Wild Wolf Valley and the Crescent Prairie, which is 30 km away. I have heard that there are dozens of times more wolf packs over in the Crescent Prairie when compared to Wild Wolf Valley. Facing dozens or even hundreds of wolves\u2026 we could easily be torn apart, leaving not even a single bone behind\u2026\u201dHearing their words, Zhang Tie slightly frowned before pushing his way through the crowd and arriving below the notice board. At the top of the notice board were the missions on hunting golden wolves and picking Goose-neck Grass. Aside from the notices, they had especially hung two large pictures, one of the golden wolf and the other the Grass-neck Grass, respectively to the left and right of the notice boards, ensuring that everyone knew what they looked like. A man with a silky hat that was as slim as a stick of bamboo was inciting the onlookers below the notice board as his saliva sprayed everywhere in the air.\u201cMaster Abyan is the chief medicinal pharmacist of Blackhot City, and he needs golden wolf marrow and Goose-neck Grass since both are raw materials needed to concoct recovery medication. Do you know what recovery medication is? Recovery medication is a marvelous medicine that can allow the fighters of Blackhot City to heal and recover their strength as soon as possible after being wounded on the battlefield\u2026\u201d At this moment, the man with the silky hat raised his hands and exclaimed, \u201cBrave, young men! Do you know what\u2019s currently happening in Blackhot City? The evil Norman Empire has already been showing their machetes towards Blackhot City and your family. Soon, Blackhot City could very well end up in a bloody fight with the army of the Norman Empire. For the sake of Blackhot City and your relatives who may join the army of Blackhot City, please go and bring back golden wolf marrows and Goose-neck Grass! Every stick of Goose-neck Grass could possibly save your relative\u2019s life. Master Abyan, the revered chief medicinal pharmacist of Blackhot city, is now in need of these two items. Brave young men, brave men from Blackhot city, take your machetes and swords and march on towards the Crescent Prairie! Use the corpses of the golden wolves and the Golden-neck Grass to display your braveness! Look! Those beauties are watching you present your braveness\u2026\u201dThe words from the man with the silky hat were extremely aggressive. Combined with his passionate voice and the mood, he had created a splendid performance. As a result, many people among the onlookers became excited and were ferociously discussing with each other, as it was the first time for everyone to hear about what was happening between the Norman Empire and Blackhot City.\u201cTell us, what is happening between the Norman Empire and Blackhot City right now?\u201d a young man among the onlookers asked loudly.\u201cYou guys really don\u2019t know? Haven\u2019t your teachers told you about it? Several days ago, a very terrible incident had happened in Blackhot City. The northern border army of the Norman Empire have been grooming their war horses and training their troops in preparations to invade Blackhot City, your hometown. That\u2019s why, Blackhot City is currently in its weakest state. This is the most critical moment for the brave men of Blackhot City to stand out and do something for the sake of their hometown\u2026\u201dAt this moment, the crowd became restless. Since they have stayed here for almost 20 days now, many of them truly did not know what was happening in Blackhot City. Having been incited by Samira, everyone became restless.Within the crowd, Zhang Tie frowned, as he instinctively felt that there was something wrong with the words spoken by the man with the silky hat. Although the others didn\u2019t know what recovery medication was, Zhang Tie certainly knew what it was, as he had worked in Donder\u2019s grocery store for a long time and that store even had two of such items. According to Donder, in Blackhot City, even the price of the lowest quality recovery medication would never drop below 10 gold coins. This was simply something that was never meant to be available to the commoners and common soldiers. However, this bastard had lied to them and was inciting them to go get these two items in the Crescent Prairie, causing them to lose their mind. It was obvious that he had bad intentions towards them.Sweeping his gaze over the flustered students, Zhang Tie instantly saw Zerom frowning and gloomily glaring at the man who was gritting his teeth and loudly inciting the student. Rolling his eyes, an idea came to Zhang Tie\u2019s mind.He silently retreated back into the crowd and lowered his body before shouting loudly.\u201cEveryone, don\u2019t listen to him! That guy is telling a lie! He wants us to be cannon fodder in Crescent Prairie. Even the most common of recovery medication would cost more than 10 gold coins per vial and is simply something our relatives cannot afford. We should listen to our teachers. If something has happened in Blackhot City, then our teachers would let us know. Don\u2019t listen to that strange fellow\u2019s provocative words\u2026\u201dAlthough these young, horny students were always impulsive, it wasn\u2019t as if there was something wrong with their minds. Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s warning, many of the horny students realized that they didn\u2019t have a reason to trust this strange fellow. At the very least, was there a relationship between a recovery medication that was worth more than ten gold coins and their relatives? Why should they have to risk their lives in the Crescent Prairie?Standing below the notice board, Samira was so angry that his face had even begun to twitch. Earlier, he was waiting for a great number of students to help him make money, but unexpectedly, someone had jumped out to give him trouble and had exposed him.\u201cWho!? Who said that!? Come out!\u201d Samira hysterically growled with a vicious expression while his eyes swept over the crowd of many students before him.After stealthily moving to another place, Zhang Tie pinched his nose and shouted again, \u201cThat fellow gets exposed and now he\u2019s infuriated. Brothers, look at his terrifying triangular eyes that are in the shape of a poisonous snake\u2019s head. That\u2019s definitely what a sinister person looks like! A kind-hearted person would not have such terrifying, triangular eyes. Tell your friends not to be cheated by that guy! Don\u2019t help him make money by risking your lives! We will stay in Wild Wolf Valley and never go to the Crescent Prairie\u2026\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the horny students began to fervently discuss and many of them had even begun to study the shape of Samira\u2019s eyes. Descriptive words like \u201cterrifying triangular eyes\u201d, \u201cthe shape of a poisonous snake\u2019s head\u201d, and \u201chow a sinister person looks like\u201d were really lethal. At this time, Samira became so furious that he jumped up from the ground and his face had turned purple. However, facing the doubting eyes, he had no other choice but to force a smile\u2026As the students were noisily discussing, Zhang Tie silently slid out from the crowd and went to meet up with Barley and Doug. Seeing what was happening in the crowd, Zerom\u2019s expression was really resplendent. Since the moment Zhang Tie had spoken, he had already realized that it was Zhang Tie\u2019s voice. What Zhang Tie had performed just now had really shocked him. He would never have expected that Zhang Tie could see through Samira\u2019s lies and would alert the onlookers by shouting in public, all the while not being caught. Zhang Tie had done everything that Zerom had wanted to and had even done it perfectly. As Zhang Tie was leaving, those excited, horny animals had already begun to discuss Samira\u2019s looks and his terrifying, triangular eyes\u2026Zhang Tie had exchanged his three wolf hides for a bit more than 4 kg of rations, though Barley said that Zhang Tie had suffered a loss, as the price of the three wolf hides were more than 20 silver coins and the commercial transportation team had only given Zhang Tie ten silver coins worth of rations. Seeing this, Doug had also become furious.Despite this, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t particularly care about it; instead, he placated Barley and Doug. As they were about to leave Wild Wolf Castle, Zhang Tie had caught sight of Burwick. Surrounded by a great number of people, Burwick walked over high-spiritedly, while every person following him was holding onto several wolf hides. With a casual glance, one could see approximately a hundred wolf hides\u2026Everybody gave way to Burwick. At that moment, Burwick was extremely eye-catching. However, at the sight of Burwick\u2019s calm face that hid his pride, Zhang Tie suddenly thought of the man with the silky hat.\u201cCould Burwick be working with Samira?\u201dA thought suddenly came to Zhang Tie\u2019s mind!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat is happening in Blackhot City? Has the letter I sent to the military of Blackhot been received? Did it catch the eyes of the management of Blackhot City ? Are mom, dad, and elder brother ok?\u201dWhat that guy had said still silently shocked Zhang Tie\u2019s mind.Soon after Zhang Tie, Barley, and Doug had left Wild Wolf Castle, the Temporary Supervision Committee, who was responsible for this survival training, posted a notice in the square of Wild Wolf Castle, which introduced what had happened between Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance in the past weeks. All the horny students learned that many big events had happened in Blackhot City and Andaman Alliance within the month they had attended the survival training. Knowing that the Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty were baring their sharp fangs so quickly towards Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance, everybody was startled.Could it be that a war between the Andaman Alliance, the Norman Empire, and the Sun Dynasty was waiting for their graduation?A special atmosphere started to cover Wild Wolf Valley!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_On the highest point of Wild Wolf Castle, besides the blue flag, there was another flag; there was a red flag raised up, which meant that important news or a notice had been released. Even from several kilometers away from Wild Wolf Castle, everyone could see that red flag.On the evening when Zhang Tie had sent back Pandora and a group of girls who had wanted to form a team with the Hit-Plane Brotherhood to Wild Wolf Castle, Zhang Tie had already known of the contents of that notice.Compared to the amazed expressions of the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, Zhang Tie had already mentally prepared himself for the arrival of this piece of news. While everyone in Wild Wolf Valley was noisily discussing the situation in Blackhot City, not a single one of them knew that Zhang Tie was the one who had accidentally triggered the entire incident in Blackhot City. This event was the hottest topic both in Wild Wolf Valley and Blackhot City. As for the identity of the one that had sent out the letter which started the entire incident in Blackhot City, nobody was able to give an answer; however, the government of Blackhot City did exert all their efforts in an attempt to find this person, but in the end, it was still not enough to reverse the flow of time back to the day when the mysterious person had sent that letter through the mailbox by the post office located in the city square of Blackhot City. It had already turned into a secret that would never be revealed. It was only when this event had broken out in Blackhot City that everyone knew that the Red-scarf Burglars, who were well-prepared and were conspiring with the Niumuen Business Group to take over Blackhot City both internally and externally, had been lurking in a hidden location that was less than 150 km away from Blackhot City. When the Niumuen Business Group was swept out by the army of Blackhot City and had schemes exposed, the Red-scarf Burglars retreated from their hiding spot like a pack of wolves, and when they had reappeared, they caused a disaster in Lance City and involved the Sun Dynasty in this chaos, leading them to confronting the Andaman Alliance.\u201cMysterious Warner\u201d\u2014that was the nickname that Zhang Tie had received when the incident broke out in Blackhot City. Some said that the \u201cMysterious Warner\u2019, the person who had started the incident in Blackhot City, was a bandit that was part of the Red-scarf Burglars, some said that this \u201cMysterious Warner\u201d was a top fighter who lived in seclusion in Blackhot City, while there were also some who said that this \u201cMysterious Warner\u201d was a political enemy of Marshal Lin Changjiang, the governor of the northern border of the Norman Empire\u2026 There were all kinds of speculations about the \u201cMysterious Warner\u201d; however, no one had guessed that the \u201cMysterious Warner\u201d was actually just an ordinary youth from an ordinary national male middle school situated in Blackhot City that was currently attending a survival training in Wild Wolf Valley. Not to mention, the same youth had even almost destroyed an influential figure\u2019s intention to obtain recovery medication in Blackhot City.Sometimes, there were rumors that were grounded with strong logic, and there were also various possibilities that seemed true; however, truth was something that was always extremely dramatic, as the people\u2019s daily lives and the earthly world doesn\u2019t give one the opportunity to be rational and logical. This was just like a famous story on the well-known Butterfly Effect[1]. There was once a blacksmith who had dropped a nail on the ground, which later injured a horse\u2019s hoof. Because the horse was wounded, the knight who rode it lost a battle, which directly influenced the war between two nations, finally leading to the destruction of a country.Zhang Tie had learned this theory in science class at school. It was only when he had heard of the incident in Blackhot City did Zhang Tie realize that what he had rightly done was drop the nail that wounded the horse\u2019s hoof. After walking into Huck, who had already been killed by Zhang Tie, near the railway station, he had changed so many things.The \u201cnail\u201d had truly changed some of the details and slowed the development of the situation; however, the Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty were already rolling without stop towards the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot City, much like huge wheels with unstoppable momentum. Just the start of the huge, rolling wheels had already created great waves in Wild Wolf Valley.Many of the people here had to serve in the army after graduation, which meant that they would have to directly face these two huge forces, the Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty, and perhaps they may even fight the army of these two countries on the battlefield, thus all the students attending the survival training in Wild Wolf Valley felt as if a huge burden had been placed on their fates. Facing the incoming and uncertain future, many people felt confused and frightened.Tonight, with the exception of Zhang Tie, everyone else in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood was trying their best to cultivate the basic skills of Iron-Blood Fist. They continued to do so until they were all extremely fatigued and were gasping as they laid on the grass.In truth, Zhang Tie could actually stick to it for a while longer; however, when he saw Bagdad, with eyes fixed on him, practicing the Lying-Tiger Stake as the blue veins on his forehead especially stood out, Zhang Tie could only pretend to be exhausted before throwing himself onto the ground. Ten seconds after Zhang Tie had \u201cgiven up\u201d, Bagdad, who was no longer able to hold on, also heaved a deep sigh and ended his practice. For Bagdad, if he couldn\u2019t remain the strongest fighter in the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, then it would be a great strike to his pride.Two moons hung in the sky\u2014one was a silver crescent, while the other was a pale blue full moon; one was big, while the other was small. The moonlight cascaded down and enveloped Wild Wolf Valley with a layer of a beautiful, pale blue, and white brilliance. Accompanied by the two moons, the stars in the sky looked particularly splendent, the cicadas on the Dragon-Claw Trees were chirping, the crickets in the grass were tweeting, while the howls of the looming wolves drifted over; the entire Wild Wolf Valley was extremely tranquil.The members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood simply laid there and silently looked at the sky for more than ten minutes.\u201cIf I was killed on the battlefield, someone who is still alive among you must remember to hand over my pension to my family since that amount of money could allow my two younger brothers to live a bit better!\u201d Sharwin silently opened his mouth. Sharwin was good in all aspects, except he was too pessimistic sometimes.\u201cYou\u2019d better stay alive. If you die, we would only use your pension to sleep with women and let your bastard dad and two younger brothers go to hell!\u201d Hista cursed.\u201cBastard!\u201d Sharwin cursed in a low voice before he laughed out loudly.\u201cI heard the Iron-Horn Army Group under the flagship of Lin Changjiang, the governor of the Northern Border Army Group of Norman Empire, and the Brilliant Feathers of the Sun Dynasty are both composed of war maniacs and madmen. Do you think we might encounter them?\u201d Doug said dejectedly.\u201cDon\u2019t be that pessimistic. We should not be that unlucky to have to fight against the armies of the Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty. As for the entire Andaman Alliance, those two countries are two super powers, each of whom is much more powerful than the Andaman Alliance. Because of this great gap in force, if there truly is a battle with any one of the two countries, the Andaman Alliance would definitely lose. Since the wealthy big figures are definitely more afraid of death than us, I think that a war would not break out. For the Andaman Alliance, this is a war that they are doomed to lose, and they would never bet on this war at the risk of their own lives. Two kids with the same strength might fight over a piece of candy, but a tough man would never fight a kid, let alone two tough men fighting a kid at the same time\u2026\u201d Lying on the ground, Leit said so.\u201cHmm, I feel that Leit\u2019s words are reasonable. We don\u2019t need to feel that stressed!\u201d Barley added.\u201cEven if a war doesn\u2019t break out, the Andaman Alliance would still not have a bright future. In the history of Blackson Human Clan Corridor, it has always consisted of at most 70 city-states; however, this number has been gradually decreasing. In the end, every city-state would see one of two outcomes. The first would be the emergence of a talented or mighty figure who would unite them all into a country. The other would be that the city-states would break apart and be annexed by the surrounding powers. For the Andaman Alliance, it doesn\u2019t have a talented or mighty figure, and under their eyes, the Norman Empire and the Sun Dynasty would never allow it to become a united country, thus the final outcome for the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot City might be being annexed by either the Norman Empire or the Sun Dynasty. Once annexed, this region would face high coercion for at least the next few dozen years. If this matter cannot be settled through peaceful manners, then even if we don\u2019t die on the battlefields, we would not be able to live well in the future\u2026\u201d Sharwin continued to speak in a pessimistic way.Hearing Sharwin\u2019s words, everyone became silent once again. No one rebutted, as they all knew that Sharwin was telling the heaviest and undeniable truth.\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that even if we\u2019re not cannon fodder on the battlefield, we would be slaves after our country dies. Hmm, although the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot City cannot be considered a country, it\u2019s almost the same!\u201d Hista said dejectedly.\u201cFor this event, I feel\u2026 it will be settled through peaceful means!\u201d Barley said in an unconfident and low voice.\u201cBut, I have always felt that something is off. The Andaman Alliance, the Sun Dynasty, and the Norman Empire have maintained peace for over half a century, so why are they giving us trouble now at the same time?\u201d Doug suddenly hit the key point like an idiot.Not knowing the reason, when he heard Doug\u2019s words, Zhang Tie suddenly thought back to the squirrels that were busily storing pine nuts in the trees to survive through the winter.\u201cNo matter what reason it is, if it is related to us, we will know about it sooner or later. That\u2019s why, we don\u2019t need to rack our brains on that matter\u2026\u201d Bagdad gloomily said. \u201cThe most important thing for us right now is to improve our own strength. As you know, in this age, people without strength will not have freedom. Only when we have strength could we control our own fate. If we are well-practiced in the Iron-Blood Fist Skill, then why would we need to be concerned about these boring questions?\u201d\u201cBighead, why are you silent? Aren\u2019t you worried\u2026\u201d Lying on the ground, Barley turned his head and asked Zhang Tie.\u201cI think you are all right. But to tell you the truth, I don\u2019t really care about the future of Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance too much. Perhaps it is because I am Chinese, a minority in Blackhot City of the Andaman Alliance. I am not able to assume any more responsibilities for the fate of the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot City. My family has already sacrificed one life for the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot City. No matter what, I do not want my family to sacrifice another life for them, and neither would I make such a sacrifice. I only have a few desires in my life. As long as my loved ones can live well, as long as I have enough money and beloved women, then I will be satisfied\u2026\u201d Looking at the beautiful stars in the sky, Zhang Tie forced a smile. What happened in Blackhot City and the Andaman Alliance really shocked him a lot. Although he had changed the speed of the development to some degree, he realized he couldn\u2019t change the final outcome. At the very least, the fate of his loved ones have not changed at all. This was the cause of the feelings of frustrations and powerlessness that small figures would feel.Bagdad\u2019s words were true. Instead of hoping for the world to develop like your imagination, it was better to make yourself stronger, as this was true strength. In contrast, everything else was bullsh*t. For Zhang Tie himself, if he wanted to become powerful, he would have to depend on the Castle of Black Iron and the small tree within.Although Zhang Tie had never thought that he was selfish, sometimes, the Castle of Black Iron and the small tree brought Zhang Tie a sense of selfishness. If this age could be seen as a large wheel that was rolling forward, then Zhang Tie felt that, with the exception of himself, who was someone who could jump out of its path and stay in his own world, everyone else could only be chased by the large wheel that surged forth as they oozed sweat all over. The world where Zhang Tie stayed in was also a wheel that only belonged to Zhang Tie. Although it was very small, Zhang Tie could happily push it forward in a speed faster than the others. Soon after, the others would be far behind him and his world. Zhang Tie felt that he was truly a bit heartless; although everyone else was concerned about the future of Blackhot City and the Andaman ALliance, he was just thinking about how many mining baskets filled with ores he should move into the Castle of Black Iron in order to quickly increase the amount of basic energy storage inside. While everyone was worried about turning into slaves in the occupied areas in the future, Zhang Tie was thinking about his circumcision after the completion of the survival training. \u201c Damn it! It truly does not feel good to be a virgin among a group of horny students.\u201d Honestly, Zhang Tie really didn\u2019t think that the fate of the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot city was more important than his circumcision surgery. \u201cAm I selfish? If this is being selfish, then I prefer to be selfish. Who f*cking decided that the future of the Andaman Alliance and Blackhot City is more important than my future? Who the f*ck decided that the \u2018sexual pleasures\u2019 of the privileged figures are more important than my \u2018sexual pleasures\u2019? Who the f*ck decided that a small figure like me has to share difficulties with the big figures, but not the pleasures? F*ck, I will do what I can do and I will enjoy myself. So what!?\u201dIn the current situation, it was as if many naked people were struggling to rush forward in the snowfield in order to escape the snowstorm that was chasing them. In contrast, Zhang Tie was sitting inside the train and was eating hot pot, leaving the group of people behind along with the \u201ccrack crack\u201d sounds made by the moving train. This was another lifestyle that had been brought by the Castle of Black Iron and that small tree. If he didn\u2019t have the small tree and the Castle of Black Iron, then Zhang Tie would have been just like them; he would have been a member of the people rushing forward in the snowfield as they tried to escape from the snowstorm that was chasing them. Fortunately, he had that small tree and the Castle of Black Iron, allowing him to sit in the train to enjoy hot pot. If he could enjoy such a good treatment, then why not enjoy it? Anyone with a normal mind would make this choice!\u2026\u2026It was Zhang Tie\u2019s turn to be on duty for the first half of the evening tonight. Crouching in a pit on the tree, Zhang Tie watched and listened to the surroundings while visualizing an abacus in his mind as he practiced mental arithmetic using the abacus. He practiced various operations. He did addition and subtraction with numbers between 1 to 1000. He did multiplication with any two digit numbers, any two digit numbers with three digit numbers, and any two digit numbers with four digit numbers; he had even done the reverse with division. Over the past few days, Zhang Tie hadn\u2019t give up on practicing mental arithmetics using the abacus, and as a result, he has made steady improvements to his calculation skills. Now, with just a glimpse, he would easily get the answer of any addition or subtraction problem within three digits, and any multiplication or division problem between two digit numbers. Additionally, as a benefit of his boring yet self-gratifying training, his spiritual energy had also gradually increased. Compared to his spiritual energy when he had started the survival training, Zhang Tie\u2019s spiritual energy had already increased by about 2%.It was only when Barley had replaced him for the second half of the night did Zhang Tie climb back into his own hole to sleep. At the sight of Zhang Tie, Barley was also curious. While the others always looked extremely tired the morning after their duty, how come this guy becomes even more high-spirited when he finishes his duty? Could it be that he had adapted to the nightlife?After he finished practicing mental arithmetic using the abacus, Zhang Tie lied down, but he did not fall asleep; instead, he silently injected his spiritual energy into the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit, leading to him entering another virtual world\u2026\u2026\u2026It was the same dusk, the same valley, the same path, the same grass where the wolves had drilled out and charged towards him. Zhang Tie waved his dagger towards them\u2026Several minutes later, the three wolves turned into corpses once again. Looking at that wound on his hand that was left by the sharp fang of one of the wolves, Zhang Tie shook his head\u2026Boom\u2026Everything turned into specks of lights.\u2026\u2026One minute later, after Zhang Tie injected his spiritual energy into that Trouble-Reappearance Fruit to activate the same scene once again, Zhang Tie entered it for the second time tonight.It was the same dusk, the same valley, the same path, and the same grass\u2026This time, Zhang Tie changed his \u201ctrick\u201d. Before the wolves had drilled out of the grass, Zhang Tie had already rushed into the grass to fight the three wolves with his dagger. However, after this trial, Zhang Tie realized that grass was more restrictive to humans than it was to wolves. In fact, the latter even had more advantages in the grass. The result of this fight was that Zhang Tie once again became afraid of death and pain\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhang Tie then exited the scene and rushed inside one minute later\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhang Tie repeated this process until his spiritual energy was exhausted. When he could no longer activate the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit, he fell asleep.\u2026\u2026The other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood would never know that this guy sleeping beside them had already experienced eight life-or-death fights with three wolves in a hidden place which only existed in Zhang Tie\u2019s mind within half an hour since he finished his duty. Through fighting many times, Zhang Tie had suffered less wounds than before, and the three wolves had died faster than before\u2026Before he fell asleep, one last thought appeared in his mind\u2014maybe I should jump into that deep hole left by the Gold-Eating Boas again tomorrow and see what kind of feeling it will give\u2026[1] Butterfly Effect: A small matter triggers successively bigger events.

    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator:\u00a0WQL\u00a0\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Geoffrey_Today, the news of Burwick leading his \u201cMale Lion Association\u201d, which was composed of a group of horny students from the Seventh National Male Middle School, to cooperate with the Samira Business Group from Blackhot City had become the biggest news in Wild Wolf Castle. They had marched towards Crescent Prairie to hunt golden wolves as well as to pick Goose-neck Grass.To support them, the Samira Business Group had provided Burwick\u2019s team several crates of rations and had also gifted Burwick a war blade, an entire set of armor, and several sets of equipment used to hunt wolves. With these items in hand, Burwick and his lackeys held a magnificent pledge ceremony in the square of Wild Wolf Castle. After the pledge ceremony, Burwick, like a general, led the group of more than 200 \u201cMale Lion Association\u201d members to march towards Crescent Prairie.Almost one fifth of the students attending this survival training from the Seventh National Male Middle School followed Burwick to prepare for the march towards Crescent Prairie.At this pledge ceremony, in the square, many girls screamed Burwick\u2019s name as their eyes were fixed on Burwick\u2019s fascinating smile and his brilliant blonde hair. Currently, Burwick had been so well known among the students attending this survival training that he was even regarded as the best one among all the students who were attending this survival training.Because of the magnificent scene, many of the horny students became hot-blooded, as even they had dreamed of being Burwick, someone who could enjoy the cheers from the girls. The news of Burwick leading his team on their march towards Crescent Valley to hunt the LV 2 golden wolves and to forage for Goose-neck Grass, which were ingredients that could be used to save lives, was publicized in a heroic manner by the Samira\u2019s Business Group as they called it a righteous action, causing Burwick to turn into a hero as well as the most brilliant star in this survival training in the eyes of many girls. .While Burwick became the star in the eyes of all the other students, Zhang Tie, who was like a miner, was watching Buwick\u2019s brilliance as he stood on one side of the square. He had been wearing the same mining clothes for three consecutive days. Mining was something which made it hard for people to remain clean and tidy, and as such, Zhang Tie\u2019s clothes and face both looked dirty. After working hard for an entire morning, the sweat covering his forehead and temples would sketch several clear mud marks onto his face. Simply by being close to him, girls with a keen sense of smell would be able to smell his sweat. Compared to the general-like Burwick, who was equipped with an entire set of armor, Zhang Tie was absolutely a peasant; there truly was a sharp contrast between them.Zhang Tie looked at those high-spirited, horny students of the \u201cMale Lion Association\u201d with eyes that contained a slight gloominess and sympathy as he cursed inwardly\u2014idiots!Burwick\u2019s ambitions and his mercilessness had both shocked Zhang Tie as well as made him alert. Because a golden wolf was a LV 2 beast, even Burwick, a LV 1 soldier who had ignited his Shrine burning point, should know that no matter how well the members of the Male Lion Association could cooperate with each other, if they wanted to keep the marrow fresh when they sent it to Blackhot City, then they would have to surround the golden wolves before hunting them. If a group of LV 0 soldiers were to do this, then there would definitely be casualties. Despite this, Burwick was still prepared to use his influence and the trust placed in him by those horny students to go through with this. This meant that those horny students were merely stepping stones in his heart, ones which could be sacrificed at any time. If Glaze was a ferocious wolf who was ready to bare his fangs, then Burwick would be a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. Burwick was more sinister and more terrifying, as he had hidden his ambitions and mercilessness, pretending to be harmless among a pack of sheep, thus he looked much more dangerous and was able to confuse others.Zhang Tie didn\u2019t intend to be something great nor did he plan to be some motherf*cking righteous messenger. He felt that even if he spoke up at this moment, it would not work on those horny guys, as the blood had already rushed to their head. Anyone who was able to capture a golden wolf or pick a stalk of Goose-neck Grass would be rewarded with an excellent war blade. Although this compensation given by the Samira Business Group was very cheap, for many students, it still made the blood rush to their heads. Exchanging one\u2019s life for a weapon that would be used to serve others at the cost of one\u2019s life\u2014Zhang Tie truly looked down on such compensation and felt as if it was an insult to his intelligence. However, facing such compensation, some of the horny students looked extremely excited, which really caused Zhang Tie to be at a loss for words. Perhaps those horny students still dreamt of being referred to Master Abyan by the Samira Business Group if they performed well, letting him know of their name and perhaps allowing them to become his assistant or apprentice. To become an assistant or an apprentice of Master Abyan was a rare opportunity that was akin to taking a step towards heaven. There was no person who didn\u2019t want to become the next Li Shizhen, a student from the Seventh National Male Middle School from many years ago who had been chosen to be an apprentice of the Pharmacists Association. However, because this promise was made by the man with the silky hat named Samira, Zhang Tie completely treated it as bullsh*t. Nevertheless, there were still many people who trusted his words. Those fellows didn\u2019t realize that even if Samira\u2019s words were true, Burwick would be the one to obtain the opportunity to be promoted and not them. The fact was that after a war, there would be piles of corpses from soldiers that were as high as a mountain, yet the only one who would earn reputation and praise would be the general!In Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes, this expedition was a trap which used the weaknesses of human nature; this trap was a huge pit which was dug on the basis of trust and greed and was also the most common trap. Clear-minded people would be able to see through it at the first sight; however, there would always be people who would jump in, and Zhang Tie would not be able to stop them. He felt as if he had already done what he should have done. What the others decided to do would be their choice. At any moment, he is not obliged to sacrifice himself for the safety of others.\u201cBesides yourself, nobody is responsible for your life. Horny students, I hope that you will learn to understand the motto of our school\u2014\u2018Welcome to the Age of Black Iron\u2019. After having stayed at school for three years, it seems that you have yet to understand that line. It seems that it\u2019s just like what Donder had said. In this age, the thing that is the blackest and the most iron-like is the human heart,\u201d Zhang Tie mumbled inwardly.\u2026\u2026At the end of the pledge ceremony, standing on that temporary platform, Burwick, who always forced a smile and spoke in a very energetic fashion, looked back several times. When he realized that none of the teachers from the Temporary Supervision Committee were present and were not even watching their performance from the walls of the outer castle, Burwick became a bit disappointed.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to be disappointed. A recommendation from your school is not more valuable than being known by Master Abyan\u2026\u201d Seemingly as if he had seen through the slight disappointment in Burwick\u2019s eyes, Samira consoled him in a low voice that was only audible to Burwick. \u201cWhether or not the military academy of the Andaman Alliance would still exist in the future is uncertain; however, no matter who rules Blackhot City, Master Abyan would still be able to garner absolute respect. As a smart individual, you should understand what I mean!\u201d\u201cI know what to do!\u201d Burwick replied in low voice.\u201cGood luck then. I almost forgot to tell you. There\u2019s a student from your school named Glaze that reached out to me because he also wanted to get this opportunity to be introduced to Master Abyan. As for whether there are more great figures in your school who dream for this opportunity, this is something that I do not know. That\u2019s why, young man, you need to work hard. Only the most excellent people would be able to obtain this opportunity!\u201d Samira added.\u201cI will try my best!\u201d Hearing Samira\u2019s words, Burwick\u2019s face slightly became stiff before catching sight of Zhang Tie, who was not eye-catching, in the distance. Although Zhang Tie was not eye-catching, his mining basket certainly was. At the sight of Zhang Tie, Burwick\u2019s eyes became filled with excitement. He then turned and told Samira with a smile, \u201cHmm, I forgot to tell you. That person in the crowd who gave you trouble the other day was Zhang Tie, that black-haired brat with the mining basket on his back. I\u2019ve heard that he is already a LV 1 soldier and that Captain Kerlin and Zerom seem to have high hopes for him!\u201dThe corner of Samira\u2019s eyes twitched a couple of times. Even now, Samira still felt that someone in the crowd was cursing him with words like \u201cpoisonous snake\u2019s head\u201d and \u201ctriangular eyes\u201d. Samira casually looked at Zhang Tie, who was far away, while forcing a smile on his skinny, horse-like face. \u201cWell, I know what to do!\u201d\u201cHappy collaboration!\u201d\u201cHappy collaboration!\u201d\u2026\u2026After the pledge ceremony, Burwick and his followers left the small square of Blackhot City in a heroic manner, resulting in the noisy square finally regaining its calm. The moment Burwick\u2019s team left, the Temporary Supervision Committee released a notice to hold a bonfire party in the small square tonight. According to the notice, the girls will be holding performances like singing and dancing during the bonfire party. Hearing that news, many horny students became excited. Unknown why, at the sight of this notice, Zhang Tie knew the intention of the teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee. It seemed that they did not want the students to risk their lives in the Crescent Prairie.The square became boisterous at this time. After reading the notice, the moment those horny students, including Zhang Tie, were to leave, a person walked towards Zhang Tie, and as he passed by, he walked into Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulder. With his spiritual energy having increased by sevenfold, Zhang Tie\u2019s senses were also sharp. The moment that person\u2019s shoulder bumped it to his, Zhang Tie sensed something new in his mining basket. If he was average like before, then he never would have noticed something new inside his mining basket, as the mining basket itself was already heavy and even had a hoe inside.Motherf*cker, how could they be that bored? Who\u2019s still doing childish pranks like opening my mining basket and throwing stuff inside at the sight of the mining basket on my back? I have already stopped playing that prank of throwing trash in other people\u2019s hood when I was eight years old. The moment Zhang Tie turned around to see who that bastard was, he heard someone shout loudly from several steps behind him.\u201cMy purse! Where\u2019s my purse? It was here just now, so how could it disappear in such a short period of time?\u201d\u201cThief! It must have been stolen\u2026\u201dF*ck! Zhang Tie\u2019s crisis mechanism was launched within 0.1 seconds. Sh*t, I was set up! F*ck those bastards who want to set me up by throwing that item into my mining basket. Since it was his mining basket, even if he had a hundred mouths, he would still not be able to clearly explain his innocence. When yellow mud fell onto one\u2019s crotch, it would still be regarded as sh*t, even if it wasn\u2019t. Once he was caught by those guys, it would be difficult for Zhang Tie to explain himself, thus he had to instantly leave, only then would he be able to gain the initiative of this battle\u2026Immediately, Zhang Tie\u2019s instinct to escape was deducted once again. Without even turning back, Zhang Tie had already surged forward with large strides like a leopard at almost the moment he heard the shouts as he ran towards the foot of the mountain with his maximum speed\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter that guy shouted, he felt spirited from having attracted the attention from those around him and was prepared to make a performance; however, when he raised his head, he realized that the brat in front of him had already disappeared. At the same time, the other helpers who were to surround Zhang Tie and capture him had also become dumbfounded. \u201cWhere\u2019s that brat? How did he escape? Weren\u2019t we just supposed to wait here and capture him along with the purse in his mining basket? Wasn\u2019t that what was supposed to happen? This doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d\u201cPurse, my purse\u2026\u201d This time, the man truly shrieked with a high pitch. Finally, by the time someone noticed Zhang Tie, he had already been over a hundred meters away and was running towards the downward path.\u201cThat brat is the thief! Hurry up and arrest him! Arrest the thief\u2026\u201d The square instantly became noisy as a great number of people rushed towards Zhang Tie\u2026Standing from afar, the corner of Samira\u2019s eye twitched. He had never expected that such a performance, which should have been very successful, would turn out like this. For commoners like Zhang Tie, if he realized that he was not the thief, encountering such an incident, wouldn\u2019t he simply turn around and have a look out of curiosity? But how could that brat escape even faster than a rabbit when he heard that shout? Was that a reaction a commoner would have? What kind of freak is that brat?\u201cPurse, my purse\u2026\u201d When he thought of his purse, Samira jumped up. \u201cBastard, that was my purse\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing the distance between him and the other people behind him gradually narrowing, Zhang Tie was forced to use all the strength he could muster as a soon-to-be LV 2 warrior to escape.Like a gust of wind, Zhang Tie, while carrying the mining basket, rushed towards the ore collection center below Wild Wolf Castle. At the sight of Zhang Tie dashing forward, a couple of people at the ore collection center hurriedly asked, \u201cZhang Tie, what are you running for?\u201d\u201cWashroom!\u201d Zhang Tie\u2019s voice reverberated from afar.After Zhang Tie was more than 50 meters away from them, several bodyguards who were responsible for the safety of the Samira Business Group arrived and shouted loudly, \u201cCatch that thief! That guy ahead of us is a thief! Hurry up, catch him!\u201dClosely following the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group was a group of students with a great sense of righteousness. In this fashion, a great number of people rushed by the ore collection center.\u201cThis is bad! I have to go report to the teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee and tell them that something is happening here!\u201d Noticing that something was amiss, a student who was acquainted with Zhang Tie told the others what he had to do before rushing towards Wild Wolf Castle.F*ck, is that brat\u2019s zodiac a rabbit? How could he run so fast? The group of LV 3 and LV 4 Samira Business Group warriors who were chasing Zhang Tie became shocked at his speed. Zhang Tie\u2019s speed was nothing like the speed a normal student should have; however, no matter how fast Zhang Tie could run, there was still a sharp difference between him and the other LV 3 and LV 4 bodyguards. The distance between them gradually shrunk from 100 m to 50 m, then 50 m to 20 m\u2026Gritting his teeth, Zhang Tie kept dashing forward as he cursed inside, \u201cF*ck, when I am powerful enough, I will definitely stomp you bastards to death one day!\u201d Seeing the mining cave in front of him, Zhang Tie became excited as he increased his speed and directly rushed into the mining cave.The sinister smile on the faces of the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group, which were becoming more and more pronounced, suddenly froze when they saw Zhang Tie drilling into the mining cave in front of them. Without any hesitation, they also hurriedly followed him in\u2026As Zhang Tie had gone inside this mining save several times over the past few days, he was extremely familiar with the paths inside. This time when he rushed inside, he didn\u2019t have time to ignite a torch, so he simply stretched out his right hand to get a feel for the wall and quickly moved based on his memory without showing any signs of having slowed his steps.Because the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group who were following him were not able to see in the darkness and were unfamiliar with the topography inside, after traversing a bit more than 20 m inside the cave, the man at the foremost front had already hit his head on the wall in a corner of the cave and made a shrill shriek.\u201cQuickly find a torch! Quickly find a torch! It\u2019s too dark inside! We can\u2019t clearly see him. The brat ran into the hole\u2026\u201dHearing the shrill shriek and the furious voice behind him, Zhang Tie, who slightly slowed down his steps, showed a trace of a cold sneer. Damn. You guys wanted to set me up, so this father will frame you back!The path inside this mining cave was very long and was about 1 km in length. After running for about 100 m, when Zhang Tie no longer heard the voices behind him, he searched for a torch in his mining basket. After igniting it, he continued to run inside to the place where he usually mined ores and was able to hear the \u201ccrack crack\u201d sounds made by the hoes hitting the walls. When he finally reached the mini cave on the side, he put out the torch and heavily gasped for air.At this moment, darkness was truly the color which could protect him the most.Zhang Tie heavily panted for roughly two minutes. After recovering his composure, Zhang Tie hurriedly closed his eyes and locked onto the mysterious arched door in his mind before entering the Castle of Black Iron.\u2026\u2026Within the Castle of Black Iron, it was bright and warm everywhere\u2026\u2014\u2014Handsome and Magnificent Castle Lord, welcome to the Castle of Black Iron!The same dialogue box with the same greeting appeared, but this time, Zhang Tie was not in the mood to read it in the least and instead poured out all the contents of his mining basket onto the ground. As expected, a delicate purse made from deer hide was found. As he took out the purse, Zhang Tie opened it and gave a casual glance at the contents inside. At the sight of more than 20 shiny gold coins and a handsome amount of silver coins, Zhang Tie laughed out loudly.Throwing the purse into the sundry box, Zhang Tie thought about it twice and decided to swap his dagger with the one that Donder had gifted him. Heaving a deep sigh, he exited the Castle of Black Iron.\u2026\u2026More than 10 minutes later, a great number of brilliant flames poured into the underground mines, causing it to turn particularly bright. At the sight of the burning torches, Zhang Tie sneered and began to mine for ores inside his own mining hole in the same rhythm as usual. It was only when the bright group of torches arrived at the mouth of his mining cave several minutes later did Zhang Tie put down his iron hoe. Tightening the grip on the dagger on his waist, he walked out of the hole calmly with a burning torch in hand as if nothing had happened.\u201cAhyaya, what\u2019s going on? Why are there so many people digging in the mines here today?\u201d Looking at the burning torches moving inside, Zhang Tie looked pretty shocked and exclaimed.\u201cBrat, we finally caught you. Obediently let us arrest you!\u201d said a man with a blue nose and a torch in hand. It was as if he had been ferociously punched by another person.\u201cWhat do you mean by \u2018obediently let us arrest you\u2019? Who the f*ck are you? I am mining here as usual, so why are you telling me to \u2018obediently let us arrest you\u2019? Zhang Tie gave a strange look before suddenly cursing loudly and ferociously.Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, the faces of the men with the burning torches in hand suddenly twitched.\u201cBrat, you\u2019re still going to argue? Just now, it was obviously that you were the one who had stolen my purse. We chased you from the square of Wild Wolf Castle all the way to here, yet you\u2019re pretending that nothing has happened? Everyone here could testify for us!\u201d another guy with a burning torch in hand said. This was exactly the person who had bumped into Zhang Tie in the square of Wild Wolf Castle.\u201cI stole your purse?\u201d Zhang Tie jumped up from the ground. \u201cI could steal your mom, your grandma, your sister, but I would never steal your purse. Although we are not in Blackhot City now, I could still report you to the Temporary Supervision Committee for slander!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t talk crap with him. Just take him down first!\u201d said the guy with the broken nose.\u201cWho the hell dares to touch me!?\u201d Zhang Tie instantly pulled out the dagger from his waist and ferociously glared at the people who wanted to move forward, causing them to be startled. They never expected Zhang Tie would use his weapon to fight back. After pulling out his dagger, Zhang Tie changed his expression and shouted towards the other horny students who had followed them in, \u201cFellow students, I am Zhang Tie, a student from Seventh National Male Middle School. Since these guys are disturbing my survival training by framing me for stealing a purse and are trying to forcefully arrest me, a bit later, if I stab them to death, then please be my witness. This is the only thing I can do to protect myself. Is there any brother among you that could help me go fetch the Temporary Supervision Committee!?\u201dSome students who had followed them in the hole immediately became flustered. \u201cAren\u2019t we here to capture a thief? Why does he look so confident?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you steal a purse in the square just now? We heard their shouts to capture a thief, so we followed them in. If you weren\u2019t the one who had stolen the purse, then why did you run?\u201d\u201cI had a stomachache just now and needed to go to the washroom. That\u2019s why I quickly ran back just now\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie explained as if it was true.Seeing the \u201cfact\u201d having deviated so much from the 'script\u201d, the group of people from the Samira Business Group became anxious, and one of the men had surged forward towards Zhang Tie and placed his hands onto Zhang Tie\u2019s shoulders, aiming to directly take Zhang Tie down.Seeing that guy confidently attacking him, Zhang Tie\u2019s eyes flashed with an icy glint. Instead of retreating backwards, Zhang Tie moved forward and directly stabbed his dagger towards the throat of that person as his blade shone in a shiny, icy light.Including all the other miners and the other bodyguards of the Samira Business Group, Zhang Tie\u2019s move had startled everyone. Such a move was truly sharp and ferocious. With his eyes fixed on that person\u2019s throat, Zhang Tie\u2019s move was extremely fast and precise. This simple set of gestures and basic dagger training were something that he had learned at school and was used with a sense full of unspeakable sharpness, braveness, and valor. The series of consistent moves could never be completed by a normal student; it was similar to the moves used by a veteran soldier on the battlefields who have been used to fights where one move would determine life and death.The moment Zhang Tie moved, the face of the bodyguard from the Samira Business Group who had tried to take him down twitched. Zhang Tie\u2019s reaction reminded him of the master sergeant that had taught him how to fight when he had just joined the army. Any move and fighting skill used by that master sergeant would be both aggressive and frightening. At this critical moment, that bodyguard had no time to change his move. Reluctantly, he lowered his body with his face facing the sky, resulting in a sharp breeze from Zhang Tie\u2019s dagger closely flying over his forehead\u2026Such a series of risky moves made everyone else exclaim\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWatch out\u2026\u201dSoon after the exclamations of the onlookers, Zhang Tie didn\u2019t pull back his right hand and had instead surged forward in front to the center of that person, using his left hand to complete a Hammer Punch, a skill from the Iron-Blood Fist Skill repertoire, onto that person\u2019s stomach.Hammer Punch was a very powerful skill that turned the impact of a punch to be one akin to a blow from a hammer.With a sound of a \u201cBang!\u201d, the man, who was off balance, was hit and was sent flying three meters back before falling onto the ground at the place where he had started his attack on Zhang Tie.All of a sudden, the entire mining cave became extremely silent; at this moment, even the sound of a needle falling onto the ground could be heard. Aside from the \u201cZi Zi\u201d sounds that came from the burning torches, nothing else could be heard. Everyone was staring at Zhang Tie with wide opened eyes as if they had seen a ghost. Among the onlookers, there were even some who couldn\u2019t believe their eyes and began to rub their eyes to make sure that what they had just seen was true. \u201cWas what we saw just now real? How could a student attending the survival training beat a Samira Business Group bodyguard, who\u2019s at least LV 3, and send him flying backwards? Are you kidding me?\u201d The onlookers couldn\u2019t believe their eyes., and at the same time, Zhang Tie also became slightly excited, as the moment he fought back against the bodyguard, he had realized that what he had practiced in the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit had finally shown its effects. It seemed that the dagger training he had done at school over the past three years had greatly improved after repetitive practicing in the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit. The moves that could only be described as normal were now ferocious and an applicable fighting skill. Luckily, what he could do in the Trouble-Reappearance Fruit could replicate in reality\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Ignoring the comments from the onlookers, Zhang Tie felt that his current gesture was heroic; however, in the eyes of those who knew fighting skills, they understood that this was the \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d that was always seen during dagger training. With the dagger behind him, this caused people to not know where the dagger was nor did they know whether the dagger was in his left hand or in his right hand. The dagger could also be put beside his waist, which frightened the others, as this increased the number of possible moves. This was the essence of the \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d. Sometimes, a sharp, hidden blade could be more frightening than a blade that was exposed in the sun.After the short fight, Zhang Tie stood there with this \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d, causing everyone to be shocked. Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s cool gesture, the eyes of the onlookers all shone. Now, even those who had doubted Zhang Tie\u2019s words had started to trust him. The reason was simple, and that was because Zhang Tie\u2019s Qi field and his status really matched with his \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d. Instead of showing your purity and heroicness, this move was used to hide your killing intent. Anyone who saw Zhang Tie\u2019s heroicness that was brought from his strong Qi field by his \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d would not believe that Zhang Tie was a thief. Everyone knew that a rhinoceros would never drill into a mouse\u2019s den. A person\u2019s spiritual energy and Qi field would leave the deepest impression on the hearts of others, and they were more persuasive than any words.\u201cSo this is the true Hidden Blade Move\u2026\u201d Some of the horny students among the onlookers mumbled as they cast their eyes full of admiration and worship onto Zhang Tie. This was the first time they had witnessed someone among the undergraduates attending the survival training applying a fighting skill that had been taught at school so skillfully. At this moment, the fellow named Zhang Tie had caused the eyes of many to shine; it was as if he had opened a gate, allowing them to enter a completely new world.All the horny students were startled, while the miners, who moved close to watch what was happening, became even more amazed. Although every one of the miners working here knew Zhang Tie, nobody could have expected that such an excellent \u201cwarrior\u201d was among their \u201cfellow workers\u201d. At the sight of Zhang Tie\u2019s performance, many of the miners instantly became confident and straightened their backs.The Samira Business Group bodyguard who had been hit by Zhang Tie quickly recovered his composure. Zhang Tie\u2019s strike just now did not make him lose his will to fight. Having seen the short fight, all the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group realized that Zhang Tie was a tricky fellow and that they would have to expend some effort in order to take him down.After exchanging glances, the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group came to a final decision.\u201cBrat, since you dare to fight back so ferociously, don\u2019t blame us for retaliating!\u201d solemnly warned a bodyguard who took a step towards Zhang Tie.\u201cEven now, you\u2019re still trying to frame me so despicably and are still trying to destroy by bright future and reputation. So why should this father treat you politely?\u201d Zhang Tie coldly glared at the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group who wanted to charge at him. \u201cBefore moving, I suggest you to think over this twice. Do you think it\u2019s worth risking your lives for that small bit of compensation that could barely allow your family to survive? Will the Samira Business Group feed you for the rest of your lives? I am only 15 years old. Have you considered what would happen if you try to create enmity with me over just a bit of compensation? I know you are smart, and we all know how things go. You are all just working for money, so I will warn you once again. Whoever dares to try to frame me as a thief again, this father will definitely kill him. I will see who will be killed first\u2026\u201dZhang Tie\u2019s ferocious words were more lethal than his \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d. Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s warning, the bodyguards who were about to surge forward instantly froze and became clear-minded; it was as if they had just been doused with icy water from head to toe. Right. Was it worth it to create a grievance with that brat just for a bit of compensation? Remembering his ferocious attack, his heroic character, as well as that frightening killing intent hidden within his \u201cHidden Blade Move\u201d, every one of the bodyguards realized one thing\u2014even if they could take down this brat now, could they take him down in the future? Since this brat was already this sharp at the age of 15, he would definitely be outside of their control in a few years. If they framed him today and ended up destroying his bright future and reputation, what would happen if this guy decides to take revenge on them in the future\u2026 The bodyguards, especially the one who had experienced Zhang Tie\u2019s fighting skills just now, were all shocked by his words. If they truly infuriated Zhang Tie, they might really not be able to eat and sleep well from now on.It was nothing special to set up an unlucky student in the way arranged by and paid by Samira; however, if that student was so ferocious that it could cause them to not even be able to sleep well whenever they thought of him taking revenge, then everyone involved would have to reconsider it. Although the small bit of compensation from the Samira Business Group was enough to force them to take action, if they had to risk their own lives and bright futures, then the amount of compensation provided was far from enough.After exchanging glances with each other, the bodyguards instantly learned what each of them had thought. It seemed that today\u2019s incident would never develop as Samira had planned. From the beginning, this brat had already known how this story would develop. Such a person had really terrifying intelligence and strength, and it would be better for them to not stir trouble with him. They really didn\u2019t know why Samira forced them to breed enmity with such a terrifying person.\u201cNo matter what, I realized my purse was missing the moment you ran. Since you were the most suspicious one, that\u2019s why we kept chasing you\u2026\u201d\u201cAre you idiots?\u201d Zhang Tie cursed loudly. \u201cYou can go to the railway station of Blackhot City to have a look around. Every day, many purses are stolen over there. Which thief would instantly run once they heard the shouts from the owner? If they had truly done that, then they would just be admitting to their actions. If you have low intelligence, then I will forgive you for insulting my personality, but you can not insult my intelligence! If you had truly lost your purse, then I will see which bastard among you will dare to tell the onlookers that I have stolen your purse? Which one of you bastards dare to frame me?\u201dAfter being cursed at by Zhang Tie, the bodyguards became less aggressive and could not even utter a single word; instead, they simply looked back at Zhang Tie in the same manner as he looked at them. If Zhang Tie had not displayed his strength, then what he had just said would have made him a laughingstock; however, the fact was Zhang Tie had already shown his terrifying strength and intelligence. Considering what Zhang Tie had said and done, the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group really lost the courage to breed enmity with Zhang Tie just for a bit of compensation from the Samira Business Group.\u2026\u2026\u201cBrother, could you tell me the name of that buddy? How could he be digging in the mines together with you?\u201d a horny student asked a miner who was beside him in a low voice.\u201cHe\u2019s Zhang Tie. He has already worked here with us for about 20 days\u2026\u201d As he said this, the miner looked at the person who had asked him the question with eyes full of contempt. Lowering his voice, he said, \u201cHis actions are within reason since he had even killed three wolves by himself before jumping into a pitch black hole that was as deep as 200 m in order to survive!\u201d\u201cWhat!? You\u2019re saying\u2026 he\u2019s that guy who was chased by seven wolves and had jumped into a pitch black hole in order to survive?!\u201d That person was really shocked by what he had heard. It turned out that Zhang Tie was not a normal student at all! He had long become a legendary figure.\u201cOf course!\u201d\u201cIf he was that sharp, then why did he choose to mine here?\u201d\u201cThis is a top secret!\u201d The miner rolled his eyes.\u201cWhat top secret?\u201d The horny student\u2019s eyes suddenly started to shine.\u201cThis secret isn\u2019t something that I would casually tell others!\u201dThe horny student gritted his teeth and pulled out 100 g of dried meat and tossed it to that miner. After receiving the dried meat, that miner whispered to him.\u201cWhat!? You\u2019re saying digging in the mines is the best way to cultivate? You\u2019re saying that Zhang Tie realized all this by digging in the mines? You\u2019re saying that Zhang Tie had, at the very least, improved his strength by a level by just mining in the caves these past few days?\u201d Hearing the secret, the horny student was really shocked by that top secret. It was truly too amazing.\u201cHuh, quiet. This secret was disclosed by Zhang Tie to the guys at the ores collection center by mistake. Don\u2019t let the others know!\u201d\u2026\u2026The horny student hurriedly nodded while the other surrounding horny students had long kept their ears alert by raising them in a manner akin to donkeys\u2026At that moment, with burning torches in hand, another group of people entered the mining cave. Seeing what was happening over there, they hurriedly made their way over.It was a teacher of the Temporary Supervision Committee and some students who were on duty in Wild Wolf Castle. Seeing the arrival of the teacher of the Temporary Supervision Committee, Zhang Tie and the bodyguards all heaved a deep sigh.\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHalf an hour later in the office of the Temporary Supervision Committee, Zhang Tie and the bodyguards of the Samira Business Group were standing in the middle of the room, while Captain Kerlin, Mr. Zerom, and the other teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee were sitting behind a row of desks. Aside from them, Samira was also sitting in a chair. At this moment, outside, the room was surrounded by students who came here to see how the story would develop.Miss Qili, who was responsible for the investigation, had inquired all the witnesses. Seeing the wisp of a smile on the corner of Zerom\u2019s mouth, Captain Kerlin became reassured.\u201cAccording to your testimony, the story has developed as follows: Jagla walked around the square of Wild Wolf Castle for more than half an hour before realizing that his purse had been stolen. At that moment, you saw Zhang Tie running away, so you took Zhang Tie as the thief who had stolen your purse. Is that why you called your people to chase Zhang Tie\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 That\u2019s how it was?\u201d The bodyguard from the Samira Business Group named Jagla admitted without any confidence.\u201cI will ask this once again. Among all of you present, did any one of you see how Jagla had lost his purse?\u201d Miss Qili asked. Everyone remained silent. When Miss Qili raised her voice and asked again, there was still no reply. At this moment, Zhang Tie, who had long been silently observing Samira, found the traces of a cold smile forming at the corner of Samira\u2019s mouth. The moment Samira was about to speak, Zhang Tie raised his hand. \u201cMiss Qili, I have a request. In order to avoid being framed by someone, I beg for your consent to allow me to return to Blackhot City to bring something back in the event that someone wants to testify that I was the thief.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Are you trying to stall for time?\u201d The guy in silky hat instantly became alert and asked.\u201cOf course not. As a pious follower of the Guardian God School, I deserve to be under the protection of the Guarding God School when I am being set up and insulted. I simply wanted to ask Grandma Teresa for one of the Guardian God School\u2019s Soul and Bloodline contract. For those among you that want to testify that I am guilty, please sign the contract and make a Soul and Bloodline oath. If your testimony is true, then would definitely have no reason to fear it and neither would it do you any harm. Using this method, I can avoid from being framed by a despicable person. Am I right, Boss Samira with triangular eyes resembling the head of a poisonous snake?\u201d\u201cPft!\u201d Miss Qili wasn\u2019t able to hold back from laughing out loud. Realizing her misconduct, Miss Qili hurriedly returned to her solemn look. The other teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee all looked really weird, as it was a challenge for them to hold back their laughter. Everyone turned their gazes to the man with the silky hat. At the same time, the other members of the Hit-Plane Brotherhood, who had just arrived outside the office, couldn\u2019t hold back and began to speak in weird voices as they mocked Samira\u2019s pair of triangular eyes.Samira\u2019s face turned purple. He stood up and pointed at Zhang Tie. \u201cBrat, who are you trying to scare!? You could never get your hands on the Soul and Bloodline contract. You\u2019re just trying to stall the proceeding!\u201d\u201cMy family has sold rice brew for dozens of years. Back when I was in Blackhot City, every week, I would send food to the orphans in the orphanage opened by Grandma Teresa. At the start, it was my father who sent it, then it was my elder brother, and now, I\u2019m the one who sends it. For pious followers who have pure souls and feel obliged to help others like us, I think that Grandma Teresa and the Guardian God would not like to see us being slandered by others. If you, Boss Samira, would like to try the effect of the Soul and Bloodline contract and do not fear being devoured by your lies, then you can just continue to try setting me up!\u201d Zhang Tie looked at Samira in disgust and spat towards him.Like colors being mixed on a palette, Samira\u2019s face was changing in color. At this moment, Samira had already long cursed Burwick\u2019s ancestors. Samira realized that Burwick\u2019s simple words, the one that said that Zhang Tie was the one who gave him trouble in public, was definitely a pit that waited for him to jump in by himself. If he had known that Zhang Tie was such a tricky guy, he would have never made such a rash decision; it was like beating a snake with a flyswatter. At this moment, Samira truly was full of regret.Earlier, Samira had planned to testify that he had seen Zhang Tie stealing that guy\u2019s purse, but when Zhang Tie mentioned the Guardian God School\u2019s Soul and Bloodline contract, he was startled. The Soul and Bloodline contract was not something that only belonged to the Guardian God School; many other schools also had this contract. The pious followers would cut their fingers and would write the Soul and Bloodline Oath using their fresh blood and their prayers. Based on the constraints of the oath, as long as your name was on the contract, you would be devoured by the mysterious force within the Soul and Bloodline Oath you had taken if you told a lie. In the entire Blackhot City, only during major trials would the Soul and Bloodline contract be used to test whether the witness\u2019 testimony was true or not. Samira could never have imagined that Zhang Tie would be able to get such an item. He had known the name of the grandma who was truly a pious follower of the Guardian God School, but never would he have thought that Zhang Tie was close to Grandma Teresa.Of course, Samira did not dare to bet his life on this trivial incident. After cursing inwardly a couple of times, he had no other choice but to sit back down in his chair with a solemn look.Seeing Samira staying silent with a solemn expression, Zhang Tie also heaved a deep sigh. Just now, he was just pretending to be confident. He had only heard of the Soul and Bloodline contract from others and was uncertain of whether or not he could get it. However, this was just like what Donder had taught him; when two brave men encountered one another on a narrow path, the braver man would win, but if two liars encountered one another on a narrow path, then the one with less confidence would be the first to retreat. As was expected, Samira was less confident than him. Thinking back to Fatty Donder\u2019s instruction, Zhang Tie sneered inside.\u201cI will repeat one more time. Is there anyone who had seen how Jagla\u2019s purse disappeared?\u201d Miss Qili asked one more time. After several seconds, there was still no reply.\u201cThen, the fact is clear. Jaglar, nobody had seen Zhang Tie stealing your purse nor is there any physical evidence found. At that moment when you realized your purse was missing, you saw Zhang Tie quickly running away, but according to Zhang Tie, he was simply\u2026 heading for the washroom\u2026\u201d As Miss Qili could not bear to say the words \u201crelieve his bowels\u201d described by Zhang Tie, after hesitating for a while, she changed it into another saying. \u201cThat\u2019s why you thought it was Zhang Tie who had stolen your purse and finally seeked for help in this office. But as there are no witnesses or any evidence, I declare that Zhang Tie is innocent!\u201dHearing the result, all the other members of Hit-Plane Brotherhood cheered outside.Rolling his eyes, Samira stood up impatiently. \u201cI object. Your words don\u2019t make any sense. There is a toilet outside of Wild Wolf Castle, so why did Zhang Tie not choose that toilet, which was closer to him, and instead choose the mine that is far away?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s simple. I had left my toilet paper inside the mining cave. If I want to relieve my bowels, of course I would have to go back to the mining cave. If I have taken a sh*t in Wild Wolf Castle, would I ask for your help to clean my butt, Boss Samira? Does your business group has such a service? Are you saying that you never clean your butt after relieving your bowls? Are you saying that you clean your butt using your fingers or just don\u2019t clean it at all like those barbarians? My sh*t is still fresh over there and could be used as physical evidence. Do you want to identify it for yourself, Boss Samira\u2026\u201d Zhang Tie sneered.Hearing Zhang Tie\u2019s counterattack, all the other horny students outside the door of the room burst out into laughter while Hista whistled crazily. The teachers of the Temporary Supervision Committee also held back from laughing out loudly. Captain Kerlin and Mr. Zerom\u2019s face both flushed red and expanded greatly, causing a weird expression to be seen on their faces. Many teachers directly buried their heads below the desk with shoulders heavily shaking. Even Miss Qili, who was responsible for the interrogation of this incidence, had her face become twisted.As expected, Samira was so infuriated that he even kept stomping his feet onto the ground. Pointing at Zhang Tie, he cursed, \u201cBastard! If you weren\u2019t the thief and the purse isn\u2019t with you, then why didn\u2019t you stop and explain it when so many people were chasing you?\u201d\u201cBastard\u2026 Bastard\u2026 Bastard\u2026 Son of a b*tch\u2026 Your brothers must have been shot onto your wall by your father masturbating and had dried on it, so why are you alive? Bastard, answer me. I\u2019m cursing you, so hurry up and admit that you are a bastard. What are you waiting for?\u201d Zhang Tie directly growled towards Samira. As a result, Samira looked pale and instantly sat back down in his chair. Everyone, both the people inside and outside the room, all stared at Zhang Tie with wide opened eyes. As Samira has never been cursed at by others since he was young, he pointed at Zhang Tie with a quivering finger and tried to ascertain what Zhang Tie had said. \u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026 What did you curse me as?\u201d\u201cI cursed you?\u201d Zhang Tie innocently pointed at his own nose with wide opened eyes. Blinking his eyes, he asked \u201cDid I curse you? I was just cursing that a bastard\u2019s brothers were shot onto the wall when his father masturbated and were sacrificed, all the while he was left alive. Are you saying that you are that bastard?\u201d\u201cBastard, of course I\u2019m not!\u201d Samira furiously replied.\u201cThat\u2019s right. Since you\u2019re not that bastard, then my cursing has nothing to do with you, right? There isn\u2019t any need for you to respond in such a way. Look, there are so many people in the room, so why are you the only one who looks so excited and is jumping from the ground. Unless\u2026 you are that bastard? That would explain your response just now. Have I mention your name just now?\u201d\u201cNonsense. I was not excited at all. I didn\u2019t make any response just now!\u201d Feeling that Zhang Tie was a tricky person, under the dubious eyes, Samira gritted his teeth and sat down, trying his best to be innocent as his eyes remained looking forward with confidence.Zhang Tie forced a smile. \u201cSo, Boss Samira, do you understand why I didn\u2019t stop running when those people were chasing me? It\u2019s because I am not the thief. There was no need for me to stop and give them a response because I had thought that they were chasing after someone else at that moment. I didn\u2019t give a response since I am innocent. If I truly gave any response, I would truly have been in trouble! Bastard, bastard, bastard, Boss Samira, why aren\u2019t you replying? Just reply. See? Since you aren\u2019t the bastard, you didn\u2019t reply and no one else here gave a response either. Do you understand now? What would I explain?\u201dHearing Zhang Tie\u2019s words, Samira\u2019s face was as black as ink. Glaring at Zhang Tie, he knew that this time, Zhang Tie had set him up in return and had realized that Zhang Tie was unexpectedly tricky. Thinking of his purse, Samira felt pain once again, as there were more than 20 gold coins inside the purse! My gold coins! Zhang Tie, you bastard! Just you wait!\u201cLeave!\u201d Followed by several bodyguards, Samira furiously stood up from his chair and prepared to leave, as he constantly felt restless here.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHold on, Boss Samira?\u201d Zhang Tie stopped Samira in a slow voice.\u201cSince you are already fine now, what else do you want!?\u201d Samira loudly shouted at Zhang Tie.\u201cThanks for your pardon. Since Boss Samira has said that I\u2019m fine now, then next, there\u2019s something you need to do!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Seeing Zhang Tie\u2019s confident smile, Samira suddenly felt as if something bad was about to happen\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
