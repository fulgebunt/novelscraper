    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1Far away from the shore, a private luxury cruise ship was moving slowly across the sea.The sea was like a roaring tiger, churning tumultuously just like Tan Aining\u2019s present emotions. She was extremely frustrated like a tiger.She was in a casual white T-shirt and jeans, standing on the very edge of the deck on the cruise ship. One step backward and she would directly fall into the deep sea.What was worse, her right shoulder and left thigh were bleeding after being shot. She was trembling and teetering, but still struggled to remain standing there.How brave and determined she was!Actually, two shots weren\u2019t severe enough to make Tang Aining tremble and teeter. She lost lots of strength because she had been drugged earlier.Otherwise, they could not have captured her that easily!A man and a woman were the heads of a group of people standing against her.The woman was in a white strapless dress with dark red curly hair, heavy makeup and looked seductive. Her eyes were full of joy.While the man, who was in a white suit, was around 30 years old and extraordinarily handsome.The two stood close to each other in ambiguous posture, seeming debauched.Behind the man and woman were seven or eight bodyguards, all in black suits.However, the man who was in white suit had an air of coldness. His eagle-liked eyes were fixed on Tang Aining who was standing right before him. The handgun aimed at her. He was ready to shoot.And the two shots to Tang Aining were from the man too.\u201cWhy?\u201d Tang Aining squeezed her voice out of her teeth. Her bloodshot eyes were full of endless anger, pain, regret and hope. She stared at the man and the woman who looked pretty close.\u201cWhy? Interesting,\u201d the woman, whose name was Tang Yaxin, snorted with laughter like she had heard a ridiculous joke. \u201cTang Aining, you still can\u2019t see it clearly, can you? To tell you the truth, I am the person Ziyue loves from the beginning to the end. And you were merely a tool to him. That\u2019s the reason why Ziyue was unwilling to sleep with you for the last two years!\u201d\u201cYou,\u201d Tang Aining choked. If sight could kill people, Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue, who were standing in front of her, would be chopped into pieces already.Tang Yaxin, Tang Aining\u2019s half-sister, was two years younger than Tang Aining.Ten years ago, due to the appearance of Tang Yaxin\u2019s mother, Tang Aining\u2019s mother had mentally broken down because of anger, encountered a car accident, and had been in a vegetative state till now. At the same time, Tang Yaxin together with her mother, the mistress, had entered the house.As for Tang Aining, she had been dumped by her father to a dark killer organization for training. And she had been doing many dirty deeds for the Tang family afterwards.Tang Aining was surely reluctant, but her mother was in her father\u2019s hand. As long as she dared to disobey, her mom would be killed.Qi Ziyue, although having an ordinary background, he was still outstanding. Tang Aining, who had always been clever but were deceived by that hypocritical man.Tang Yaxin, on the other hand, couldn\u2019t care less about Tang Aining\u2019s irritation. She continued. \u201cDad knows once your mother is dead, he\u2019ll lose control of you. Thus he deliberately sent men to chase you, to make you fall in love and be willing to do whatever he wants. Unexpectedly, you ignored so many men, but precisely chose my man because of an accident. And I had to sacrifice my man to act with you for Tang family\u2019s good!\u201dWhile Tang Yaxin was saying, she wore an upset face. Even though she was pretending, she was still attractive. Qi Ziyue, who was standing beside her, comforted, \u201cBaby, no worries, I\u2019ll stay by your side from now on, and I\u2019ll never leave you alone at night again.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. You, no matter your body or heart, belongs to me, and me only.\u201d Tang Yaxin replied in her coquettish voice, painting circles on Qi Ziyue\u2019s chest with her finger. She was flirting with him, which made the man sexually excited and distracted.If they hadn\u2019t been in the middle of something important, he would have pressed Tang Yaxin under his body and fucked her violently.Disgusting\u00a0. Tang Aining felt more disgusted than hurt by the scene.If she hadn\u2019t been aimed by a gun, she would never have allowed the two being so shameless before her eyes.\u201cYou,\u201d Tang Yaxin\u2019s expression changed upon hearing Tang Aining\u2019s words, but before she was able to argue back, Qi Ziyue interrupted, \u201cBaby, don\u2019t be annoyed. She\u2019s doomed. It\u2019s not a big deal to let her struggle by words.\u201dTang Yaxin calmed down after Qi Ziyue\u2019s explanation, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Actually, I don\u2019t want to deal with her at such an early stage, but she already found out her mother\u2019s death! Anyway, I have to say she has a really intimate relations with her mother. She even betrayed the Tang family, and you, for her mother.\u201dAfter a short break, Tang Yaxin added, \u201cTang Aining, since you\u2019ve done a lot for the Tang family, I\u2019ll give you two choices. One, you can jump down alone, and two\u2026\u201d Tang Yaxin wore a meaningful smile, \u201cTwo, you can have fun with my fellows, and enjoy the feelings from a girl to be a woman before your death, how\u2019s that?\u201dTang Aining clenched her fists, and her face turned displeased.She stopped struggling at the end, for now she had no choice but to die.Although she was able to hurt Tang Yaxin before her death, she also knew it clearly that if she had been caught, she would be humiliated and raped by all of those bodyguards, which was unbearable to her.So\u2026Tang Aining sneered at Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue, saying coldly, \u201cIf I will be alive, I\u2019ll definitely pay you back.\u201dTang Aining\u2019s words were like a curse. Tang Yaxin and Qi Ziyue felt threatened and chilly immediately as if the curse would come true one day, but before they could react, Tang Aining jumped into the rough sea directly.Tang Aining\u2019s body kept sinking downwards. She fell into unconsciousness gradually, but suddenly, she saw the jade pendant on her chest shine in red light, then she completely lost consciousness.\u2026City F, a third-tier city in this country.In a common patient room of the Central Hospital, there were four beds, but only the right one against the wall was occupied.On the patient bed was a girl, who was 17 or 18 years old. Her head was wrapped in gauze bandages. She was a pretty girl with beautiful features, but wore a solemn face, fixing her eyes at the news being played on the TV.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2The news was saying a female body had been found in the sea of City B last afternoon. The dead was around 25 years old. According to the investigation, the dead was exactly the industrial espionage and killer that the police was chasing after today.While watching the news, the teenage girl still seemed serious.Nobody knew the teenage girl\u2019s soul had already been coincidentally replaced by the soul of the female body on the news.Yes, Tang Aining had been reborn.Was that unbelievable, but it was what it was. Even Tang Aining, who was proud of her excellent adaptability, had spent a whole morning to accept and face the reality.But since God had let her be reborn, undoubtedly, she would fulfill her oath of the last lifetime\u2014if she could be alive, she would definitely pay Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin back.So, Qi Ziyue and Tang Yaxin, let\u2019s wait and see! Tang Aining was back. She was back for the Tang family who had killed her mother and used her for so many years.The body Tang Aining was reborn to named Gu Ning, 18 years old. She was born in a normal one-parent family, and her mother gave birth out of wedlock.Because of that, the mother and the daughter had been humiliated and disdained by their relatives for a long time. As for Gu Ning, she was always called \u201cthe bastard\u201d.Besides, the schoolmates despised, isolated and bullied her as well, which was the reason why Gu Ning was self-abased, introverted, weak and inarticulate.Gu Ning\u2019s mother, Gu Man, was a common factory worker due to her lack of a college degree, earning around several thousand yuan per month. They lived a very hard life.Gu Ning was a senior studying in a high school of City F. It was just a semester away from the National College Entrance Examination.However, Gu Ning was not academically inclined, so it was difficult for her to be accepted into college.And their relatives had laughed at them about that. Someone even pretended to persuade Gu Ning to marry a random man after the exam for Gu Man\u2019s good.But upon thinking of the reason why Gu Ning was in hospital, Tang Aining turned displeased with her eyes showed slight anger.Probably because they had encountered the same problem.Gu Ning had had a boyfriend before she was in hospital. They had dated for two months. Her boyfriend named Qin Zheng, a student in the top class.Qin Zheng was a handsome, outgoing boy, and also good at studying. He was born in a rich family. His father was the head of the tourism bureau, while his mother was a director of obstetrics and gynecology department in the hospital. Qin Zheng was a son of the authorities.It had been beyond Gu Ning\u2019s imagination that such an outstanding boy would have chased her. Most importantly, Gu Ning had secretly fallen in love with Qin Zheng for a year. Although Gu Ning had known they didn\u2019t match, she had been unwilling to reject. A few days later, she had accepted.But everything had come to an end right away yesterday.Yesterday had been a Friday. Qin Zheng had asked Gu Ning out for a meeting. Gu Ning had believed it must be a date, but to her surprise, Qin Zheng had appeared with Gu Xiaoxiao, and he had said he wanted to break up the minute they had met.Gu Xiaoxiao, the daughter of Gu Ning\u2019s uncle, was half a year Gu Ning\u2019s senior. While growing up, Gu Xiaoxiao had been instilled by her parents that Gu Ning was a bastard. Moreover, Gu Ning was more than beautiful than her. Thus bullying Gu Ning was always funny to Gu Xiaoxiao.\u201cGu Ning, Qin Zheng never liked you. He was with you only because it was a bet between us. I told him if he could have you to be his girlfriend for two months, then dump you, I\u2019ll be his girlfriend afterwards. So, from now on, Qin Zheng is my boyfriend.\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao had said in an arrogant way to Gu Ning.It had taken quite a while for Gu Ning to recover from the shock. She asked Qin Zheng, \u201cIs it true?\u201dQin Zheng, who had been looking at her with disdain, replied with intense dislike, \u201cAbsolutely. Gu Ning, do you really think I would like you, such a poor girl who has nothing? If it hadn\u2019t been for Xiaoxiao, I would not have bothered to give you a glance. You\u2019re disgusting.\u201dFor now, Gu Ning could barely stand.She had believed she had met her Prince Charming, but it had turned out to be an absurd joke.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t accept it. She had run away in shame, but had been caught by a car accident. Her brain had been badly damaged while bleeding endlessly, while the driver had escaped.When she was awake, she became Tang Aining.Right at this moment, two soft female voices sounded outside the door, and stopped Tang Aining from thinking.\u201cHere\u2019s 30 thousand. That\u2019s all the savings of me and your brother-in-law, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough for Ningning\u2019s surgery.\u201d This was Gu Ning\u2019s second aunt, Gu Qing. She sounded worried. After a few seconds, she continued, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you call our eldest brother?\u201dGu Qing said though, she didn\u2019t believe it herself.\u201cI already called, but our eldest brother said his money is all in his wife\u2019s hands. He\u2019s broke too. You know our eldest sister-in-law. Money is her life. One has to kill her first, then borrow her money.\u201dGu Man felt resigned. Gu Qingxiang, her eldest brother, was the richest one among the family, but also was the stingiest one. It was merely an excuse that his money was all in his wife\u2019s hands, and Gu Man knew it well.\u201cRight, how about our third brother?\u201d\u201cHe said he just bought a new house, and ran out of money. It\u2019s all my fault to let Ningning suffer with me. If Ningning couldn\u2019t recover, I\u2019ll commit suicide afterwards,\u201d Gu Man was in pain and desperation.Although Tang Aining wasn\u2019t the old Tang Aining any longer, she still had her professional skills with her. Thus she was able to hear the voices from outside clearly no matter how quiet they were.And the dialogue touched her.When she woke up this morning, she was busy absorbing the fact that she had been reborn, and she forgot to let Gu Man know she had already regained consciousness. Tang Aining felt guilty about that.Accompanied by a quick sound, the room door was pushed open. Two middle-aged women of the same age walked in. They were all in common, cheap clothes. Although their clothing was old and worn-out, it was clean and tidy.Because they didn\u2019t earn much money, they barely took good care of their skin. And they looked much older than their real age. No one would doubt if they said they were 50 years old.\u201cMom, Aunt.\u201dTang Aining opened her mouth first. She didn\u2019t feel uncomfortable, because she had totally accept the fact that she had been reborn.Firstly, she maintained Gu Ning\u2019s memories, which reminded her of the deep mother\u2019s love; secondly, she herself held great desire for a mother. Those were the reasons why Tang Aining swiftly accept Gu Man as her mother.Gu Man made her think of her own mother. Those two both had been abandoned by a man, but Gu Man was luckier than Tang Aining\u2019s mother.Though living a hard life, Gu Man was alive at least.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3But when Tang Aining, or Gu Ning opened her mouth, Gu Man and Gu Qing was surprised. They couldn\u2019t believe their eyes, seeing Gu Ning sitting against the head of the bed.The doctor had said there was congestion in Gu Ning\u2019s brain, and it must be removed by surgery, but now she woke up herself.\u201cNing, Ningning, you, you\u2019re awake\u2026\u201d although being surprised, Gu Man reacted soon. She burst into tears immediately, striding ahead, wanting to hug Gu Ning, but was afraid to hurt her. Thus Gu Man stood there instead, not knowing where to put her hands.\u201cNingning, you\u2019re awake. You\u2019re finally awake\u2026\u201dGu Qing rushed ahead as well. It was still unbearable for her, but she felt happy and excited.\u201cMom, aunt, I\u2019m awake,\u201d Gu Ning said, holding Gu Man\u2019s hands in hers to comfort her.\u201cRight, right. What a relief that you\u2019re finally awake!\u201d Gu Man cried out of happiness. She clutched Gu Ning\u2019s hands in case her daughter would disappear.Gu Qing was in tears of joy as well. Such a drama was a difficult test for normal human beings.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll go find the doctor,\u201d Gu Qing realized first, and ran out directly.Before long, the doctor walked in. He was also super surprised by the fact that Gu Ning was awake. What a magic!But it still needed a comprehensive check to make sure it was real.Therefore, the doctor arranged the exam for Gu Ning at once.After the exam, Gu Qing went to buy food for Gu Ning, while Gu Man stayed by Gu Ning\u2019s side to look after her.Gu Ning felt the strong mother\u2019s love from Gu Man.It was the first time that she had been taken good care of ever since her mother had been in vegetative state.Although when she had been with Qi Ziyue, she had heard of many sweet nothings, they were lies.After the meal, Gu Qing was gone for afternoon work. And Gu Man was free for today and tomorrow. She had applied to have the rest separate three days\u2019 break of this month together, when Gu Ning had been caught by an accident yesterday.Gu Man had talked with Gu Ning for a while before she told her to have a good rest.Gu Ning knew Gu Man hadn\u2019t had any sleep since last afternoon, so she let her catch up on some sleep on a nearby empty bed.Though Gu Ning was awake now, and Gu Man felt greatly relieved, she was still worried before the final result came out. So Gu Man was reluctant to take a break.But Gu Ning said if Gu Man didn\u2019t rest, she won\u2019t neither. Thus Gu Man agreed at the end.Gu Man was literally tired. She planned to lie down to comfort Gu Ning, but fell into a deep sleep in a few minutes.As for Gu Ning, she couldn\u2019t sleep at all. She\u2019s staring at the ceiling, thinking about what had happened during her last lifetime.All of a sudden, she saw a pair of feet walking by above her head. Gu Ning was astonished and had her mind back instantly, but there was nothing on the white ceiling.Why she had seen a pair of feet walking by above her head? Was it a hallucination?Gu Ning brought her eyes back from the ceiling. She rolled her body, focusing on the nearby bed where Gu Man was asleep. The woman had withered yellow skin with wrinkles all around her eyes and brow.Gu Man, who had been living a hard life, never bought herself any skincare products, fine food or expensive clothes.But she would try her best to give Gu Ning the best.Fortunately, Gu Ning was always a good child. Although she was self-abased and introverted, she won\u2019t compare with others because she knew her family couldn\u2019t afford.However, since Tang Aining was Gu Ning now, she wouldn\u2019t allow herself and Gu Man to stay poor and weak. Additionally, she was going to take revenge, and she must be powerful.She had ambition. Given that her enemy was the Tang family, she must be stronger than it.Although the Tang family was the third richest family in the capital, it was still a super rich family with billions of assets. And in a third-tier city, it must be the top one family.But the Tang family\u2019s glorious achievements relied largely on Tang Aining\u2019s effort.Tang Aining had done countless illegal things for the Tang Family, stealing opponents\u2019 confidential documents, killing people, for instances.But Tang Aining had destroyed all the evidence for her own safety the last lifetime. It was impossible for her now to find and use those evidence to accuse the Tang family.Once again, Gu Ning was distracted. She saw a person walking by a short distance away. Gu Ning was astonished again, and had her mind back at once.But there was nobody walking by, but a white wall before her. Was she really having hallucination?No, in addition to a person who was walking by, she had also seen a familiar door with a number plate said \u201c106\u201d.the room 106 was exactly the patient room that diagonally across hers.But, how was she able to see the door?Without a reason, she believed it wasn\u2019t a hallucination, but the truth.Unconsciously, Gu Ning looked back at the wall. She focused on it.After a while, the wall before her eyes became transparent. She could see the door of patient room 106, the patients who were walking about, the nurses and the doctors.Suddenly, a bold idea appeared in Gu Ning\u2019s mind.Was this clairvoyance?Gu Ning was struck dumb by this thought. She had a deep breath.To make sure whether it was clairvoyance or not, Gu Ning immediately moved her sight to another wall. The wall gradually turned transparent, then she saw what were in the room, the patient beds, the patients and the equipment.Now she was sure that it was clairvoyance.But Gu Ning still felt unreal. She wanted more proofs. So she looked around afterwards.All of a sudden, Gu Ning felt a sharp pain from her eyes, then she fell into unconsciousness.In the dream, Gu Ning dreamed herself was sinking after she had jumped into the sea, and the red light from the red jade on her chest.Then, she heard a distant light voice. The aged voice said, \u201cThere\u2019s an ancient jade named the \u2018Blood of the Phoenix\u2019. It\u2019s made of the blood of a phoenix and the soul of the earth. It has magical power, which enables you to live forever or be reborn.\u201dSuddenly, she woke up from her dream in surprise.What, what had happened?While Gu Ning was confused, a piece of information dawned on her.After a while, Gu Ning finally figured it out.The \u201cBlood of the Phoenix\u201d was made of the blood of a phoenix. Because it was an ancient object, it had a magical power. She could be reborn exactly because of this jade.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4In her previous incarnation, she had coincidentally picked up a phoenix-shaped red jade.Although she had no idea whether it was authentic or not, Gu Ning had kept it because of her fondness for it.Unexpectedly, the jade had magical power, which resulted in her rebirth.Moreover, Blood of the Phoenix had been absorbed into her soul, causing her to inherit the power of the jade, as well as a pair of Jade Eyes.Everything turned crystal clear in her pair of Jade Eyes.With that power, Gu Ning also gained the ability of clairvoyance and a photographic memory.Spirit Qi referred to a type of pure energy that existed in the myriad entities between the heavens and earth, akin to the essences of the sun and moon.There was also a telepathic eye space. It was a still storage room. One could put any (dead) object before their eyes into this telepathic eye space just by mere thought.Of course, all of those actions, or the use of Jade Eyes, cost the power.In addition, a person who had the power could live longer, and can use the power to cure injuries and illnesses.The space of telepathic eyes became larger as the power grew, and was able to accommodate more things.Because Blood of the Phoenix was a jade itself, it needed the power of jade.Jade consisted of nephrite and jadeite.Nephrites included traditional gems like crystals, corals, agates and so forth.Jadeites were mainly emeralds.As long as it has the power of jade, it would be of use.And jade was always popular and common, no matter in the ancient time or modern society.So, it wasn\u2019t difficult for Gu Ning to find jade.But, Gu Ning needed a large quantity of jade. Even she herself couldn\u2019t calculate the exact number.Thus stone gambling was the only way to satisfy Gu Ning\u2019s need. She needed to accumulate the power of jade for her Jade eyes.Since she had the Jade Eyes now, it was so easy for her to win the game of stone gambling.Only by stone gambling, she could win more and more jade to absorb purer and stronger power.At the same time, she could win money by stone gambling.And if she wanted to win money, she could use her Jade eyes in other ways.For example, playing dice cup. You could never fail by using clairvoyance.But, it couldn\u2019t last long, because a casino had its own rules. There was a limit of winning money. If one won too much money, his or her name would be on the blacklist, or he or she probably would be skilled.So if there was another way to make money, Gu Ning would not gamble, stone gambling surely excluded.Antiques were of great use as well, because antiques normally had a long history with the essence from the sun and the moon. If an antique had the essence, it would be an authentic one. The more essence an antique had, the longer time it must had been existed for.Stone gambling could make you a billionaire or a beggar overnight. Antiques had the same effect. If you accidentally got an authentic one, you would be super rich at once, otherwise you would lose every cent you had.But for Gu Ning, who had gained magical power, those were merely problems.On thinking of that, Gu Ning was more than excited. The magical power she had was so immensely powerful!If she still couldn\u2019t achieve anything with the Jade eyes, she would rather die.The scare was also replaced by happiness, for money was easily accessible to Gu Ning now. As for the Jade eyes, it was acceptable too.\u201cNingning, Ningning, are you alright?\u201d hearing the worried voice form Gu Man, Gu Ning immediately got her mind back. She looked at Gu Man\u2019s face, which was full of concern, \u201cMom, you\u2019re awake?\u201dSeeing Gu Ning was fine, Gu Man was relieved, but still slightly concerned, \u201cI\u2019ve been awake for a long time, but you seemed distracted. I\u2019ve called your name for several times. You wouldn\u2019t react. I thought your brain was damaged again. You\u2019ve sacred me!\u201dUm.After Gu Man\u2019s explanation, Gu Ning felt a little ashamed, \u201cWell, I just too concentrated on my thoughts.\u201dGu Man didn\u2019t ask any further. She only wanted to see Gu Ning was fine.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re awake, that\u2019s all I want. It\u2019s almost six pm. What do you want to eat? Let me buy for you,\u201d Gu Man asked.\u201cI\u2019m not picky. Anything is fine for me,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201c\u2026\u201d Gu Man opened her mouth for a second, but didn\u2019t say a word.She knew Gu Ning was a good child, who would not indulge herself for expensive food. Then, Gu Man decided to make the decision for Gu Ning, and buy her some delicious food.When Gu Man was gone, Gu Ning got off the bed to walk around as exercise.But when she had just walked a few steps away from her patient room, a doctor who was walking fast with a white coat and mask, knocked her down. Gu Ning stumbled and almost fell. Luckily, she caught the wall at once, and kept her balance.Gu Ning was displeased at first, but then she thought the doctor probably was in an emergency, and didn\u2019t knock her down on purpose. Gu Ning planned to forgive him.But to her surprise, the man who had knocked her down didn\u2019t apologize at all, and even glared at her, then rushed away.Gu Ning was struck dumb for a second, not because the man didn\u2019t apologize and glared at her, but because she had noticed the strong hatred in his eyes. The hatred was not for her.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t help but turn around. Her eyes squinted. The man was weird.All of a sudden, Gu Ning saw a gun hidden in the man\u2019s waist through his white coat.Gu Ning was worried.\u00a0Why would a doctor carry a gun with him?And the man seemed he was not a plainclothes police, but an avenger.Although it had nothing to do with Gu Ning, she couldn\u2019t step aside since she had found out the truth.If the man was really for revenge, innocent people could be hurt once he shot.On thinking of that, Gu Ning couldn\u2019t allow herself to ignore.She wasn\u2019t the God, nor the Virgin Mary, but she wasn\u2019t cold-blooded neither. And she was willing to help as long as she could.Therefore, Gu Ning followed up quietly.Gu Ning followed the suspect to an office. When he was about to walk in, a young female doctor, who was in a white coat too, walked out, but was stopped by the suspect.Gu Ning fixed her eyes on the movements of the suspect. The suspect pulled out the gun the minute the female doctor appeared in his sight. The gun aimed at her.Due to the white coat, the gun wasn\u2019t obvious.But the female doctor\u2019s face was as white as a paper now. She was scared.Then the suspect talked to her for a while, and the female doctor reluctantly followed him to another side.Gu Ning followed up immediately.They went upstairs. There were few people in the corridors, because most of them used elevators. And nobody noticed there was something wrong with them.They went straight to the top of the building. It was an open balcony.There was no one else on the balcony, except the suspect, the female doctor and Gu Ning who was hidden in the dark.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Gu Ning didn\u2019t get involved at once. She decided to observe for a while, waiting for a perfect timing.The suspect held the gun, aiming at the female doctor. They were so close. If Gu Ning couldn\u2019t catch the suspect quickly, he might feel threatened and shoot, which would cause bad result.Gu Ning glanced over the open balcony. There was a pile of miscellaneous goods at the right side of the exit. Gu Ning used it to cover herself, and moved closer to them.\u201cYang Hao, what, what do you want?\u201d facing the gun, the female doctor was trembling.\u201cWhat do I want?\u201d the suspect, Yang Hao, snorted. Then he said angrily with his eyes full of fierceness, \u201cAn Qian, it\u2019s all because of you that I end up like this! What do I want? The hospital has fired me. My wife left me for another man. It\u2019s you, It\u2019s all because of you\u2026\u201dSpeaking of this, An Qian felt aggrieved. She argued, \u201cThat\u2019s all because of your immoral behaviors. As a doctor, you disobeyed the basic rules. You\u2019ve secretly accepted the money from the patient\u2019s family, and ignored a life. I simply rescued a person.\u201d\u201cShut up. That\u2019s my own business. You don\u2019t have any right to interfere, \u201cYang Hao snapped. His hand around the gun tightened, \u201cNow, have someone transfer five million yuan to my account, or I\u2019ll shoot.\u201dAn Qian was trembling with fear. She swallowed down with great force, \u201cI-I don\u2019t have that much at all, but I have two million yuan.\u201d\u201cNo, I want a total five million yuan. That bitch left me exactly for that amount of money. I\u2019ll grab her back with the same amount of money.\u201d Yang Hao seemed crazily excited, and was likely to shoot.Meanwhile, with the cover of the miscellaneous goods, Gu Ning had moved to Yang Hao\u2019s back, two meters away from him. Seeing Yang Hao being emotionally excited, Gu Ning was startled. She was worried that he would shoot by accident.Yang Hao was unusually excited now, intending to do evil things.What Yang Hao had done today was illegal. Even if he could get five million yuan today, he still would be punished by the law. He wouldn\u2019t have chance to win his wife back.Besides, his wife wouldn\u2019t come back to him neither.And the other man, who had given Yang Hao\u2019s wife five million yuan must be a man of great wealth. If Yang Hao\u2019s wife had left him for money, she certainly wouldn\u2019t leave a wealthy man for him.Even if Yang Hao\u2019s wife didn\u2019t care about the money, Yang Hao was a suspect now. He would be caught and put in jail sooner or later. If Yang Hao\u2019s wife chose to stay by his side, she would lose both Yang Hao and the money.Gu Ning was now worried An Qian would say something that would irritate Yang Hao. The man could lose his control and shoot. Then, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t have chance to save her.Fortunately, An Qian was smart enough to notice Yang Hao was emotionally excited. She softened her voice and comforted, \u201cNo problem, I\u2019ll transfer five million yuan to you, but I only have two million yuan on my account, and I need to call my family for the rest.\u201dAs long as she could survive, she would pay five million yuan for it.She believed the police could catch Yang Hao later.Gu Ning thought otherwise. Yang Hao wasn\u2019t dumb to let go of An Qian. If he did so, An Qian must call the police afterwards.Accordingly, even if Yang Hao could get the money, he couldn\u2019t get away with it.Hearing An Qian agreed at the end, Yang Hao was relieved, \u201cGreat, but you have to use the speaker.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d An Qian pulled out her phone, trembling still.Yang Hao seemed a little tired after holding the gun for a long time. He loosed his hand.Right at that moment, Gu Ning seized her chance. She rushed out rapidly to Yang Hao. The latter was knocked down on the floor directly, due to his lack of preparation. The gun in a loosened hand was thrown out as well, and fell down several meters away.It all happened too fast. An Qian was struck dumb without knowing her phone was dropped on the ground.But it was not the end yet. Without the gun, Yang Hao was merely an opponent to Gu Ning. Before he could fight back, Gu Ning hit Yang Hao into unconsciousness.In case he might be awake later, Gu Ning found a rope and tied him, plugging his mouth with a rag.\u201cCall the police!\u201d Gu Ning looked at An Qian, who had no idea what to do.\u201cOh! Right! Right!\u201d An Qian finally got her mind back, and found her phone was missing. She stood still for a while before finding out her phone was lying on the ground. She immediately picked it up.But before she could dial out, her phone rang. An Qian was startled.She saw the caller\u2019s name, and answered it at once, \u201cHi, Dad.\u201d\u201cQianqian, where are you now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m at the open balcony of inpatient department\u2026\u201d An Qian told her father what had happened, then she asked, \u201cDad, shall I call the police or?\u201dGu Ning frowned. She didn\u2019t understand why An Qian said that. What else did she want to do except calling the police?\u201cWhat? How is this possible? Are you alright?\u201d An Qian\u2019s father was extremely worried. His heart was in his throat now.\u201cDad, I\u2019m fine now.\u201d An Qian replied.\u201cWait for me. I\u2019ll be right there. And, do not call the police now.\u201d An Qian\u2019s father said. An Qian agreed, then hung up the phone.Gu Ning had good hearing. She had heard clearly what An Qian\u2019s father had said. When An Qian finished her call, Gu Ning asked with puzzle, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you call the police?\u201d\u201cBecause If I called the police, the whole hospital would know it. The people would be alarmed, which is the last thing I want to see.\u201d An Qian explained.Gu Ning thought it was reasonable, so she closed her mouth.An Qian added, \u201cBut, Yang Hao will definitely be sent to the police station, in private. I\u2019ve already recorded the dialog between us. His fingerprints were also on the gun, which is the proof too.\u201dRecorded?Gu Ning now was respectful of An Qian. Being in such a dangerous situation, she was still able to record.\u201cBy the way, thank you so much for saving my life.\u201d An Qian thanked Gu Ning sincerely. She drew out a check and a pen from her clothing, writing on it for a second, then gave it to Gu Ning, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you actually. This is a check for \u00a5500,000. Please take it.\u201dGu Ning stared at the check. She frowned. Although she badly needed money now, she wasn\u2019t willing to accept the check.She had her own principles. Since she had given out a helping hand on her own initiative, she didn\u2019t ask for payment. Gu Ning refused with determination, \u201cI didn\u2019t save your life for money. Please take this check back.\u201dAn Qian was surprised.But she didn\u2019t doubt whether Gu Ning rejected the check because it wasn\u2019t enough, she felt the kindness from the young lady instead.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6An Qian didn\u2019t want to embarrass Gu Ning, so she took back the check.But since Gu Ning had saved her life, she also felt uncomfortable doing nothing.Thus, after An Qian had taken away the check, she pulled out a name card, handing it to Gu Ning, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to take the check, then let\u2019s be friends. This is my name card. If you need anything in the future, please feel free to call me. As long as I can help, I\u2019ll spare no effort.\u201dCompared with money, network was more precious actually. Gu Ning didn\u2019t reject this time.Not because she was greedy, but An Qian just wanted to make friends with her. If she disagreed again, she would seem arrogant.Moreover, she needed friends and a network. Gu Ning didn\u2019t think too highly of herself. She believed a network would be helpful.Of course, she wouldn\u2019t make people do things for her. It was totally up to the others\u2019 will.\u201cGreat, then I\u2019ll take it,\u201d Gu Ning accepted the name card without further ado.Seeing Gu Ning accept the card, An Qian immediately reached out her hand, \u201cNice to meet you. My name\u2019s An Qian.\u201dGu Ning held her hand at once, \u201cNice to meet you too. I\u2019m Gu Ning.\u201dThis was how they officially met.\u201cSorry, I have to go now. My mom will be worried if she can\u2019t find me. Please don\u2019t tell the police that I\u2019m involved. I don\u2019t want to get into any trouble.\u201d Then before An Qian could reply, Gu Ning turned around and left.\u201cHey,\u201d An Qian wanted to stopped Gu Ning. She hadn\u2019t had her phone number yet!But Gu Ning walked too fast. When An Qian ran to the entrance of the stairs, Gu Ning was already gone.But Yang Hao was still there, An Qian couldn\u2019t leave, so she gave up.Several minutes later, there was someone appeared on the open balcony. The head was a middle-aged man in a white coat. He was about 50 years old, and followed by two male doctors, who were around 30 years old.\u201cQianqian, are you alright?\u201d The middle-aged man rushed to An Qian once appeared. He asked with worries.\u201cDad, I\u2019m fine,\u201d An Qian replied.\u201cGreat. That\u2019s great.\u201d An Qian\u2019s father was finally relieved, seeing An Qian was safe.He then glanced over the open balcony. There was only Yang Hao, who was still unconscious on the ground, and nobody else. An Qian\u2019s father asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the girl who has saved your life?\u201d\u201cOh! She\u2019s gone in case her mother would be worried. And she also doesn\u2019t want the police to know her involvement. She doesn\u2019t want to get into trouble.\u201d An Qian told her father what Gu Ning had said.\u201cDid you thank her?\u201d An Qian\u2019s father asked again.\u201cI gave her a check for \u00a5500,000, but she wouldn\u2019t accept. Then I handed her my name card to make a friend. She accepted at last.\u201d An Qian answered.An Qian\u2019s father was surprised too. He now felt more respectful than grateful to Gu Ning.Actually, even if Gu Ning had taken the money, they wouldn\u2019t have blamed her for that, because she indeed had saved An Qian\u2019s life.The An family knew to be thankful. If Gu Ning asked for more money, they would give it to her without delay.Gu Man had come back to the patient room earlier than Gu Ning. She didn\u2019t find Gu Ning, and was concerned at once. She dropped a bag of apples, going out to search for her daughter, but the minute she left the patient room, Gu Ning was back.Gu Man knew she was being overreacted, so she didn\u2019t blame Gu Ning.It was a peaceful night. The second morning, Gu Ning\u2019s report was out. It said Gu Ning was healthy and was ready to leave the hospital.Seeing the result, Gu Man was greatly relieved. She packed up immediately, preparing to go home.\u201cGu Ning, I\u2019m here to visit you.\u201d Right at that moment, a female voice sounded outside the door.It was An Qian.Gu Ning was a little, but not very surprised. Due to what had happened yesterday, it was normal that An Qian would visit her.And it was easy for An Qian to find out which room she was in, because An Qian worked in the hospital.When Gu Ning had gone yesterday, An Qian then realized Gu Ning, or her mother, must be a patient in this hospital.Or, probably she and her mother were here to visit another patient.If Gu Ning was a patient, she could ask the information desk.If Gu Ning\u2019s mother was a patient, then it would be impossible for An Qian to find them, because she had no idea what was the name of Gu Ning\u2019s mother.If they were merely visitors, An Qian thought she might better give up.When An Qian had went back to work and passed by the information desk, she had asked her colleague whether there was a patient named Gu Ning.To her surprise, she was right. So she went to visit her this morning.\u201cMiss An, welcome,\u201d Gu Ning stood up and welcomed her.\u201cThis must be your mother,\u201d An Qian looked at Gu Man.\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cNice to meet you, Gu Ning\u2019s mother. My name\u2019s An Qian. I\u2019m Gu Ning\u2019s friend,\u201d An Qian greeted Gu Man.Actually, An Qian was confused about how to call Gu Ning\u2019s mother.Gu Man was around 40 years old, while she was 27. Gu Man was merely 10 years her senior. If she called Gu Man \u201cAunt\u201d, Gu Man was younger than her aunt.But if she called Gu Man \u201cSister\u201d, it was inappropriate neither, because she said she was Gu Ning\u2019s friend.Gu Ning was 18 years old, and 10 years her junior. If she let Gu Ning call her \u201cAunt\u201d, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t accept, and she wouldn\u2019t neither.Because she wasn\u2019t that old to be called aunt.It was an embarrassing age! An Qian hoped she had been in her early twenties.If she had been in her early twenties, she would have been young and free, and wouldn\u2019t be worried about getting married soon.But she didn\u2019t have a boyfriend now, how could she get married! Besides, she wanted to enjoy her single life for a few years longer. She didn\u2019t want to marry someone that soon.Fine, she was going too far.Although there was a 10-year age gap between her and Gu Ning, she didn\u2019t feel Gu Ning was a teenage girl, but a mature woman like her instead.Probably that was precocity.\u201cNice to meet you, Miss An,\u201d Gu Man greeted An Qian. Though she was puzzled why Gu Ning had a friend who was much older than her, Gu Man didn\u2019t bother to think further.She didn\u2019t limit the freedom of Gu Ning to make friends. She only wanted Gu Ning to have her own principles.\u201cThis is for Gu Ning. Hope she could recover soon.\u201d An Qian gave her gift to Gu Man.\u201cThank you so much, Miss An! I don\u2019t know how to thank you for that.\u201d Gu Man was slightly embarrassed, because she knew the gift wasn\u2019t cheap.But she took it at the end for it\u2019s a gift from a friend. She didn\u2019t want to reject the kindness.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d An Qian wore a smile.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Gu Man put away the gift into an end-table by the bed, then handed a cup of water to An Qian.\u201cThank you so much,\u201d An Qian took the water and thanked politely.\u201cGu Ning, how\u2019s your body?\u201d An Qian asked.\u201cOh, I\u2019m fine now, and ready to leave,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cReally?\u201d An Qian was happy for Gu Ning, \u201cCongratulations!\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Gu Ning said.After a while, An Qian walked Gu Ning and her mother out of the hospital.Gu Man knew An Qian was working in this hospital, she didn\u2019t want to bother An Qian, so she disagreed.But An Qian insisted, so Gu Man accepted her offer.While on the way out, An Qian had already called the taxi for them. Gu Man couldn\u2019t thank An Qian enough for what she had done.As for Gu Ning, she was at ease though, but she still thanked An Qian out of politeness.When Gu Ning finally left the hospital, she felt super free and comfortable.After half an hour, the two were home at last.Gu Ning and her mother lived in an old alley at the old district. It was too old and about to be demolished sooner or later.Therefore, Gu Ning and her mother wouldn\u2019t stay here for much longer.This house was the property of Gu Ning\u2019s grandparents. When her grandpa had passed away 10 years ago, her grandma moved to live with her eldest uncle, Gu Qinxiang.And the house became the home of Gu Ning and her mother.But they needed to pay the rent.Since they were family, Gu Ning and her mother only needed to pay half of the rent.It was an old area in the old district with old amenities, so the rent wasn\u2019t high.The house had two floors. Each floor was around 40 square meters. The first floor was living room, kitchen and bathroom, and there were three rooms on the second floor.In the past, when the Gu family had lived together, Gu Ning\u2019s grandparents had shared a room, her eldest uncle, Gu Qinxiang, and third uncle, Gu Qinyang, had shared another, while the third room was shared by Gu Qing and Gu Man. It had been extremely crowded.Then, Gu Qinxiang became rich and bought another house. Gu Qinyang had got a cradle-to-grave job with a house allotted by his company. The Gu family had lived a better life afterwards.But this old house had been left with some basic furniture, without any household appliances.Gu Ning was astonished to know that her family was dirt poor.Tang Aining, in her previous incarnation, had never ever lived such a miserable life.Luckily, Gu Ning didn\u2019t feel hopeless, but satisfied, because she had the strong deep love from her mother.She wanted to earn money as soon as possible to let Gu Man live an affluent life.The first thing Gu Ning wanted to do after she earned money was to buy a big house, then buy some good clothes and expensive skincare products for Gu Man. She wanted her mother to enjoy her life.Gu Man wasn\u2019t an old woman actually. She was only 39 years old. There were a lot she could do for the rest of her life.For 18 years, Gu Man had stayed single.Gu Man was pretty indeed, and had many admirers, but she didn\u2019t want Gu Ning to feel uncomfortable, so she never agreed to marry again.Since Gu Ning had grown-up now, probably it is time for Gu Man to chase for her own happiness. So Gu Ning made up her mind to find her mother a good man in the future.As for Gu Ning\u2019s biological father, Gu Man never talked about him. Even their relatives had no idea who he was.All Gu Ning knew was that Gu Man got pregnant when she was just 19. Gu Man had been in her second semester as a freshman in her college, then she dropped out of her school and gone home.At that time, the Gu family were all astonished by the fact. It was beyond their imagination that the most docile girl in their family would have done such a bad thing.It was a great humiliation to them. They all agreed to have Gu Man abort the baby.Gu Man was unwilling to abort her child. To keep her baby, Gu Man left her family, and worked outside on her own.It had been a hard time. Gu Man hadn\u2019t successfully got any job due to her pregnancy, and Gu Qing had taken care of her.Gu Ning\u2019s grandpa had been alive at that time, and he had always loved Gu Man, his youngest daughter, so he had brought Gu Man home at the end.During the time when Gu Ning\u2019s grandpa had been alive, Gu Ning had been under the care of her grandpa, while Gu Man had worked hard to earn money.Since Gu Man had lived in her parents\u2019 house, her income had always been used by the whole household.Ten years ago, Gu Ning\u2019s grandpa had passed away. Her grandma had moved to live with her eldest uncle, Gu Qinxiang.Gu Qinxiang and Gu Qinyang had been unwilling to let Gu Man occupy their parents\u2019 house, so they had persuaded their mother to ask for rent.\u201cNingning, have a rest on the bed first. I\u2019ll cook now. And don\u2019t forget to change your clothes. I\u2019ll do the laundry later.\u201d Gu Man said.\u201cMom, you can cook, and let me do the laundry.\u201d Gu Ning felt sorry for Gu Man, who was skinny and always reminded her of her mother from the last lifetime. She wanted to do something for her.\u201cNo, you\u2019re the patient,\u201d Gu Man disagreed.\u201cI\u2019m fine now,\u201d Gu Ning argued.\u201cI said no,\u201d Gu Man pretended that she was mad.\u201cFine,\u201d Gu Ning gave up.Half an hour later, the meal was ready.Because they lived a poor life, the meal was very simple. They didn\u2019t have meat normally, except today, because Gu Ning had just left the hospital.During the dinner, Gu Man kept sending the meat into Gu Ning\u2019s bowl, while herself didn\u2019t have a piece at all.Gu Ning was moved and about to cry. Actually, Gu Man now needed nutrition more than Gu Ning.\u201cMom, there\u2019s enough meat. Please have some yourself. It\u2019s hot today, and we better not leave it to the night. It will be smelly.\u201d Gu Ning immediately gave Gu Man several pieces of meat.Gu Man surely knew what was on Gu Ning\u2019s mind, but she didn\u2019t reject because she didn\u2019t want to hurt her daughter.However, she felt sad in her heart.She blamed herself for being unable to provide her daughter a good life.After dinner, Gu Man urged Gu Ning to take a rest in her room. Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to lie down, but to hang out on the antique street.She wanted to try her Jade eyes and win some money.Gu Ning took out her savings of 500 yuan and her ID card, \u201cMom, I want to have a walk, and I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201dGu Man was worried, because Gu Ning had just left the hospital, \u201cBut, you need a rest now. You just left the hospital.\u201d\u201cNo worries, mom. I\u2019m fine now. A walk and the sunshine are good for my health as well.\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Gu Man was still slightly worried.\u201cMom, I\u2019m not a little girl anymore. I\u2019ll take good care of myself. And, I have my phone with me. You can call me if you\u2019re worried,\u201d Gu Ning said to comfort her mother.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8At the end, Gu Man compromised, \u201cThen you must be cautious, and call me once you feel uncomfortable.\u201d\u201cI will,\u201d Gu Ning answered, then went outside.When Gu Ning was out on the street, she looked at her phone in her hand with intense dislike. It was a cheap old phone.To be honest, Gu Ning was used to smartphones, and she disliked the old one with buttons on it.I\u2019m going to make money and buy my mom and myself a smartphone.\u00a0Gu Ning thought to herself.There was no direct bus from where Gu Ning lived to the antique market, so she decided to transfer from the downtown.Luckily, it wasn\u2019t the rush hour, and it only took Gu Ning 20 minutes to arrive at the downtown.Gu Ning stepped off the bus, and walked ahead for another 300 meters to get on the next bus to the antique market.There were many jewelry stores of well-known brands around the downtown.Gu Ning was attracted by the jade shown in a window of a nearby jewelry store. She wanted to walk inside and take a look.Although she knew how to absorb the power, she hadn\u2019t practiced yet, and was curious about the feeling.But when she just entered the store, she heard an acid female voice, \u201cWow! Isn\u2019t this Gu Ning? What? You dare to walk in a jewelry store when you have no money to feed yourself?\u201dYes, when Gu Ning was at school, she was known for her poverty.Though Gu Man gave her allowance every day, which was enough for her meals, she was used to saving as much money as she could, and normally ate a steamed bun as her dinner.That was how she had managed to save 500 yuan.The girl who had verbally abused Gu Ning named Shao Feifei. She was Gu Ning\u2019s classmate. Back in the classroom, Shao Feifei had always laughed at Gu Ning. She would hurl abuse at Gu Ning, throw garbage into her desk and even ruin her textbooks.The reason why Shao Feifei hated Gu Ning so much, not because Gu Ning was from a poor family, but because Gu Ning was more beautiful than her. Shao Feifei, who was so-called \u201cthe Prettiest Girl\u201d among the students was super jealous of Gu Ning.Gu Ning was merely a poor girl from a poor family. How could she be more beautiful than Shao Feifei!And there was another girl of the same age stood beside Shao Feifei, but Gu Ning had no idea who she was.Everyone in the store turned with one accord, looking at Gu Ning. Those well-educated ones stayed calm, while those who were arrogant wore a face with dislike.Especially when Gu Ning showed up in her worn-out clothes, it was a humiliation for the rich people to be in the same place with the poor.But Gu Ning ignored all of them except Shao Feifei, \u201cThis isn\u2019t your home. Why couldn\u2019t I be here?\u201d she argued.\u201cWell, can you afford anything here?\u201d Shao Feifei laughed at Gu Ning, then wore an exaggerated face with surprise, \u201cGee, do you plan to steal something?\u201dAt that time, everyone\u2019s look on Gu Ning changed, especially the workers who were alert. They obviously believed what Shao Feifei had just said.Gu Ning was annoyed, \u201cShao Feifei, you don\u2019t have any proof for that, and I can sue you for libel.\u201d Her eyes were full of coldness.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShao Feifei was scared by Gu Ning\u2019s look at first, then was even more astonished Gu Ning had argued back.In the past, no matter how Shao Feifei had laughed at Gu Ning, Gu Ning had always stayed quiet.\u201cSister, let\u2019s go now,\u201d The girl who was with Shao Feifei felt threatened. She wanted to leave right away.\u201cWhy? I\u2019ll stay and see what can she afford,\u201d Shao Feifei raised her voice. She didn\u2019t want to run away in front of Gu Ning.In her eyes, Gu Ning was merely a poor student without any power, wealth or support.Then she looked at Gu Ning with aggression.\u201cI don\u2019t think I have to buy something just because I\u2019ve walked in,\u201d Gu Ning argued again.\u201cIf you aren\u2019t going to buy anything, then you shouldn\u2019t have walked in,\u201d Shao Feifei insisted.\u201cI want to have a look first, and it\u2019s none of your business,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Shao Feifei had no idea how to fight back.Gu Ning then ignored her, walking by directly.Though those rich people disliked the poor, nobody stopped Gu Ning.Just like what she had said, you didn\u2019t have to buy something just because you had walked in.But all the workers in the jewelry store kept their eyes on Gu Ning, like she were a real thief.Actually, there were many monitors in the store, and all the jewelry were locked in thick and heavy glasses. It wasn\u2019t easy to steal a piece of them.Gu Ning felt uncomfortable under the suspicion, but she didn\u2019t say a word.She went to the area of jade, and focused on them. Seconds later, there was a layer of light white fog appeared above those jade, and the fog was exactly the power Gu Ning needed.However, the fog was thin, which meant the jade wasn\u2019t good enough.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care at all, but the glasses blocked her out from those jade. She could only absorb the power without anything in the middle.Thus Gu Ning had to give up. She sighed slightly.But her sigh drew attention again.\u201cThe poor can\u2019t afford a piece of jade, and all they can do is sigh. Poor little thing,\u201d a woman said.\u201cExactly, the poor can never afford a piece of jade throughout their whole life!\u201d another woman agreed.Gu Ning was speechless. Whatever the poor had done, it was wrong.But how could they be so sure that she wasn\u2019t able to buy it throughout her whole life? She was poor for now, but it didn\u2019t mean she couldn\u2019t afford an expensive commodity in the future.Gu Ning looked to those two women. They were around 40 years with good appearance. Both were in luxury dresses, a little over though.Especially the right one, there were three diamond, gold and jade rings around both of her two fingers.And a gold bracelet around one of her wrist while a jade bracelet around another one.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Around her neck, there was a platinum necklace with a large jade.And her gold earrings were also too big to ignore. The woman was apparently showing off her wealth.But after a while, Gu Ning couldn\u2019t help but snort with laughter.The woman\u2019s face changed a little with anger, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d\u201cYou, of course! Since you\u2019re so rich, why are you still wearing a cheap fake bracelet and jade,\u201d Gu Ning replied plainly.Yes, the bracelet and the jade around the woman\u2019s wrist and neck were fake. Gu Ning had intended to absorb the power of the woman\u2019s jewelry, but had failed, because they weren\u2019t authentic.As for the gold, Gu Ning barely know, but the jade ring around the woman\u2019s fingers was authentic though.Gu Ning understood the woman probably had no idea that most of her jewelry weren\u2019t real. She did it on purpose to pay the woman back.Gu Ning admitted that she wasn\u2019t tolerant, and she wouldn\u2019t stay quiet any longer.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d the woman was irritated. She felt embarrassed at once.Those jewelry were from her husband, who was a super rich man. How could they be fake!And in front of her was just a poor girl, who knew nothing at all!\u201cGee! Shut your mouth. You\u2019re being jealous.\u201dGu Ning stayed calm instead.\u201cBelieve it or not, there\u2019s a jewelry appraiser in every jewelry store. You can try it yourself. And now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I have something else to do.\u201d Then Gu Ning turned around and left.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The woman didn\u2019t want to let the go of Gu Ning, but was stopped by another woman beside her, \u201cLet it go, she\u2019s merely a poor girl. We better stay away from her.\u201dThe woman immediately put on airs, behaving like she was a real royalty.She said to Gu Ning\u2019s back with disdain, \u201cI don\u2019t care you poor people at all!\u201dThen, she focused on the jade again.However, Gu Ning\u2019s words stayed in her mind, and she wanted to identify them herself.On the other side, Shao Feifei stood at the entrance of the jewelry store, waiting for Gu Ning. She had also witnessed everything that had just happened inside.Seeing Gu Ning going out, Shao Feifei criticized, \u201cIsn\u2019t it interesting? You can\u2019t afford a piece yourself, and you\u2019re so jealous of the rich.\u201d\u201cIf you can afford it, why don\u2019t you buy a piece?\u201d Gu Ning argued.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShao Feifei felt humiliated, because Gu Ning had hit the point.Although Shao Feifei was born in a rich family with millions of wealth, she still couldn\u2019t afford on her own.The jewelry cost dozens of thousand yuan each, while she only had a monthly allowance of several thousand yuan. Besides, she spent much every month, and had no money left for a piece of jewelry.She had been here today only because her birthday was around the corner. She wanted to choose her birthday gift, and her mother would buy it for her.Gu Ning ignored Shao Feifei, and left.Although Shao Feifei disliked the feeling of failure, she had no idea how to fight back again.Shao Xue, who was Shao Feifei\u2019s cousin, held her breath in case Shao Feifei would vent anger on her, which had happened before.Shao Xue did this only because her family needed the sources from Shao Feifei\u2019s family.Gu Ning went straight to the antique market after she had left the jewelry store.It took her half an hour on the bus to get to the antique market from the downtown. When she finally arrived, it was about three pm.The antique market, also known as \u201cthe Old Market\u201d. Only the old and ancient objects were called antiques.The antique market had been popular for many years, and there were many people visiting the antique street. Most of them were middle-aged men or the elderly.Gu Ning barely saw young people on the street, especially a female student of her age. Even though there were teenagers, they were either accompanied by their parents, or hanging around.So when Gu Ning walked by the stands, nobody paid attention to her.At the both sides of the street, there were countless stands with numerous commodities. However, authentic antiques were still rare.Both antiques and the jade were business of high risk. The unspoken rule in this industry was \u201cNo Anti-counterfeiting\u201d. You paid and got the commodities on-site without any after-sales service.If you were lucky enough to get an authentic one, you would be rich overnight, otherwise, you would be broke.Gu Ning walked slowly, because she felt exhausted after she had used her Jade Eyes for a short time. She needed to take a break before going on.Along her way, Gu Ning hadn\u2019t found out a single authentic object. She was disappointed.The antique market had existed for too long to leave any authentic pieces for her.Gu Ning felt she was naive to try to earn money by antiques.There were many choices for stone gambling though, but most of the stones came from Burma and Province Y, and there were less quality stones in other cities.Anyway, it wasn\u2019t easy to find a perfect stone.City F was far away from Burma, and it cost too much for Gu Ning to fly to there.Though the flight ticket wasn\u2019t very expensive actually, it was a lot for Gu Ning and her mother.And the last thing Gu Ning wanted to happen was for her exceptional ability to be revealed. She didn\u2019t want her mother to know as well. So, even Gu Ning was willing to go to Burma, she was short of a good reason.Gu Ning didn\u2019t maintain much hope in City F, but she still tried to find some. As long as it was a real gem, she would take it.In the end, when Gu Ning was ready to leave, an object on a not noticeable stand got her attention.It was a bracelet consisted of 12 blocks of china. Each block was as big as a toe. There were many stains and dirt around it. It didn\u2019t have a good appearance, but Gu Ning saw a layer of light white fog from it.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10If it had the power, it must be an authentic one. Gu Ning was happy, but didn\u2019t show her happiness on her face.Gu Ning walked to the stand. The stand owner ignored her because she was a teenage girl in an ordinary clothing, and seemed poor.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care though. She pointed directly at the bracelet, \u201cHow much is this one, please?\u201dThe stand owner took a glance at the bracelet, then frowned with disdain.Why? Because in his eye, this bracelet was fake. He even intended to throw it away.But since there was a buyer for it, he opened his mouth, \u201d 50 yuan.\u201dFifty yuan were merely much, but it was still a lot for Gu Ning. However, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t willing to miss any chance to win money.She didn\u2019t want to show her real intention at the very beginning, so she bargained, \u201cCould you please sell it for a cheaper price? I\u2019m just a student with less money.\u201d\u201cThen 40 yuan, that\u2019s all.\u201d The stand owner agreed. He still believed the bracelet was a worthless junk.Gu Ning pretended to hesitate for a second, then said, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll take it.\u201dThen she gave money to the stand owner.The stand owner took the money and gave the bracelet to Gu Ning.Gu Ning went straight to the appraisal center with the bracelet afterwards.She went to the appraisal center not to identify the bracelet, but for money. Only with money that she was able to do other things.There was a monthly large fair in the antique market with many visitors. In a normal day, many visitors would come and make deals, but the price wouldn\u2019t be high because dealers were not adequate.When Gu Ning arrived at the appraisal center, there was already someone in there to identify antiques. Bystanders stood around. Someone were here just for fun, while some were here for the results. If there was a real one, they would bid.Those appraisers were all experienced, and the appraisal center had its own rules. If it was a fake one, they would not charge for it. If it was a real one, then you need to pay for the service. If the antique was sold on-site, the service price would be higher.The rules were quite acceptable.Gu Ning walked to the table of appraisal. There was a appraiser in the middle of identification. It was a delicate snuff bottle, and looked like an authentic one.Gu Ning used her Jade eyes. She didn\u2019t see any fog around it. It was fake.\u201cIt\u2019s fake.\u201d It only took the appraiser around 10 minutes to have the result.\u201cWhat? It\u2019s fake?\u201d A male voice sounded in shock among the crowd. The man wore an astonished face, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! How could it be fake!\u201d\u201cAre you questioning me now?\u201d The appraiser wasn\u2019t happy to be questioned.The man explained at once, \u201cNo, no, but it\u2019s an heirloom from my grandpa to my father and to me. I can\u2019t accept it\u2019s fake.\u201dThe rest of the people in the center showed their sympathy.\u201cBro, even if it\u2019s an heirloom, it could be fake.\u201d\u201cTrue!\u201d\u201cProbably your grandfather had made a mistake. It\u2019s quite normal.\u201dOthers echoed.The man wore a displeased face. He left swiftly with his heirloom. He had believed it must be a real antique, and wanted to sell it, but to his surprise, it was fake.Then, there were more fake ones, but no one felt disappointed because the owners didn\u2019t pay much for their \u201cantiques\u201d.\u201cHi, could you please identify this bracelet for me?\u201d It was Gu Ning\u2019s turn. She handed over the bracelet she had just bought.Gu Ning\u2019s appearance raised discussion among the crowd.\u201cGee, where did she get this dirty thing? It\u2019s so ugly.\u201d\u201cThis little girl must be crazy about money. It\u2019s apparently fake.\u201dOthers echoed.Gu Ning ignored all of them.\u00a0Let\u2019s see\u00a0. She thought to herself.Though the appraiser didn\u2019t believe it was real neither, he did his work though.When he took the dusty bracelet over, he almost hated it at the first look. However, while he was cleaning the stains by a napkin, the real color of the bracelet appeared.It was white and blue in random order, and it was made of china.The appraiser frowned a little. He thought it was merely a modern artwork. In the ancient time, no one would use china to make bracelet.But since he had begun, he decided to finish his work.Then, he kept on cleaning the bracelet. After a while, he felt something was unusual.Others asked immediately.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIs it real?\u201dThe appraiser stayed silent, focusing on his work. Before long, the bracelet was clean and shiny.Everyone now discovered that the bracelet was made of china. All of them were assured that it must be fake, because no one had ever heard a china bracelet could be made in the ancient time. It must be a modern artwork.While the appraiser thought otherwise. He now was astonished and super excited.\u201cThe china is blue and white porcelain from Ming and Qing Dynasty.\u201d He suddenly said.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dEveryone was shocked.Blue and white porcelain from Ming and Qing Dynasty. Then, it was a real one?Though blue and white porcelain in Ming and Qing Dynasty wasn\u2019t as expensive as in Yuan or Tang Dynasty, it wasn\u2019t cheap at all.All of a sudden, everyone looked at Gu Ning in jealousy. Instead, Gu Ning was as calm as usual, which made people wonder that she had known it already.Actually, Gu Ning only knew it was real, but had no idea what it was exactly.\u201cIt is blue and white porcelain from Ming and Qing Dynasty. I suppose the original one is broken, and somebody has made it into a bracelet.\u201d Or, no one would intentionally break a valuable blue and white porcelain to make a bracelet.\u201cHey young girl, where did you get this bracelet?\u201d someone asked.\u201cI just bought it from a normal stand,\u201d Gu Ning told the truth.\u201cWhat? You picked it up by accident? What a lucky girl!\u201dEveryone agreed.\u201cYoung girl, do you want to sell it? I\u2019ll give you 30 thousand.\u201d A middle-aged man in a suit made a bid without any delay.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11\u201cThirty thousand? Are you kidding? I\u2019ll give you 50 thousand, young girl.\u201d\u201cSixty thousand,\u201d another man bid.\u201cSeventy thousand.\u201d\u201cEighty thousand.\u201d\u2026\u201cOne hundred and twenty thousand!\u201dEveryone was shocked again. One hundred and twenty thousand for a blue and white porcelain bracelet from Ming and Qing Dynasty was way too much.Gu Ning was shocked as well. This was her first time to sell an antique. She knew antiques were expensive, but the price was still a great surprise to her.She thought forty thousand would be high enough, because the power of this bracelet wasn\u2019t strong. It wasn\u2019t worth too much because it had a short history.One hundred and twenty thousand meant nothing for Gu Ning in her last lifetime, but for now, it was a huge amount of money.In the end, Gu Ning sold the bracelet for 120 thousand yuan.Although everyone felt surprised by the high price, only experts knew this bracelet was worth much more than that in the market.A bracelet made of blue and white porcelain from Ming and Qing Dynasty, even from a broken one, was expensive.Nowadays, a blue and white porcelain plate from Ming and Qing Dynasty was worth millions of yuan. The price of this bracelet wouldn\u2019t be lower than 200 thousand in the market.Though Gu Ning wasn\u2019t experienced, and had no idea how much exactly this bracelet was worth, she wouldn\u2019t regret.She needed money right now, and had no time to wait for a more generous buyer.Besides, she didn\u2019t know how to put this bracelet into the market.There was a designated bank in the antique market. One needed to go to the bank for the money.Gu Ning didn\u2019t have a bank card, but her ID card, so she had one bank card on-site.When she had received the money, she gave the bracelet to the buyer, and the service fee was transferred to the appraiser afterwards.The service fee ranged from hundreds to thousands. It depended on the seller.What Gu Ning had earned wasn\u2019t much in the antique industry, so she only needed to pay two thousand yuan.But Gu Ning was generous, who directly paid the appraiser 10 thousand.When she had left the bank, Gu Ning felt she was targeted.The antique street wasn\u2019t a safe place with all kinds of people around. It was quite normal that she had become someone\u2019s target as soon as she had earn a large amount of money.Gu Ning calmed down. She left the antique street without any delay.The minute Gu Ning had left the street, several men, who had been stalking her rushed ahead to stop her.Four hoodlums around 20 years old surrounded Gu Ning.The others all ran away in fear, and no one was willing to help.\u201cGive us all your money, or I\u2019ll teach you a lesson.\u201d The head of those hoodlums, who has yellow hair threatened Gu Ning.\u201cOh, how?\u201d Gu Ning squinted, like she couldn\u2019t care less.And the onlookers were surprised by Gu Ning being so calm.Wasn\u2019t she scared? Was she pretending? Or, did she think anyone would help?Those hoodlums were notorious around this area, and no one dared to be involved.\u201cDon\u2019t ever hope that someone would help you. Let me tell you, no one dare to. Just give me your money!\u201d The man in yellow hair threatened once more.Gu Ning knew no one would help her, because everyone had run away. However, she was confident she could easily beat those bad guys.\u201cTake it by yourself if you want.\u201d Gu Ning challenged him.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Those hoodlums was irritated at once.\u201cGreat. Beat her!\u201d The man with yellow hair ordered.Then, two hoodlums ran to Gu Ning, trying to catch her.But before they could come near her, Gu Ning kicked one man in the stomach. The man fell down on the ground in pain immediately.Then, Gu Ning turned to another one, and punched him directly. The latter suffered at once.The other two hoodlums were in shock now. It was beyond their imagination that a teenage girl could be so violent.All of a sudden, a boy who rushed out nearby attacked the man in yellow hair. The man fell down instantly.The only one, who was left alone standing there, escaped right away. Unfortunately, he ran too fast to recognize the direction, and hit a pole, then bounced back to the ground.Gu Ning laughed out loud by this funny scene.Right at this moment, the boy who had attacked the hoodlum in yellow hair ran to Gu Ning. He said in excitement, \u201cGu Ning, it is really you! I thought I was wrong. Wow, you\u2019re so good and beat down two men easily.\u201dGu Ning knew this boy. He was a senior from the top class in their high school. His name was Mu Ke.Mu Ke was nearly 5\u201911\u201d tall. He was a handsome and good-looking boy.Gu Ning and Mu Ke were from different classes. She knew Mu Ke was Qin Zheng\u2019s classmate and they were good friends. Mu Ke also knew the truth behind she and Qin Zheng\u2019s relationship.But Mu Ke was different from his friends. He was a good upright boy, and even told her secretly that Qin Zheng wasn\u2019t her Mr. Right.But back then, Gu Ning had loved Qin Zheng so much. She wouldn\u2019t listen to anyone else.Thinking of that, Gu Ning actually held a great opinion of Mu Ke.\u201cThank you so much, Mu Ke.\u201d Gu Ning smiled to Mu Ke, and thanked him sincerely.Though she was able to deal with it all on her own, Mu Ke had helped her indeed. She ought to thank him for that.Gu Ning was a beautiful girl. She seemed ordinary only because she spent less time on appearance.Gu Ning\u2019s smile had made Mu Ke flush.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. And I think even though I didn\u2019t helped you, they couldn\u2019t hurt you at all.\u201d Mu Ke was a little shy before Gu Ning.\u201cAnyway, thank you so much for helping me.\u201d Gu Ning said.Suddenly, Mu Ke remembered something important. He looked at Gu Ning with astonishment, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard Qin Zheng has broken up with you on Friday, and then you\u2019ve caught by a car accident. How are you right now?\u201dMu Ke had no intention to hurt Gu Ning\u2019s feelings. He really cared about her.But he hadn\u2019t been there in person, so he had only heard of it.He believed it was Qin Zheng\u2019s fault, but he had no right to get involved in his friend\u2019s personal relations.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Gu Ning\u2019s face changed a little, but not because of Mu Ke. She knew Mu Ke cared about her.Thus Gu Ning asked him back for fun, \u201cDo I look like I\u2019m in a bad condition?\u201dUm.Mu Ke was struck dumb. Gu Ning was absolutely fine and well. She seemed like nothing had happened at all. Or, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to knock down two grown-ups.\u201cThat\u2019s great, and now you know what kind of a person he is. So\u2026\u201d Mu Ke intended to tell Gu Ning to give up any illusion on Qin Zheng, but he thought it wasn\u2019t his business after all.\u201cIt\u2019ll never happen again. I\u2019ve already given up on Qin Zheng.\u201d Gu Ning knew exactly what was on Mu Ke\u2019s mind. She didn\u2019t care at all.\u201cGreat to hear that,\u201d Mu Ke felt relieved.Mu Ke wasn\u2019t in love with Gu Ning actually. He just hated to see an innocent girl be bullied.\u201cIt\u2019s late now. I have to go home,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSure, bye-bye,\u201d Mu Ke replied.Since Gu Ning had made a lot of money today, so she took a taxi to go home.Gu Ning wanted to buy a smartphone at first, but it was too late for that. She didn\u2019t want Gu Man to be worried, so she got home directly.Indeed, Gu Man called her once when she was halfway, while it took Gu Ning another 20 minutes to be home.The taxi line was shorter and faster than a bus, so Gu Ning had spent only 40 minutes on her way home.A half less time than the bus.When Gu Ning had arrived at her home, it was almost six pm. Gu Man had already prepared the dinner.Gu Qing\u2019s family were here today too. They came to visit Gu Ning because she had just left the hospital.Gu Ning\u2019s uncle named Jiang Xu, and her cousin called Jiang Xinyue.\u201cNingning\u2019s home.\u201dThe minute Gu Ning walked in, Jiang Xu and Gu Qing welcomed her.\u201cAunt, uncle and Xinyue, nice to meet you all,\u201d Gu Ning greeted them.\u201cSister, nice to meet you too,\u201d Jiang Xinyue greeted Gu Ning. She was a shy girl.Jiang Xinyue was 15 years old now. She was a third grade student in middle school, and a quiet girl of few words. Luckily, she wasn\u2019t as self-abased as the old Gu Ning. She was academic and had lots of friends.Among the young generation in the Gu family, Jiang Xinyue only liked Gu Ning. For the rest, she had seen them through.Jiang Xu was two years Gu Qing\u2019s senior, 45 years old, but looked older than his real age. He worked as a truck driver in a construction site. It was a labor work.Jiang Xu earned thousands of yuan every month. With Gu Qing\u2019s salary, they lived a better life than Gu Ning and her mother.However, the family of Gu Qing still lived on a tight budget. They were not able to buy a house, but lived in a rental one.Though City F was a third-tier city, the house price wasn\u2019t low, especially in the downtown.Even in the suburb, it cost at least hundreds of thousand yuan to buy a house for the whole family to live.Jiang Xu\u2019s parents had passed away for a long time, so he didn\u2019t need to support his parents, but it was still very hard for him to save enough money because of expenditure on renting and tuition.So it was a sky-high price for them.As long as they had food to eat, clothes to wear, and their child could go to school, they felt happy.Although the family of Gu Qing lived on a tight budget, they would help Gu Ning and Gu Man whenever they could.When Gu Ning had been in hospital, the rest of the Gu family had ignored. Even when Gu Man had called them to borrow money, they all had rejected.Only Gu Qing and Jiang Xu had visited Gu Ning. Moreover, they had given Gu Man all of their savings to help Gu Ning with the surgery.Fortunately, Gu Ning had recovered at the end.Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to tell Gu Man that she had earn a lot of money. She wanted to wait till she could afford a house.And she surely would never forget the family of Gu Qing. She would also help them to live a good life when she became rich in the future.Thinking of that, Gu Ning opened her mouth suddenly, \u201cMom, aunt, and uncle. I promise I\u2019ll let you live a good life when I become successful in the future.\u201dEveryone was surprised by Gu Ning.No matter if it was going to be true or not, they felt happy that Gu Ning cared about them.And Gu Ning had just grown up, her future was still unpredictable.\u201cGreat. We\u2019ll wait till the day come. Ningning, we believe you can be successful.\u201d\u201cExactly, we all believe you.\u201dGu Qing and Jiang Xu was moved, and encouraged Gu Ning at the same time.Gu Man then found out Gu Ning had changed. She was more outgoing now than before.Because they really loved each other as family, they had a good time that day.Lying on the bed before falling asleep, Gu Ning took out her notebooks to read.Though Gu Ning was a good student in her previous incarnation, but not excellent enough. It was harder for Gu Ning in this incarnation to get into college. So, Gu Ning had to spend more time and energy on studying.She opened her notebooks, reading them ten lines at one sight. The content had all deeply borne in her mind.The Jade Eyes was really extraordinary.\u2026The second day was Monday.Gu Man had already call Gu Ning\u2019s head teacher for a few days leave due to her accident. Though Gu Ning was fine now, Gu Man still wanted her to stay at home.But Gu Ning believed otherwise, she wanted to go the school.Gu Man agreed at the end.Gu Ning had encountered Shao Feifei yesterday. She didn\u2019t want her head teacher to know that she had recovered but wasn\u2019t willing to attend the classes.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care about the difficulties. She just didn\u2019t want to get into any more trouble.The first class was at 6:50 am. It took Gu Ning around 20 minutes to get to her school by bus. Normally, Gu Ning would get up at six o\u2019clock in the morning.Gu Man went to work at half past eight, because the factory wasn\u2019t far away. It took Gu Man half an hour on her way to work, so she left home at 7:40 am.Thus, to let Gu Man have more sleep, Gu Ning never eat breakfast at home, but would have all her three meals at her school. She only went back home when the last class had been finished.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Gu Ning had a weekly allowance of one hundred yuan. It wasn\u2019t much, but for Gu Ning it was a lot.When Gu Ning left her home, Gu Man gave her one hundred yuan.Though Gu Ning had a lot of money now, she didn\u2019t want anyone to know that. She took the money from Gu Man as usual.Gu Ning didn\u2019t take the bus, but ran to her school.Because Gu Ning wasn\u2019t in good health, she needed to exercise. Gu Ning decided she would run to her school from now on, except on rainy days.The No.3 High School of City F was a normal high school.There were five high schools in City F. Only the No.1 High School was excellent, and the rest were all common.Gu Ning had run for half an hour when she arrived at her school.Gu Ning was weak indeed. Half an hour of running made her exhausted.Gu Ning wanted to be strong, but she also knew it will take time to achieve her goal. So, she didn\u2019t want to push herself too hard. She wanted to accomplish it step by step.Gu Ning had left her home earlier, so it was still 20 minutes before the first class. She decided to have her breakfast first.She went to buy her breakfast, and finished on her way back.\u201cGu Ning?\u201dThe second Gu Ning walked into the teaching building, a male voice called her with uncertainty.Gu Ning frowned tightly, because she knew who this familiar voice was. It was Qin Zheng.She looked over. It was Qin Zheng indeed.Qin Zheng was around 5\u201911\u201d tall in a white T-shirt and jeans. He was a very handsome athletic boy, and popular among the girls.But what he had done to Gu Ning was so shameless.\u201cWhat?\u201d Gu Ning stayed emotionless, like the boy was merely a stranger to her.Actually it was the truth. Though she had all the memories of Gu Ning, she was Tang Aining after all. Except Gu Man and the family of Gu Qing, the rest were all strangers to Gu Ning.Even those relatives in the Gu Family, she wouldn\u2019t care about them.Qin Zheng was the cause why Gu Ning had died, but Gu Ning had been reborn now. She had no intention to take revenge on him.If they wouldn\u2019t find her any trouble, she would let it go, but if they would, Gu Ning would fight back.Seeing Gu Ning, Qin Zheng was greatly surprised. Hadn\u2019t she been caught by a car accident? Why she looked so good now?Due to his astonishment, Qin Zheng didn\u2019t realize Gu Ning\u2019s attitude towards him had changed. He asked, \u201cAre, are you alright?\u201dThough Qin Zheng didn\u2019t like Gu Ning, he felt guilty about her accident.\u201cAnd then?\u201d Gu Ning asked back.\u201cWhat?\u201d Qin Zheng didn\u2019t understand, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dGu Ning snorted with laughter. She looked at Qin Zheng like he was an idiot, \u201cQin Zheng, are you blind? Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m standing here right before your eyes? I\u2019m fine! Leave me alone!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dQin Zheng was displeased at once, because he had been humiliated. However, he was more surprised by Gu Ning\u2019s change. She was so brave and straightforward now, which was totally different from the old self-abased quiet Gu Ning.Was this because of the car accident? She had changed a lot.Yes, the soul had been exchanged, and the personality had changed as well.\u201cWhat?\u201d Gu Ning said calmly, like she hadn\u2019t shouted at him at all.\u201cBravo!\u201d a loud female voice sounded. \u201cThose shameless people build their happiness on others\u2019 suffering, and they\u2019re even proud of that.\u201dThe girl was in a school uniform with long straight hair. She had very beautiful features with big round eyes, thick lips, and looked cute.But her behavior was so different from her appearance. She swaggered over in abrasive manners.It was 10 minutes away from the first class. There were many students walking inside. The girl\u2019s words attracted much attention.Qin Zheng was well-known in their high school for his good looks, excellent performance and rich family.But, all those were in others\u2019 eyes. Only his closest friends knew what he was really liked.If he was a real good boy, he wouldn\u2019t have chased Gu Xiaoxiao on a condition of hurting another innocent girl.However, the onlookers all stood on Qin Zheng\u2019s side. They didn\u2019t believe that what had happened between Qin Zheng and Gu Ning was immoral. They thought it was interesting instead.Only Mu Ke had warned Gu Ning.And no one else, except them, knew the truth about what had happened. Qin Zheng hadn\u2019t allowed Gu Ning to tell others, because it had been a game from the beginning to the end.If anyone else knew Qin Zheng had a girlfriend like Gu Ning, who was poor, self-abased and bad at studying, he would be humiliated.\u201cChu Peihan, you\u2026\u201dQin Zheng was annoyed while the crowd was confused.He wanted to argue back, but had no idea how to.He knew in his heart that he had done something bad.On the other side, Gu Ning frowned a little when she heard the name \u201cChu Peihan\u201d. She knew the girl was famous in school.But the girl wasn\u2019t famous for anything good. She was always late for classes, involved in fights and so forth. She had received countless warnings.Normally, she would have been expelled, but she was so good at studying and always be the top 40.Moreover, she was from a powerful family, so she wasn\u2019t afraid of being expelled at all.\u201cGee, don\u2019t be mad so easily. I didn\u2019t call your name after all.\u201d Chu Peihan laughed at Qin Zheng.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Chu Peihan\u2019s arrogant attitude made Qin Zheng be in a rage. He was speechless though, because Chu Peihan indeed hadn\u2019t called his name.Qin Zheng knew it wasn\u2019t a wise decision to stay here longer.He snorted, glared at Chu Peihan, and gave Gu Ning a complicated glance, then was gone.\u201cHa, I thought he was brave. He\u2019s merely a boring coward.\u201d Chu Peihan felt bored when Qin Zheng left.Qin Zheng hadn\u2019t gone far actually. He heard every word Chu Peihan had just said.He was irritated, but tried his best to curb his anger.Though Chu Peihan wasn\u2019t famous for anything good, Gu Ning liked her. She thought she was a good and funny girl.At least, Chu Peihan was being real.\u201cHey, is this the boy who you have loved? What a choice!\u201d Chu Peihan raised her eyebrow with disdain.The reason why Chu Peihan knew everything is because she had happened to see the scene when Qin Zheng had broken up with Gu Ning.Though she strongly disagreed what Qin Zheng had done, she wasn\u2019t interested in getting involved.She stood up for Gu Ning today only because she agreed with every word Gu Ning had just said to Qin Zheng.\u201cWell, I guess every girl will meet a bad boy when she\u2019s young and dumb,\u201d Gu Ning joked.\u201cYeah, sure,\u201d Chu Peihan laughed.\u201cOh, it\u2019s almost the time. Let\u2019s go to the classroom.\u201d Gu Ning ignored Chu Peihan, running away.Chu Peihan followed up immediately, \u201cI like what you\u2019ve said, and I\u2019ll use it in the future.\u201dGu Ning didn\u2019t know what to say. Was she really enjoying swearing?\u201cBe my guest,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cWhat else do you have?\u201d Chu Peihan asked sincerely.Gu Ning was speechless.\u201cNothing,\u201d Gu Ning answered casually. She didn\u2019t want to be bothered any longer.Chu Peihan pursed her lips, and closed her mouth.Chu Peihan studied at the second classroom, while Gu Ning at the fourth classroom. Their classrooms were on the same floor.After a while, both of them went up to the third floor.Chu Peihan entered her classroom first, and said good-bye to Gu Ning.In the fourth classroom of grade nine.The minute Gu Ning walked in, she felt unfriendly sights right away.She looked over. Shao Feifei was staring at her in an evil way. There were several other girls around her who glared at Gu Ning in the same way.Yang Yulu shared a table with Shao Feifei, and the girl sat before them called Wu Qingya. Those three girls were always together. Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya were Shao Feifei\u2019s acolytes in fact, because they followed Shao Feifei\u2019s orders.If Shao Feifei hated Gu Ning, they would do the same thing.Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya was willing to be Shao Feifei\u2019s acolytes for a reason.Shao Feifei was from a rich family, while Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya were from a normal family. They could have a relatively luxurious lifestyle as long as they followed Shao Feifei.Moreover, if any rich boy picked them, they could change their life.Shao Feifei\u2019s family only had millions of wealth, and wasn\u2019t the super rich family.The super rich families would own hundreds of millions wealth.If a family didn\u2019t have that much assets, they wouldn\u2019t be called the super rich.But in normal people\u2019s eyes, Shao Feifei\u2019s family was rich enough.The No. 3 High School was a common high school without many real rich young generation, so people like Shao Feifei was able to show off.Seeing Gu Ning coming, Shao Feifei\u2019s sight turned eviler.Shao Feifei was still angry about what had happened yesterday. Though she knew Gu Ning was different now, she wasn\u2019t scared of her.In her eyes, Gu Ning was still the poor pathetic girl.As for Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya, they were simply doing whatever Shao Feifei did.Gu Ning ignored them instead. She couldn\u2019t care less about those ridiculous people.She found her seat. It was at the back row.\u201cGu Ning, so nice to meet you again. You didn\u2019t come to class yesterday. I\u2019m worried.\u201d After Gu Ning had sat down, the girl beside her talked to her immediately.Gu Ning barely had friends in her school, except this girl, Yu Mixi, who shared a desk with her.Yu Mixi was also from a poor family. Her mother had been lying sick on the bed for many years. Her father ran a breakfast shop to support the whole family.Yu Mixi\u2019s family was living on a tight budget as well, because of her mother\u2019s illness and her tuition fee.Additionally, Yu Mixi\u2019s relatives disliked her family either. Those two poor girls ended up being good friends.Facing Yu Mixi\u2019s kindness, Gu Ning was moved. She explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel comfortable yesterday, so I didn\u2019t come.\u201d\u201cOh, are you alright now?\u201d Yu Mixi asked.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cGood to hear that,\u201d Yu Mixi was relieved.Gu Ning noticed her desk was clean today. She understood immediately that Yu Mixi had helped her. She felt grateful again.It was 6:50, the first class began. The students were supposed to read out loud, which helped them to remember the content. Gu Ning was reading the book quietly.Before long, the head teacher came.The head teacher\u2019s name was Zhang Qiuhua. She was around 40 years old, and was a strict teacher. Most importantly, she treated every student equally, no matter if the student was from a poor or a rich family.Gu Ning liked this teacher.Zhang Qiuhua stood in the front of the classroom.When her sight fell on Gu Ning, she was surprised, \u201cGu Ning, come out with me.\u201dThen, Zhang Qiuhua stepped out of the classroom first.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Seeing Gu Ning asked out by Zhang Qiuhua, everyone was looking at her. Some were puzzled, and some gloated, especially Shao Feifei and her friends. Shao Feifei believed the head teacher was going to blame Gu Ning for her yesterday\u2019s absence.Only Gu Ning stayed calm, and she knew the real intention of her head teacher.\u201cGu Ning\u2026\u201dYu Mixi called her with worry.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Gu Ning gave her a glance to comfort her.\u201cProfessor Zhang, nice to see you again,\u201d Gu Ning greeted Zhang Qiuhua politely.\u201cGu Ning, your mother told me that you were in a car accident, and needed a surgery. How could you be alright all of a sudden?\u201d Zhang Qiuhua asked with doubt.The day before yesterday, Gu Man had just called Zhang Qiuhua and told her Gu Ning had been caught by a car accident, but Gu Ning showed up as usual in school today, everyone would ask what had actually happened.Gu Ning understood that, so she explained, \u201cI did have a car accident. My brain has been damaged and I fell into unconsciousness. The doctor said there was blood congestion in my brain and must be cleaned out by surgery. However, I woke up the next day, and the blood congestion was gone. So I\u2019m fine now.\u201dZhang Qiuhua thought it was so unbelievable, but she didn\u2019t ask further. Miracles could happen.\u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re fine, but you need to take care of yourself. If you feel uncomfortable, just let me know. Now, you can go back.\u201d Zhang Qiuhua said. She cared about her student, especially she just had recovered from a car accident.\u201cThank you so much,\u201d Gu Ning thanked her teacher, then went back to classroom.The minute Gu Ning was back, everyone\u2019s sight fell on her again. They all wanted to know whether Zhang Qiuhua had criticized her.However, Gu Ning looked the same as usual. Nothing was different.Shao Feifei and her friends felt upset. Hadn\u2019t Zhang Qiuhua criticized Gu Ning?Or, Gu Ning was merely pretending that everything was fine.Exactly, she must be pretending. Zhang Qiuhua must had strongly criticized her!But Shao Feifei still felt uncomfortable to see that Gu Ning didn\u2019t wear a sad face.\u201cGu Ning, are you alright?\u201d Yu Mixi asked immediately when Gu Ning sat down.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Gu Ning smiled.Yu Mixi was relieved seeing Gu Ning was really fine. She continued to read when Zhang Qiuhua walked in.After a while, Yu Mixi finally realized that Gu Ning was different, but she didn\u2019t know where and why.Gu Ning, on the other side, focused on her books. She read and flipped fast, bearing the context in her mind.Shao Feifei paid her attention to Gu Ning once in a while. She saw how fast Gu Ning read a book. \u201cLook at Gu Ning, she\u2019s so good in pretending. How could she read a word by flipping so fast! And she even pretends to be a good student.\u201d Shao Feifei said to Yang Yulu.\u201cExactly, she\u2019s pretending to be a good student.\u201d Yang Yulu agreed.Shao Feifei intended to cause trouble when the class was over.\u201cYulu, Qingya, let me tell you something.\u201d Shao Feifei called Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya, but her voice was loud enough to let everyone in the classroom hear it clearly.Everyone instantly knew what was going to happen next, and they have all their ears on them.\u201cPlease tell us!\u201d Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya cooperated actively.\u201cI met somebody, who\u2019s too poor to afford a meal in a jewelry store yesterday. She was disliked because she didn\u2019t have much money. And she even said the jewelry of another person were fake. Wasn\u2019t she being so jealous of the rich?\u201d Shao Feifei talked to Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya, while watching at Gu Ning all the time. It was apparent that the \u201csomebody\u201d in her story was precisely Gu Ning.No one doubted Shao Feifei, but looked over at Gu Ning with disdain.Though many of them weren\u2019t from a rich family, they lived a much better life than Gu Ning. Moreover, none of them dared to walk in a jewelry store, which was the rich people\u2019s place.\u201cOf course she was jealous of the rich.\u201d Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya responded in a perfect accord.Yu Mixi glanced at Gu Ning with worry. She knew Gu Ning was not like that, and was mad at the other\u2019s behavior.Especially Shao Feifei and her friends, they were all bullies.Wasn\u2019t a jewelry store open to anyone? Who said the poor couldn\u2019t walk in a jewelry store? And why did someone has to buy something once he or she walked in a jewelry store?But Yu Mixi was too weak to argue back. She only kept the anger to herself.\u201cWell, I think somebody does have a good appearance. If she can\u2019t buy it on her own, she can find herself a sugar daddy. As long as her sugar daddy is pleased, she\u2019s able to buy one then.\u201d Shao Feifei added.Hearing this, everyone stared at Gu Ning in a strange way, like she had already found herself a sugar daddy.Even Gu Ning herself was displeased now. She threw a cold look at Shao Feifei. The latter felt threatened at once.But a few seconds later, Shao Feifei felt she had been humiliated, and was annoyed. She yelled at Gu Ning, \u201cWhat do you think you are? I\u2019m not talking about you. If you\u2019re willing to admit, be my guest!\u201d\u201cOh, have I admitted that you\u2019re talking about me? I\u2019m just curious why do you keep looking at me while you\u2019re telling the story? Do you have a crush on me? Sorry to tell you, I only like boys.\u201d Gu Ning wore a serious face while she was joking.\u201cHa-ha.\u201d\u201cHa-ha, Ha-ha.\u201dEveryone laughed out loud, which made Shao Feifei feel embarrassed. She hit the desk with a snap sound, shouting at Gu Ning, \u201cGu Ning, shut your mouth! You\u2019re literally shameless! I don\u2019t like you. If you dare to say it again, I\u2019ll tear you mouth apart!\u201dWhile saying this, Shao Feifei seemed she was ready to fight.\u201cGu Ning, you\u2019re a shameless girl, and stay away from Feifei!\u201d Yang Yulu helped Shao Feifei, and glared at Gu Ning.\u201cExactly, Gu Ning, how could you be so shameless!\u201d Wu Qingya followed up with an evil face.\u201cGu Ning\u2026\u201d Yu Mixi called her with concern, trying to stop her from standing up against Shao Feifei.But before she could say it, Gu Ning stopped her by a glance.Gu Ning knew Yu Mixi was worried about her, but she was different now. She wasn\u2019t scared of Shao Feifei any longer.And she wanted to deal with her issues by herself.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16She hoped her real friends would understand her instead of questioning her decisions.Gu Ning decided to talk to Yu Mixi later about that.It was the first time that Yu Mixi had seen Gu Ning being so aggressive and brave. She closed her mouth and stayed quiet.Facing Shao Feifei and her two helpers, Gu Ning stayed calm, \u201cThen you tell me why did you look at me all the time while you were telling the story?\u201dGu Ning did it on purpose to irritate Shao Feifei. Shao Feifei immediately argued back with intense dislike, \u201cBecause the somebody was you! Do you want to deny it? You\u2019re poor and you dare to walk in a jewelry store. You couldn\u2019t afford anything in there, and you were jealous of those who could. If you want a piece of jewelry, take my advice and find yourself a sugar daddy, probably your sugar daddy\u2026\u201dShao Feifei stopped all of a sudden, because her mouth was stuck by a ball of paper. The paper ball was exactly thrown by Gu Ning in a quick, violent and accurate way.Everyone was struck dumb with amazement.\u201cWhat? What has happened? Did Gu Ning just throw a paper ball into Shao Feifei\u2019s mouth from three meters away?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cReally? It couldn\u2019t be true! It must be a coincidence.\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201dThe rest remained speechless..Everyone was shocked, but believed it was merely a coincidence.Shao Feifei almost swallowed the paper ball down, and felt disgusted. She spat the ball out at once, roaring in anger to Gu Ning, \u201cYou bitch! How dare you!\u201dGu Ning didn\u2019t say a word, but approached Shao Feifei step by step. She stared straight at Shao Feifei, which frightened Shao Feifei.Gu Ning walked to Shao Feifei and soon she\u2019s in front of her. Before Shao Feifei was able to react, she raised her hand and slapped Shao Feifei across the face.\u201cBam.\u201d A loud snap sound. Everyone was more than shocked now.Gu Ning beat Shao Feifei?Not only had Gu Ning hit Shao Feifei, she also had hit her with great force. Shao Feifei was slapped dumb with a mark of palm on her face.\u201cGu Ning, you\u2019re so rude and unkind. How could you hit Shao Feifei!\u201d At that moment, Yang Chengjun argued, like it was all Gu Ning\u2019s fault.Everybody knew Yang Chengjun liked Shao Feifei, and he would stand up for her no matter what she had done.Unfortunately, Shao Feifei didn\u2019t like him.Though Yang Chengjun was tall and handsome, he was from an ordinary family. Shao Feifei wouldn\u2019t like a boy from a much poorer family than hers.But Shao Feifei enjoyed the feeling that she was protected by somebody, which showed she was charismatic. Shao Feifei would not reject Yang Chengjun neither.Probably Yang Chengjun still believed he had a chance, or he was merely enjoying chasing. He never gave up on Shao Feifei.\u201cWasn\u2019t she being so rude to humiliate me?\u201d Gu Ning asked back.\u201cBut she didn\u2019t hit you,\u201d Yang Chengjun argued.\u201cThen I can humiliate her as well?\u201d Gu Ning sneered.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dSuddenly, Shao Feifei shouted out, \u201cGu Ning, how dare you beat me! You\u2019re a bitch!\u201dShao Feifei swore at Gu Ning and raised her hand. Before her hand fell down, Gu Ning caught it in the air.Everyone was astonished by Gu Ning\u2019s speed. She was able to catch Shao Feifei\u2019s hand so quickly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you dare to call me bitch any more, I\u2019ll let you suffer more than a slap.\u201d Gu Ning warned coldly. Shao Feifei felt the pressure immediately. She looked at Gu Ning with her mouth shut.The rest of the students in the classroom all remained silent. Nobody dared to utter a word.Gu Ning loosened Shao Feifei\u2019s hand, returning back to her seat.After a few seconds, Shao Feifei realized she had been hit and humiliated by Gu Ning. She tried to win back.\u201cGu Ning, do you want to get away with it like that?\u201d Shao Feifei shouted again. She threw a bottle of water on her desk to Gu Ning\u2019s head.Seeing this, almost everyone waited to witness another drama.Though they found Gu Ning was different and became brave as well as persuasive, they still had a very low opinion of her.In their eyes, no matter how Gu Ning had changed, she wasn\u2019t able to change the fact that she was from a poor family without any influence.As for Shao Feifei, she was born in a rich powerful family. Gu Ning was doomed to fail in the end.It was so easy for Shao Feifei\u2019s family to deal with such a little trouble like Gu Ning.So, what Gu Ning had done only raised dislike.Unexpectedly, Gu Ning turned around, hitting the bottle of water back at Shao Feifei. The bottle knocked straight on Shao Feifei\u2019s forehead. Her forehead was already starting to swell.Once again, everyone was amazed.If Gu Ning had done it by chance the last time, then she must has aimed at Shao Feifei this time.Now, everyone\u2019s opinion of Gu Ning began to change.At short notice, Shao Feifei cried out.\u201cFeifei\u2026\u201d Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya ran to check Shao Feifei\u2019s injury.\u201cGu Ning, you\u2026\u201d Yang Chengjun was annoyed. He clenched his fists, and was likely to fight with Gu Ning.Right at this moment, the head teacher came in.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d the head teacher asked seriously.Seeing the head teacher was here, Yang Chengjun immediately replied, \u201cIt\u2019s Gu Ning. She slapped and hit Shao Feifei!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Yang Chengjun wanted to have a preemptive strike on Gu Ning, but he forgot that the head teacher never jumped to conclusions without knowing all the facts.So, the head teacher turned to Gu Ning and inquired, \u201cGu Ning, can you explain all of that?\u201d\u201cYes, I admit that I\u2019ve hit Shao Feifei, only because she has insulted me first. I went to a jewelry store yesterday. I just wanted to take a look, but she humiliated me for being poor. And today, she laughed at me in front of everyone, saying I needed to find myself a sugar daddy. I simply used a ball of paper to shut her mouth, then she called me bitch. I was so irritated, and slapped her. She threw a bottle of water to me afterwards. I raised my hand to protect myself. Unexpectedly, the bottle of water flew right back at her, and hit her forehead. That\u2019s all.\u201d Gu Ning answered. She did tell the truth, but didn\u2019t say that she deliberately had aimed at Shao Feifei to hit her by the bottle of water.Gu Ning think there was no need to hide.The head teacher was more than disappointed now. She turned to Shao Feifei, \u201cIs it true?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Shao Feifei wanted to argue, but she was afraid of the head teacher. She didn\u2019t say anything at the end, but lowered her head.Yang Chengjun, Wu Qingya and Yang Yulu remained quiet as well. They all didn\u2019t want to get into trouble.Now, the head teacher knew what really had happened.\u201cIt was Shao Feifei\u2019s fault to insult Gu Ning at first, then it was Gu Ning\u2019s fault to hit Shao Feifei back. Since you both have made mistakes, you either both receive a punishment or forgive each other. You can choose.\u201d The head teacher decided to let them make the choice themselves.Punishment couldn\u2019t solve every problem. Their attitude mattered most.The head teacher didn\u2019t care whether they would fight again, as long as they didn\u2019t fight in the school.Gu Ning agreed. That was exactly what she wanted.So she said to Shao Feifei casually, \u201cShao Feifei, you can choose. Whatever you want. I don\u2019t mind.\u201dShao Feifei thought it was a challenge though. She was angry, and glared at Gu Ning.Shao Feifei absolutely would not forgive Gu Ning. She was the one who had been injured after all. However, she didn\u2019t want to be punished neither.Thus, even though Shao Feifei was annoyed, she had to call it an end.But she promised to herself that she would beat Gu Ning one day in the future.\u201cAlright, Shao Feifei was hurt, and must go to the infirmary now,\u201d the head teacher said.Then, accompanied by Yang Yulu, Shao Feifei went to the infirmary. Yang Chengjun glared at Gu Ning before he went back to his seat. The second class began.There were few people outside. Shao Feifei said with anger, \u201cGu Ning, let\u2019s go and see! I\u2019ll definitely pay you back!\u201d\u201cSure! We must teach Gu Ning a lesson,\u201d Yang Yulu agreed immediately.The head teacher taught math. She was a strict teacher, and no one dared to zone out.Gu Ning focused on the class as well. Though she owned the Jade Eyes, she needed to learn.Luckily, she was a good student in her last incarnation. It wasn\u2019t difficult for her to learn.As for Yu Mixi, she was still worried during the whole class. She felt slightly uncomfortable about Gu Ning\u2019s change, but she was more concerned that Shao Feifei would revenge on Gu Ning.At last, the class was over. Yu Mixi asked Gu Ning at once, \u201cGu Ning, you\u2019ve had bad blood with Shao Feifei. Aren\u2019t you afraid\u2026\u201dBefore Yu Mixi could finish, Gu Ning interrupted her.Gu Ning wore a serious face. She said in a low voice, \u201cMixi, I know you care about me, but I just want to let you know staying quiet and weak won\u2019t help you with anything. I\u2019ve had enough, and I don\u2019t think Shao Feifei is able to hurt me.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re scared of her, you can stay away from me. I won\u2019t blame you. If you\u2019re still willing to be my friend, then get used to my changes. And I do hope you can change as well. You need to say no to whatever you dislike. You need to fight back against unfairness. Most importantly, you need to fight for what you want. I\u2019m not going to force you to. It\u2019s all up to you.\u201dGu Ning would not force Yu Mixi to change. She just wanted to help.What Gu Ning had said literally shocked Yu Mixi.She thought Gu Ning was right. If you were always weak and quiet, nobody would care about your real feelings.Seeing Gu Ning being so outgoing and confident, Yu Mixi was encouraged. She wanted to change too.Though she was still afraid of Shao Feifei, she wasn\u2019t willing to stay quiet and weak any longer. She wanted to live for herself. She would say no to her dislikes, fight against the unfairness, and fight for what she loved.Yu Mixi had the answer in her heart, but she couldn\u2019t help doubting herself, \u201cGu Ning, you\u2019re right. Being weak and quiet won\u2019t help us with anything. I hate to be humiliated any more. I want to change, but can I?\u201d\u201cAs long as you want to, then you absolutely can,\u201d Gu Ning said.Yu Mixi was determined now, \u201cI will.\u201d\u201cMixi, since you\u2019re my friend, I promise if you need me, I\u2019ll spare no effort to help you. And I hate betrayal. Please tell me directly if you don\u2019t want to be my friend, instead of hurting me for benefits.\u201d Gu Ning said, warned and promised at the same time.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Facing Gu Ning\u2019s warning and promise, Yu Mixi replied with honesty, \u201cGu Ning, I cherish our friendship.\u201dYes, though Yu Mixi was self-abased, she knew what was loyalty. Once she had taken somebody as her friend, she wouldn\u2019t betray.\u201cGreat, I believe you,\u201d Gu Ning smiled lightly. For this time, Gu Ning sincerely took Yu Mixi as her friend.It wasn\u2019t easy for Gu Ning to trust someone, but as long as she decided to, she would take it seriously.Gu Ning of course wouldn\u2019t tell her friend everything, but she wouldn\u2019t hurt her friend either. She was always willing to help her friend.During this morning, Shao Feifei, Yang Yulu, Wu Qingya and Yang Chengjun all glared at Gu Ning with hatred.Gu Ning knew Shao Feifei wouldn\u2019t give up, but she wasn\u2019t afraid at all. She was different now.When they had finished morning classes, Gu Ning and Yu Mixi left the classroom. They went straight to the canteen. Fortunately, Shao Feifei didn\u2019t find them any trouble.But the minute Gu Ning walked out of the teaching building, she was stopped by a girl.The girl was Gu Xiaoxiao, Gu Ning\u2019s cousin, who was one of the causes of Gu Ning\u2019s \u201cdeath\u201d.Though Gu Xiaoxiao wasn\u2019t as pretty as Gu Ning, she had good features, otherwise Qin Zheng wouldn\u2019t have fallen in love with her.Moreover, Gu Xiaoxiao was from a rich family.Although the Qin Family has the power and some money, it wasn\u2019t enough.They needed more money to achieve their goals.\u201cGu Ning, I didn\u2019t expect you could survive.\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes were full of hatred and unkindness. She had had nightmares for two days after she had witnessed the car accident.But when she heard the news from Qin Zheng this morning that Gu Ning had survived, her hatred grew deeper.She had suffered from nightmares for two days, while Gu Ning was fine and healthy. Gu Xiaoxiao couldn\u2019t stand the truth.Gu Xiaoxiao was a selfish girl who only cared about herself. In her eyes, it was all Gu Ning\u2019s fault.\u201cIf I really died because of that car accident, aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019m going to find you as a ghost?\u201d Gu Ning stared at Gu Xiaoxiao with a fake smile on her face.Gu Ning knew Gu Xiaoxiao must be terrified, and had two terrible days because of the car accident.Of course, Gu Xiaoxiao didn\u2019t feel guilty at all. She was merely scared.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s face changed. Gu Ning had hit the point apparently.Though Gu Xiaoxiao was annoyed, she didn\u2019t want to mention the car accident any more. \u201cGu Ning, Qin Zheng never liked you anyway. You\u2019re no longer his girlfriend. So please stay away from him, and don\u2019t embarrass yourself.\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said to Gu Ning.Gu Xiaoxiao was being proud like she was the winner. She just wanted to hurt Gu Ning. She wanted to see Gu Ning being sad and miserable.Unfortunately, Gu Ning had already changed. She would not be hurt, but instead felt disgusted.And in Gu Ning\u2019s eyes, Gu Xiaoxiao was merely a joke.\u201cI don\u2019t want such a terrible boy like him at all. Only girls like you will find him attractive. Disgusting!\u201d Gu Ning argued.\u201cWhat?\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was surprised. She couldn\u2019t believe what she had just heard from Gu Ning.She said she disliked Qin Zheng, and even thought he was terrible?Gu Xiaoxiao wouldn\u2019t believe it.Gu Ning must be pretending that she didn\u2019t care.Gu Xiaoxiao responded afterwards, \u201cGu Ning, keep lying to yourself. Do you really think I\u2019ll believe you?\u201d\u201cBelieve it or not, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Gu Ning couldn\u2019t care less about Gu Xiaoxiao.Then, she walked away directly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dGu Xiaoxiao was irritated. She wanted to catch Gu Ning and argued back, but had to give up because she was waiting for Qin Zheng.After a while, Gu Xiaoxiao suddenly realized Gu Ning was a little different now.In the past, Gu Ning would never argue back. However, she was so aggressive now.Had her personality changed after the car accident?When they had walked away, Yu Mixi looked at Gu Ning once in a while. She seemed she had something to say.\u201cJust tell me what do you want to say,\u201d Gu Ning asked first.Though Gu Ning actually knew what Yu Mixi wanted to know, she still intended to let Yu Mixi ask out herself.After a few seconds, Yu Mixi couldn\u2019t help but inquire, \u201cGu Ning, have you really been with Qin Zheng?\u201dIt was beyond Yu Mixi\u2019s imagination that Qin Zheng would be with Gu Ning. The two were from hugely different backgrounds.Yu Mixi was curious.\u201cKind of. Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to humiliate me, so she let Qin Zheng chase me, then dumped me after two months. She merely wanted to see me being a joke. So I don\u2019t think I really have been with him.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t hide. She told the truth.\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu Mixi was shocked. Then she felt aggrieved for Gu Ning, \u201cThey\u2019re just a bunch of bullies. How could they do that to you!\u201dYu Mixi felt sorry for Gu Ning, and also felt guilty for she couldn\u2019t do anything for her friend.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s an old story. I\u2019m good now,\u201d Gu Ning comforted Yu Mixi.Yu Mixi took a look at Gu Ning, making sure she was actually good. Then Yu Mixi felt better. \u201cDid, did he take advantage of you?\u201d Yu Mixi asked later.\u201cNo, we even didn\u2019t walk hand in hand,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Yes, they even hadn\u2019t walked hand in hand, let alone other intimate behaviors.Qin Zheng never liked Gu Ning. Their relationship was merely a game. Qin Zheng would never touch Gu Ning.\u201cGreat,\u201d Yu Mixi was relieved.Gu Ning smiled, but didn\u2019t explain further. She thought Yu Mixi was a lovely friend.When they finally arrived at the canteen, Yu Mixi went to take food, but asked Gu Ning to stay on her seat.Gu Ning knew Yu Mixi wanted to buy her lunch in case she would eat a beamed bun as usual.But Gu Ning rejected.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19\u201cThis meal is on me. Let me tell you a secret. I\u2019ve picked up some money on a road. It was said that you must share the money that you accidentally picked up with someone else, or you\u2019ll have bad luck.\u201d Gu Ning lied to Yu Mixi with the same old excuse.\u201cReally? That\u2019s great. Then this time is on you. I\u2019ll buy you a meal this afternoon.\u201d Yu Mixi didn\u2019t reject this time. She also had heard the old saying.The canteen had two floors. The first floor was for the public, providing cheap and not delicious food. The food was made in a large amount every time. Taste wasn\u2019t the first priority, as long as the food was cooked.The second floor was a private dining place. You could order whatever you wanted first, then the cook would cook for you one by one. Accordingly, the price was much higher.If you dined in the public cafeteria, 10 yuan would be enough. However, if you dined in the private cafeteria, a hundred yuan were barely enough.So when Gu Ning proposed to have their meal on the second floor, Yu Mixi immediately refused.Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t listen to her, and walked to the second floor directly. Yu Mixi then had to follow up.Though the students in the private cafeteria weren\u2019t as many as the students in the public cafeteria, the second floor was mostly occupied, because there were lots of rich kids.The second Gu Ning and her friend went upstairs, an unkind female voice sounded, \u201cGee, isn\u2019t this Gu Ning from the fourth classroom? Isn\u2019t she the well-known poor student? Why is she here?\u201dGu Ning actually wasn\u2019t famous at all. Only her classmates or Gu Xiaoxiao and Qin Zheng\u2019s friends knew her.The girl had already mentioned Gu Ning was from the fourth classroom, which meant she wasn\u2019t Gu Ning\u2019s classmate. The girl also couldn\u2019t be Qin Zheng\u2019s acquaintance.Gu Ning was sure that she must be a friend of Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s.Gu Ning had no intention to argue back. She looked over at the girl. The girl was exactly Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s good friend. Her name was Chen Ziyao. She was a senior from the second classroom.Chen Ziyao was born in a rich family as well. Her father, who had dozens of millions of assets, was a director of a famous real estate corporation.The corporation Chen Ziyao\u2019s father worked for was in close cooperation with the company Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s father worked for. They gathered together often. Chen Ziyao and Gu Xiaoxiao became good friends naturally.Chen Ziyao also knew what had happened between Gu Ning and Qin Zheng. However, Gu Xiaoxiao and Qin Zheng had asked her to keep the truth to herself, so she never told anyone.Gu Ning just gave her a glance, then ignored her. She went to an empty table with Yu Mixi, starting to order.Gu Ning ignored Chen Ziyao, but in Chen Ziyao\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning was a coward. She was used to laughing at Gu Ning all the time, and Gu Ning never had argued back.\u201cI think she probably has picked up money on a road,\u201d a girl who sat beside Chen Ziyao added. They never miss any chance to make fun of Gu Ning.Yu Mixi, on the other side, was surprised that the girl knew the fact.Seeing Yu Mixi\u2019s face, Gu Ning didn\u2019t know how to explain.Before long, Gu Ning had finished their order.It was the best meal they ever had in school for all those years.\u201cGu Ning, isn\u2019t this too much?\u201d Yu Mixi asked. They had spent almost two hundred yuan. If they ate in the public cafeteria, two hundred yuan were totally enough for a week.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Gu Ning replied.Yu Mixi then closed her mouth.\u201cOh, let me see what do you two poor little girl have today.\u201d Chen Ziyao stood up, walking towards Gu Ning. She assumed Gu Ning and Yu Mixi must be too poor to have something really good.Only those rich girls who were bored would enjoy making fun of others.The minute Chen Ziyao came over, Gu Ning put away the bill. She stood up and went to the cook. Gu Ning directly ignored Chen Ziyao again.Chen Ziyao was displeased. She reached out to grab the bill.However, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t allow her to do that.Gu Ning moved slightly away. Chen Ziyao grabbed nothing but air. She felt embarrassed, shouting at Gu Ning afterwards, \u201cGu Ning, how dare you to escape!\u201dChen Ziyao\u2019s angry voice raised attention from many students.Gu Ning ignored Chen Ziyao earlier because she didn\u2019t want to get into trouble, but now the trouble found her, Gu Ning decided to face it.She stopped, looking straight at Chen Ziyao, \u201cWhy not?\u201dChen Ziyao was struck dumb suddenly. She didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning would argue back.In Chen Ziyao\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning was merely a poor weak miserable girl. She could bully Gu Ning whenever and wherever she wanted.But now everything was different. Gu Ning even argued her back in front of everyone. Chen Ziyao felt shamed, \u201cGu Ning, you know you\u2019re a poor girl and have no right to fight against me!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me being a poor girl? It\u2019s none of your business. You have no right to stand in my way!\u201d Gu Ning argued again. She never liked Chen Ziyao.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chen Ziyao was annoyed.Actually Chen Ziyao did have no right to stand in others\u2019 way. Now, the onlookers all believed Chen Ziyao had shamed herself.Amid everyone\u2019s dislike, Chen Ziyao was more than irritated.She knew she had no right to stand in Gu Ning\u2019s way, but she was so used to making fun of Gu Ning. Chen Ziyao couldn\u2019t accept the fact that Gu Ning had stood up against her.Therefore, Chen Ziyao didn\u2019t give up, \u201cGu Ning, do you know your mother was pregnant before getting married? You\u2019re merely a bastard without a father\u2026\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20\u201cBam.\u201dBefore Chen Ziyao was able to finish, she was slapped heavily on the face. This time was much heavier than last time on Shao Feifei\u2019s face.What Chen Ziyao had said completely irritated Gu Ning.Not only had Chen Ziyao humiliated Gu Ning, but also had humiliated her mother, which was absolutely unbearable.Chen Ziyao was hit dumb, and didn\u2019t know what to do next all of a sudden.It was beyond her imagination that Gu Ning had the nerve to hit her.Everyone was also shocked by what had happened, but no one disagreed.Though some of them disliked Gu Ning when they found out her background, they all believed it was rude to humiliate Gu Ning in that way.Not everyone would make fun of other people\u2019s pain.\u201cGu Ning, how dare you hit me!\u201d Chen Ziyao finally realized what she had got. She raised her hand, trying to beat Gu Ning.However, the second she raised her hand, she was caught tightly by Gu Ning. Chen Ziyao was in pain immediately, but unable to run away.\u201cGu Ning, let me go!\u201d Chen Ziyao\u2019s face changed because of the pain.Gu Ning didn\u2019t let her go. She looked coldly at Chen Ziyao. Her sight was like an icy sword on Chen Ziyao\u2019s neck. Chen Ziyao felt threatened at once with horror on her face.Chen Ziyao was even trembling under the pressure of Gu Ning.Everyone was also astonished by Gu Ning\u2019s power. The private cafeteria was quiet like death all of a sudden.Gu Ning opened her mouth, \u201cChen Ziyao, I don\u2019t think I have ever hurt you. Why couldn\u2019t you stop doing this to me? Do you really think I\u2019ll let you get away with it when you\u2019ve humiliated my mother before my face?\u201dThen, Gu Ning threw Chen Ziyao away by her hand. Chen Ziyao stumbled, and almost fell.The girl, who was with Chen Ziyao, didn\u2019t dare to say a word.Chen Ziyao herself was still in a shock.At the same time, Gu Xiaoxiao and her friends had just showed up on the second floor. They saw there was a crowd nearby, and were curious.They walked near, then found out Gu Ning and Chen Ziyao were in the center of the crowd.Gu Xiaoxiao immediately shoved through to the center. There was a swollen red palm mark on Chen Ziyao\u2019s cheek. Gu Xiaoxiao was mad at once, \u201cZiyao, what has happened?\u201dChen Ziyao heard Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s voice, then got her mind back. Though she was scared of Gu Ning now, she was full of anger.But Chen Ziyao didn\u2019t know what to say now, she only glared at Gu Ning with anger, which was a response to Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s question.Now, Gu Xiaoxiao knew Gu Ning had hit Chen Ziyao. She found it hard to believe that Gu Ning had done that, but she shouted at Gu Ning at once, \u201cGu Ning, how dare you hit Ziyao? Are you insane?\u201d\u201cWhat? Gu Ning hit Chen Ziyao? That\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dA boy named Zhang Yiming, who was with Qin Zheng, suddenly said out loud. He couldn\u2019t believe it was the fact.Exactly, they all knew what kind of a girl Gu Ning was. Gu Ning was always weak, quiet, self-abased and never ever dared to argue with another person. It was impossible that Gu Ning had hit Chen Ziyao.\u201cIndeed, I don\u2019t believe it neither,\u201d another boy called Fu Mingliang agreed.While Qin Zheng believed it.\u201cYes, I did hit Chen Ziyao, so what?\u201d Gu Ning admitted in front of everyone, then she turned to Gu Xiaoxiao, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business.\u201dHearing this, Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang were both astonished.What? She really hit Chen Ziyao? How was it possible?\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was annoyed. She was angry that Gu Ning dared to argue with her in public, \u201cZiyao is my friend, It is my business.\u201d\u201cWow!\u201d Gu Ning sneered, \u201cSo what are you gonna do?\u201d\u201cYou have to pay for what you\u2019ve done. You either knock your head on the ground for 10 times, or let Ziyao hit you back on the face for 10 times,\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said with pure unkindness.Everyone held their breath after that.10 times? Gu Xiaoxiao was so cold-blooded. It was Chen Ziyao who had humiliated Gu Ning first.Suddenly, everyone had a different opinion of Gu Xiaoxiao.Qin Zheng and his friends frowned with dissatisfaction too. They also thought it was too over. However, Qin Zheng still remembered what Gu Ning had done to him this morning, so he didn\u2019t stop Gu Xiaoxiao.As for Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang, both of them lacked of sympathy. They all came to have fun.Moreover, they were also curious about what Gu Ning would do next after she had hit Chen Ziyao.\u201cOh, Gu Ning, it\u2019s you again. How come everyone wants to cause you trouble? You\u2019re pathetic.\u201dBefore Gu Ning could say a word, a female voice sounded first in an ironic way, but without any unkindness.Gu Ning knew who this girl was when she heard her voice. It must be Chu Peihan!Indeed, it was Chu Peihan.Chu Peihan walked over with her hands in pockets, like a hoodlum.Everyone immediately stepped away and let her go through. They seemed scared of her.Chu Peihan was a widely-known bad girl in their school. She was skillful at fighting, so no one dared to annoy her.Even Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao were willing to stay away from Chu Peihan.Thus, when Chu Peihan showed up, Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao lowered their voices at once.Qin Zheng, Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang weren\u2019t afraid of Chu Peihan though, they knew Chu Peihan was from a powerful family, and wouldn\u2019t stand up against her normally.Though Qin Zheng had been humiliated by Chu Peihan this morning and hated her, he didn\u2019t want to fight with her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Qin Zheng was confused about the relationship between Chu Peihan and Gu Ning. They didn\u2019t seem like friends, because Chu Peihan always talked to Gu Ning in an unfriendly way.However, she stood up for Gu Ning.Qin Zheng wasn\u2019t sure whether Chu Peihan was helping Gu Ning, or merely hated him.If Chu Peihan hated him, he honestly had no idea why she would do that.On the other side, Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao didn\u2019t know what had happened this morning. They believed Chu Peihan was here to laugh at Gu Ning too.In Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s and Chen Ziyao\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning was a joke herself who was meant to be bullied.They never thought about the possibility that Chu Peihan and Gu Ning were friends. It was impossible from their perspectives.Why?They didn\u2019t believe Chu Peihan, a girl from a powerful family, would make a friend with Gu Ning, who was from a poor family.Actually, they weren\u2019t clear about Chu Peihan\u2019s background. They only knew she had support from the principal.Everyone, Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao included, believed Chu Peihan was here to make fun of Gu Ning, except Qin Zheng who looked doubtful.Yu Mixi was nervous now, but didn\u2019t dare to say anything.\u201cI know. They\u2019re all jealous of my beauty,\u201d Gu Ning joked, like her beauty was really a burden to her.Zhang Yiming immediately laughed out loud.He looked at Gu Ning with disdain, \u201cGu Ning, how dare you to say that? I don\u2019t see your beauty at all, but your poverty is quite obvious.\u201d\u201cExactly, nobody will be jealous of you! You poor girl!\u201dGu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao agreed at once. Though they did bully Gu Ning because she was prettier than them, they would never admit it.No one knew the real reason why Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao enjoyed bullying Gu Ning, but it was a common acknowledgment that Gu Ning was more beautiful than Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao.Thus, Gu Ning\u2019s reply didn\u2019t raise much dislike.Gu Ning wasn\u2019t mad at all, \u201cThen why won\u2019t you leave me alone? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever hurt them. If they\u2019re not being jealous of my beauty, then what?\u201dWhile Gu Ning was saying, she unconsciously wear a cute face. Everyone, Qin Zheng included, was attracted by her at once.Gu Ning was a beauty indeed. Before Tang Aining was reborn to her body , she had always been quiet, self-abased. Even though she was beautiful, nobody appreciated her beauty.But now, Gu Ning was full of confidence and power. It was hard to ignore her.Now, more and more students around them believed Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao bullied Gu Ning only because Gu Ning was prettier than them.After a while, Gu Ning added. \u201cAnd, Chen Ziyao just said I\u2019m bullied because of my poverty. Actually, I don\u2019t understand why my poverty somehow becomes the reason that she should bully me.\u201dGu Ning said in a calm and slow way, without anger or hatred, like she wasn\u2019t the one who had been bullied.Hearing this, everyone\u2019s opinion of Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao became very low. Some even felt anger and unfairness for Gu Ning.What Gu Ning had said was the plain truth, which everyone had seen and heard.At short notice, Gu Ning won most students\u2019 support.\u201cExactly, what\u2019s wrong with being poor? They\u2019re bullies!\u201d\u201cNo one would stand still and wait to be hit. Idiot!\u201d\u201cShe has even humiliated the girl\u2019s family. She\u2019s such a bad person!\u201dThe crowd of onlookers started to blame Chen Ziyao.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Chen Ziyao was so irritated that she didn\u2019t know how to argue back.Gu Xiaoxiao was speechless too.While Qin Zheng, Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang stayed away from the drama.They noticed Chen Ziyao lost everyone\u2019s support, and wasn\u2019t willing to be involved.The boys didn\u2019t want to ruin their fame as well.\u201cGu Ning, what have you done the last lifetime? Your poverty now becomes a problem in others\u2019 eyes.\u201d Chu Peihan rolled her eyes at Gu Ning with dislike.\u201cWell, in that case, I must be super rich one day.\u201d Gu Ning responded.She would sooner or later.Gu Xiaoxiao immediately mocked, \u201cGee! Live in your dream, Gu Ning.\u201dShe wouldn\u2019t believe Gu Ning could be rich throughout her life.\u201cI think it\u2019s possible,\u201d Chu Peihan suddenly said.Chu Peihan had the feeling that Gu Ning wasn\u2019t an ordinary girl.Gu Xiaoxiao was surprised that Chu Peihan helped Gu Ning. Wasn\u2019t she supposed to laugh at Gu Ning as well?\u201cGu Xiaoxiao, let\u2019s go and see! I\u2019m poor now but it doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019ll be poor forever!\u201d Gu Ning replied with determination and confidence.Before Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao could argue back, Gu Ning opened her mouth again.\u201cGu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao, I advise you both to stay away from me from now on, or you\u2019ll regret for sure.\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao warned them with a cold look.Gu Ning actually didn\u2019t care about whether Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao would listen to her. She had made her mind to stand up for herself against them.Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao were certainly displeased by Gu Ning\u2019s warning, \u201cGu Ning, what do you think you are? You\u2026\u201dRight at that moment, Qin Zheng interrupted, \u201cEnough!\u201dGu Xiaoxiao was his girlfriend, and he ought to protect her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Qin Zheng now understood Chu Peihan was here to help Gu Ning. If he didn\u2019t get involved, the drama wouldn\u2019t end.\u201cBut, Gu Ning hit Ziyao\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao wasn\u2019t willing to give up.Before Qin Zheng could reply, Gu Ning said first, \u201cShe deserves it. If she does it again in the future, a slap won\u2019t be enough.\u201dThen Gu Ning gave Chen Ziyao a cold look. The latter trembled out of fear. Now Chen Ziyao was really scared of Gu Ning.\u201cGu Ning, let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d Though Chen Ziyao felt frightened, she didn\u2019t want to escape like that. She pretended to be calm and left with Gu Xiaoxiao.Or, escaped away.Qin Zheng and his friends took a look at Gu Ning, then were gone too.They all thought to themselves that Gu Ning was literally different now.Seeing this, Gu Ning merely sneered, then walked back to her seat.The rest of the students dispersed afterwards.However, a girl had no intention to leave. She sat down right beside Gu Ning, \u201cI\u2019m starving now. Where the hell is my food!\u201dAn unkind voice as usual.Gu Ning didn\u2019t mind though.Yu Mixi felt nervous the minute Chu Peihan sat down.She was confused as well. Wasn\u2019t Chu Peihan attacking Gu Ning a moment ago? Why are they looked so close now?\u201cYou can\u2019t let them go like that. If I had been you, I would have beaten them all! You need to teach them a lesson first, then they will stay away.\u201d Chu Peihan complained. She disagreed with Gu Ning about what just had happened.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t help but pull her lips. Chu Peihan was really a bad girl who liked fighting so much.Though Gu Ning appreciated what Chu Peihan had said and done, she knew she wasn\u2019t a teenager girl any more. Her soul was a 25 years old mature woman.Gu Ning would not beat someone unless it was necessary.She wasn\u2019t a coward.\u201cIf I had beaten them, I must pay for their treatment as well. I don\u2019t want to do that,\u201d Gu Ning said.Um.Chu Peihan was struck dumb at first, then realized Gu Ning was from a poor family. She immediately felt embarrassed.But, Chu Peihan felt slightly uncomfortable. Was Gu Ning implying that she liked to pay for others\u2019 treatment? Chu Peihan did pay for others\u2019 treatment every time she had beaten someone.She had spent a lot on that indeed, but there was always someone that annoyed her.At this moment, the food was on the table. Chu Peihan dropped the topic at once and enjoyed her meal.The meal was enough for three of them.On the other side, Qin Zheng and his friends had to go to the infirmary due to Chen Ziyao\u2019s injury. They didn\u2019t have a chance to eat.After the meal, it was still too early for the afternoon classes.Most seniors went back to their classrooms because they were under great academic pressure.However, it wasn\u2019t necessary for Gu Ning to spend her leisure time on studying, so she had no plan to go back.\u201cDo you want to go back to the classroom reading, or hang out with me?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to study. I would rather fool around if I\u2019m free.\u201d Chu Peihan disliked studying apparently.She would skip her classes to play outside, and definitely wasn\u2019t willing to study while she was free.However, Chu Peihan could always earn high scores even though she hated studying so much.And there would be some students who always earn low scores no matter how hard they studied.Actually, if you wanted to have a high score, you needed to be clever and active in thinking, instead of remembering everything in the books.Chu Peihan was the kind of smart girl who knew how to make full use of her knowledge.Besides, she did spend some time on studying. It wasn\u2019t enough to be clever only.\u201cI\u2019ll go with you!\u201dThough Yu Mixi studied hard, she needed to relax as well.Yu Mixi was one of the top 10 excellent students in her class. She was hopeful to get into a great university if she could do well in the entrance exam.Yu Mixi knew when to unwind, and when to study hard.Thus, the three of them went to a small forest afterwards.Although Yu Mixi felt slightly uneasy with Chu Peihan, she didn\u2019t receive any unkindness from Chu Peihan. Yu Mixi gradually relaxed herself.Gu Ning actually noticed the fear from Yu Mixi to Chu Peihan, but she didn\u2019t say anything.She wanted Yu Mixi to feel and judge on her own.Meanwhile, Chen Ziyao had gone to the infirmary and applied some ointment, but her face was still red and swollen. She had to go back home afterwards.The break time soon past, and the three girls went back to their classrooms.Every time Gu Ning went into her classroom, she would receive many unkind looks, but this time, Gu Ning found there were fewer unkind looks.Many of her classmates had already witnessed what Gu Ning had done to Shao Feifei this morning, and then heard about the drama in the canteen. They now knew Gu Ning was certainly different.Still, there were some students believed Gu Ning had found herself a lot of troubles.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care actually. She just wanted to stay alone.She would only fight against someone who stood in her way.Shao Feifei and her friends deliberately escaped from Gu Ning\u2019s sight.The afternoon classes were over after a short time. Gu Ning went to have meal with Yu Mixi as usual.They didn\u2019t meet Qin Zheng, but Mu Ke instead.The minute Mu Ke saw Gu Ning, his eyes brightened. He immediately ran to Gu Ning.\u201cGu Ning, what a coincidence! Let me buy you a meal,\u201d Mu Ke said.\u201cWhy?\u201d Gu Ning asked. She wasn\u2019t familiar with Mu Ke actually.Seeing Mu Ke being so polite, Gu Ning knew he must have something to talk to her.Mu Ke scratched his head with shyness, then answered directly, \u201cWell, I saw what you\u2019ve done yesterday on the street, and I want you to teach me.\u201dThough Mu Ke didn\u2019t like fighting normally, he loved watching action shows.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Yu Mixi was confused. She didn\u2019t understand what they were talking about.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t show much yesterday. Aren\u2019t you afraid that I was just pretending, and I know nothing about kung fu?\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t answer Mu Ke\u2019s question immediately, but asked him back.\u201cEven though I\u2019m wrong, it\u2019s the undeniable truth that you\u2019re better than me at kung fu. If you\u2019re willing to take me as your apprentice, that will be the best.\u201d Mu Ke looked at Gu Ning sincerely.If Gu Ning had been an ordinary girl, she wouldn\u2019t have been able to knock down three men easily.She must be a master of kung fu!Mu Ke was worried that Gu Ning would reject his proposal, so he added, \u201cPlease, I won\u2019t bother you when you\u2019re studying. You can teach me when you\u2019re free. And, I can pay for your classes, or do whatever you ask me to do. Anything.\u201dMu Ke said in all sincerity to show his determination.Actually, Mu Ke hit the point.Gu Ning hesitated before, but now felt touched.She thought of An Qian.Gu Ning lacked of friends now, while Mu Ke was from a powerful family. She might need his help someday in the future.Gu Ning admitted she did this for her own good, but also because Mu Ke was a good guy and would be a good friend.Thus, Gu Ning replied, \u201cI can teach you if you like, but you don\u2019t need to be my apprentice. I don\u2019t want your money neither. All I want are your help and support.\u201d\u201cRea-really?\u201d Mu Ke was excited that Gu Ning agreed.\u201cSince all our classes are over now, I\u2019m free, and I can teach you later,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cRea-really?\u201d Mu Ke asked again with excitement. It was too good to be true for him. \u201cSure, sure, sure,\u201d he said.Mu Ke repeated his word for several times to show his happiness. He would have jumped up high if Gu Ning hadn\u2019t been here.Then, Mu Ke invited Gu Ning once again to have meal with him. Gu Ning accepted. She, along with Yu Mixi, followed Mu Ke towards the second floor of the canteen.Yu Mixi was still curious about the discussion between the two, but didn\u2019t know how to ask for more information.Though Gu Ning had said there was no need for Mu Ke to be her apprentice, Mu Ke insisted to call Gu Ning boss in order to have a closer connection with her.Gu Ning was reluctant as first. She didn\u2019t like to be called boss actually.However, Mu Ke insisted to call her boss or master.Compared with master, boss was more acceptable for Gu Ning.During the meal, Mu Ke called Gu Ning boss all the time. He actively served Gu Ning without any complaint, which raised much attention from students around them.Gu Ning felt embarrassed, and stopped Mu Ke from doing that.If Yu Mixi hadn\u2019t found out the truth from their discussion, she would also have believed Mu Ke was in love with Gu Ning, and was chasing her!When Yu Mixi was told that Gu Ning had beaten down a man by a single hit, she was more than astonished.But when she thought of what had happened this morning between Gu Ning and Shao Feifei, she believed Gu Ning was really powerful.All of a sudden, Yu Mixi admired Gu Ning more.\u201cGu Ning, would you please teach me as well?\u201d Yu Mixi almost begged.\u201cSure,\u201d Gu Ning answered quickly.Gu Ning actually hoped Yu Mixi could learn some kung fu to protect herself at least.But she would never force Yu Mixi to learn. It all depended on herself.If Yu Mixi was just passionate about it for a very short time, then gave up, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t bother to teach her, but if Yu Mixi was determined, Gu Ning was ready to train her like a professional fighter.After the meal, three of them walked straight to the small forest. There were few people there. They didn\u2019t want to bother others and vice versa.Since Gu Ning had promised to teach them, she must show her real ability. She needed to let them believe that she was a real master of kung fu.Thus Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate at all. She beat Mu Ke down to the ground within one move.Mu Ke was struck dumb, not by pain, but by shock.Though Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate, her body wasn\u2019t in a very good condition now. Her strength was limited. Mu Ke felt the pain, but was safe.A fighter must learn and grow from his pain.Yu Mixi, who was standing aside, was amazed with her mouth open. She now admired Gu Ning more than ever.Amazing. This was so amazing.\u201cGet back to your feet now,\u201d Gu Ning criticized Mu Ke, who was still lying on the ground.Since Gu Ning decided to teach them, she would be a strict teacher.Outstanding students were trained by the strict teachers.Gu Ning valued quality and efficiency most, so she wouldn\u2019t allow them to waste time.Mu Ke immediately stood up, and focused on his training.Gu Ning intended to let Mu Ke understand the skills quickly, so she attacked Mu Ke with full force afterwards.Of course, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t physically abuse Mu Ke. She adjusted her move according to Mu Ke\u2019s ability. Gu Ning wanted Mu Ke to experience the pain and skills together during the training.After a while, Mu Ke suffered a lot from the pain around his body.Though he was in great pain, Mu Ke wasn\u2019t willing to stop or give up. He faced his challenge with courage.Yu Mixi was totally absorbed in watching the training. Every time Mu Ke shouted out in pain, she would tremble at the same time, like she was the one who was being beaten.Although there were few people in this wood, Mu Ke\u2019s shout attracted several students\u2019 attention.Seeing a boy beaten down by a girl, they were all astonished. Some boys even raised their voices.\u201cWhat the f*ck, this girl is too powerful! The boy isn\u2019t able to fight back at all!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24\u201cExactly, let me take a video of them, then upload it onto our school\u2019s forum. Ha-ha.\u201dA boy took out his phone, and was ready to shoot.But before he started, Gu Ning and Mu Ke stopped.\u201cWhy stop? Go on! I\u2019m about to shoot,\u201d the boy raised his voice with anxiety.Gu Ning looked at the boy coldly. She walked towards him, \u201cWell, why don\u2019t you have a try and fight with me?\u201dIf the boy took a video of them and put it on their school\u2019s forum, everyone would know it. Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to get into trouble.The boy was frightened, then immediately rejected, \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for that\u2026\u201dThen he stepped back far away in case Gu Ning would hit him like the boy on the ground.Once Gu Ning and Mu Ke stopped fighting, the onlookers dispersed gradually.\u201cHey, boss, you\u2019re much more powerful than I thought you would be. I am right.\u201d Mu Ke was in great pain now, but he struggled to ran to Gu Ning. He looked so excited, like he was the master of kung fu, instead of Gu Ning.Gu Ning smiled back, but she felt upset in her heart.Compared with ordinary people, she was quite good, but compared with herself, Gu Ning knew she was still weak.She was merely as good as herself in the last incarnation.\u201cHow are you now?\u201d Yu Mixi asked Mu Ke with worry.She knew Mu Ke suffered a lot from the beating by Gu Ning, but couldn\u2019t help asking when he put on a casual face.\u201cI\u2019m absolutely in pain, but it\u2019s quite normal. You learn and improve from the pain!\u201d Mu Ke replied. He enjoyed it so much.At this moment, Gu Ning said to Yu Mixi seriously, \u201cMixi, it\u2019s never easy to learn kung fu. If you really want to be a master, you must be prepared for continuous pain and injuries. Besides, you need to be determined as well. To train yourself like a fighter may help you to protect yourself in the future, but it\u2019s all up to you whether you want to learn or not.\u201dYu Mixi wasn\u2019t born in a rich family. She had been doing labor work to support her family when she was a little girl. Pain was her friend to some extent.Like what Gu Ning had said, it might be of great help in the future to train yourself like a fighter.Especially for a girl, knowing how to protect yourself was a great advantage.Thus Yu Mixi didn\u2019t give up. She accepted the training with courage.Yu Mixi had to learn from the very beginning because she know nothing about kung fu.Gu Ning didn\u2019t demand Yu Mixi that she should run to school from her home every morning. It was dangerous. She asked Yu Mixi to arrive at school earlier, then began to run.At the beginning, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t very strict with Yu Mixi. She allowed Yu Mixi to practice according to her ability.\u2026Qin Zheng somehow heard of the news that Mu Ke had invited Gu Ning to dine with him. In the evening class, Qin Zheng asked Mu Ke, \u201cI heard that you\u2019ve bought Gu Ning a meal. Why?\u201dQin Zheng honestly didn\u2019t know why he would ask Mu Ke. Since he had already broken up with Gu Ning, it was none of his business that Gu Ning had her meal with whom.But Qin Zheng couldn\u2019t control himself.\u201cNothing, I just met her on a road, then bought her a meal,\u201d Mu Ke didn\u2019t tell Qin Zheng everything.Qin Zheng apparently wasn\u2019t satisfied with the answer. He couldn\u2019t help but criticize Mu Ke, \u201cSince when you\u2019ve been so familiar with Gu Ning and didn\u2019t fill me in?\u201dMu Ke was irritated by Qin Zheng\u2019s criticism, \u201cQin Zheng, what\u2019s wrong with you? She\u2019s not your girlfriend any longer. Why can\u2019t I have a meal with her?\u201dThough Mu Ke and Qin Zheng spent lots of time together. They weren\u2019t close. Mu Ke didn\u2019t care to argue with Qin Zheng.Moreover, Gu Ning now had an important position in Mu Ke\u2019s heart. He would stand up for Gu Ning without doubt.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qin Zheng was slightly mad, but he soon realized it was none of his business, so he closed his mouth.It was half past nine. The evening class was over.Those students who were from a rich family would be picked up by a car, while the rest would take a taxi or a bus.Gu Ning, on the contrary, wouldn\u2019t take a taxi, or a bus. She ran.Although the district where Gu Ning lived was under reconstruction and unsafe, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t afraid at all.It wasn\u2019t the first time that she went back home alone at night. She had never been in danger before.However, tonight was different.A black van ceased in front of Gu Ning at short notice. Three young men got off from the car, and went straight to Gu Ning.Every man had tattoos around their arms. They seemed like hoodlums.\u201cYou\u2019re Gu Ning, right?\u201d The head of the three asked with certainty.\u201cWho sent you?\u201d Gu Ning wasn\u2019t scared, but inquired calmly.Though she had no idea who was behind them, she knew they must be sent by Shao Feifei or Chen Ziyao.\u201cDon\u2019t you know whom you\u2019ve had bad blood with?\u201d another man mocked.\u201cToo many to remember.\u201d Gu Ning said.Now, the three hoodlums noticed Gu Ning had remained calm all the time. She wasn\u2019t terrified at all.They felt shamed, but were curious at the same time.\u201cGee, what a brave girl! Now I know why you dared to have bad blood with the daughter from the Shao Family.\u201d This time, the hoodlum directly revealed the people behind them.It was Shao Feifei. Gu Ning wasn\u2019t surprised neither.\u201cThen, so what?\u201d Gu Ning asked airily.\u201cShe wants us to rape you, then post the video on the Internet.\u201d The hoodlum told Gu Ning everything. He didn\u2019t care whether Gu Ning knew it or not, because they were going to do it anyway.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Even those hoodlums had to admit that this female student before them was unusually beautiful.They had played around with many female students before, but no one was as pretty as Gu Ning.On the other side, Gu Ning was extremely mad now.To rape her and take a video, Shao Feifei had crossed the line once more.\u201cIn your dreams, idiots!\u201d Gu Ning was annoyed. She kicked straight at the leading hoodlum\u2019s d*ck.The man didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning would attack him, and even that fast. Before he could escape, he was hit right away.A scream sounded loud in the cold night, which was utterly frightening.The man bent on his knees on the ground in great pain. He covered his d*ck with both hands. Beads of sweat around his forehead.The other two men were scared, and even wanted to run away. They comforted themselves that even a broken clock was right twice a day. Gu Ning was merely a teenage girl.Then, the two swore at Gu Ning, trying to punch her with fists.Gu Ning threw her backpack on the first man\u2019s face directly with great force. The man was hit down and knocked on their van.Within a second, Gu Ning lifted her foot, kicking the second before her. This man was much taller than Gu Ning, so she almost fell when she kicked on his lap.Gu Ning threw her backpack in hand once more, aiming at the man\u2019s head. The second man was caught right away, then fell down on the ground.At the same time, the first man got a steel pipe from the van. He ran to Gu Ning afterwards. Gu Ning stepped back at once.But before Gu Ning could fight again, a shadow sprang out from a corner. He hit the back of the three hoodlums\u2019 neck separately without any hesitation. Those hoodlums immediately fell into unconsciousness.It all happened too fast. Though Gu Ning had seen it clearly, she had no idea how the man was able to do that.Gu Ning smelt the disgusting flavor of blood before she could see the man\u2019s face. She frowned unconsciously.The man was injured.The next second, Gu Ning\u2019s sight fell on the man.The minute the man walked into Gu Ning\u2019s sight, Gu Ning was amazed by his appearance.This man was extraordinarily handsome.He probably was the most handsome man Gu Ning had ever met till now.The man was in a suit of black clothes. He was around 6\u20193\u201d tall and 25 years old. His features were beautiful and delicate. Only his skin was a little pale.Probably the man had lost much blood because of his injuries, thus he looked pale now.Although the man was injured, he seemed dangerous still, especially his deep dark eyes. Even Gu Ning felt threatened.The man was so powerful!He must be an extraordinary man.\u201cDo you drive?\u201d Suddenly, the man said with coldness but politely.\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning answered at once.\u201cDrive me to the Fenghua Luxury Mansion. This is your reward,\u201d the man said, and took out a green jade in the size of a quail egg to Gu Ning.Seeing it was jade, Gu Ning unconsciously used her Jade Eyes.Then she was amazed again, because there was a thick white fog around the jade.Gu Ning knew little about jade, but she could tell this jade must be expensive from its power.The man must be of great wealth!\u201cGreat, deal.\u201dGu Ning answered without further delay. She took the jade over directly before the man could tell her the value of it.The man was a little surprised for Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate at all. Did she knew this jade was real?If she knew the jade was authentic at the first sight, she must be a special girl.Anyway, the man made a deal with Gu Ning.Besides, the jade was real indeed, and was worth of dozens of million yuan.A deal was made based on the willingness of both sides.Though Gu Ning made the deal with the man only because she wanted the jade, the man wouldn\u2019t criticize her for that, because she earned it herself.The man turned around and got in the car. He wasn\u2019t worried that Gu Ning would regret after she had taken the jade.When the man turned around, Gu Ning immediately put the jade into the telepathic eye space.The second the jade was in the telepathic eye space, everything became clearer before Gu Ning\u2019s eyes. She felt relaxed too.The jade was helpful indeed.Now, Gu Ning had a stronger desire to collect more jade, but she had to wait till weekends.Gu Ning got into the black van without delay. She started the car and left.And the three hoodlums were left on the street.\u201cWell, are you alright? Do you want me to help you with your injuries?\u201d Out of politeness, Gu Ning asked the man.\u201cNo, thanks,\u201d The man answered. He had no intention to talk.Since the man didn\u2019t want her help, Gu Ning closed her mouth.After a few seconds, Gu Ning suddenly realized she had made a bad decision. She drove the hoodlums\u2019 car away directly. What if they sued her for stealing?And there were surveillance cameras around the street. They couldn\u2019t deny it!Thinking of that, Gu Ning slammed on the brakes. The man, who was sitting at the back seat, flew ahead.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d The man asked with dissatisfaction. His voice sounded much weaker than before.\u201cWe just grabbed others\u2019 car. What if I\u2019m sued for stealing? There are surveillance cameras on the street. I can\u2019t deny it!\u201d Gu Ning was worried. She didn\u2019t want to be caught into the police station.\u201cRelax, you won\u2019t be involved.\u201d The man said. His voice with determination comforted Gu Ning. She didn\u2019t waste more time, and drove away.Before long, Gu Ning\u2019s phone rang. Without looking at the caller\u2019s ID, Gu Ning knew whom it was.It must be Gu Man.Gu Ning immediately took out her phone. It was Gu Man indeed. She answered the call at once. Before she could say a word, Gu Man\u2019s anxious voice sounded, \u201cNingning, where are you now? How come you\u2019re not home yet?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Normally, Gu Ning would be home 20 minutes earlier. And now Gu Man was worried about her.Gu Ning instantly comforted her mother, \u201cMom, let me explain. My classmate has sprained her ankle by accident. I\u2019m sending her home now. Please don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll be right back home as long as she\u2019s home.\u201dHearing this, Gu Man was relieved. She always trusted her daughter. \u201cGreat, you must be careful yourself,\u201d Gu Man said.\u201cI will, mom. Bye-bye,\u201d Gu Ning said. She breathed out a long breath.Gu Ning didn\u2019t notice that the man at the back was a little upset and envious while she was talking to her mother.Fenghua Luxury Mansion was the best living area in City F. It was near downtown, quiet and had the best location, amenities as well as environment. People who lived in Fenghua Luxury Mansion were either the rich or the authorities.Gu Ning\u2019s eldest uncle, Gu Qinxiang, had always wanted to buy a house in Fenghua Luxury Mansion, but it was too expensive to afford.Each house cost at least five or six million yuan.Though Gu Qingxiang has millions of wealth, he couldn\u2019t afford it.Gu Qingxiang\u2019s assets included his movable and immovable property, while his movable property was merely around eight million. He also needed much money to run his company. If he used the money to buy a house, his company would go bankrupt.Gu Ning, on the contrary, had made her mind to buy a house for Gu Man and Gu Qing\u2019s family respectively in Fenghua Luxury Mansion.Gu Ning was a skillful driver. She drove fast and steadily.Twenty minutes later, they arrived at Fenghua Luxury Mansion.The man got off the car the minute it stopped.\u201cDrive the car back to where it has been. I\u2019ll handle the surveillance cameras. You don\u2019t need to worry,\u201d the man said, then turned around walking towards the gate.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care that the man was being cold. She knew that was the way the man behaved.Besides, they were merely strangers.Gu Ning drove the car back afterwards.Another 20 minutes later, Gu Ning was back while the hoodlums were gone already.Gu Ning had no idea whether those hoodlums had woken up and left on their own, or someone had discovered them then called the police. They might have been sent to the hospital.Though the man had promised Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t be involved, Gu Ning still wanted to stay away from what had happened tonight. She parked the car, then ran to her home.Far away from the building they lived in, Gu Ning saw Gu Man standing at the entrance of an alley. All of a sudden, Gu Ning felt like crying. She ran ahead, and called Gu Man with love, \u201cMom.\u201dGu Man treated Gu Ning so well, which moved Gu Ning and made her feel guilty at the same time. She shouldn\u2019t have let Gu Man be concerned.Seeing Gu Ning was fine, Gu Man was finally relieved, \u201cNingning, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m good, mom. Let\u2019s go back home!\u201d Gu Ning replied. She held Gu Man\u2019s arm, leaning close to Gu Man like a little girl.Gu Man wore a happy face. The mother and her daughter went home together. Their shadows became longer and longer under a street lamp.In a luxurious bedroom, the man was half-naked, lying on the bed.There were many wounds around his body. Most were gunshot wounds that had already become ugly scars. Some of them were extremely unsightly.Meanwhile, there were two bleeding holes on his left shoulder and waist. They were new wounds.A family doctor was administering medicine to him, then wrapped his wounds.The man was exactly the one who had made a deal with Gu Ning, and let her drive him back.After a while, the family doctor left. A man in a grey Armani casual suit walked inside.He was around 25 years old with white smooth skin. His eyes were deep dark and charming. Thick eyebrows, Grecian nose and perfect lips, all showed the man\u2019s elegance and nobility.\u201cI\u2019ve handled the surveillance cameras. Nothing left.\u201d The man said with pride, almost showing off his ability.\u201cGreat.\u201d A simple answer.The man asked with curiosity, \u201cShaoting, how did you manage to come back? And why do you need to destroy the tapes of those surveillance cameras along the way home?\u201d\u201cSomeone sent me home, but we stole a car. No evidence should be left.\u201d So the tapes of the surveillance cameras must be destroyed.Leng Shaoting said calmly, but the man was shocked.\u201cWhat? You stole a car?\u201d It was so unbelievable that Leng Shaoting would do that.\u201cEnough, I need some rest. You can leave now.\u201d Before the man could ask more, Leng Shaoting forced him to leave.The man felt aggrieved. This was his house after all. How could the guest force the host to leave?The man was upset, but not dared to say it out.Thus he left the bedroom reluctantly, and closed the door for Leng Shaoting.Leng Shaoting couldn\u2019t sleep. He just wanted to stay alone.The next day, Gu Ning got up at 5:40. She spent 10 minutes on brushing teeth and washing face. At 5:50, she left her home, running to her school.Half an hour later, Gu Ning arrived at school. She bought herself breakfast, heading to the football field while eating on the way.Gu Ning finished her breakfast on her way to the football field.When she finally arrived, Mu Ke and Yu Mixi were already there. Both of them were running.The two apparently wanted to learn kung fu well.Gu Ning joined them afterwards.\u201cGu Ning, good morning.\u201d Seeing Gu Ning was here, Mu Ke and Yu Mixi greeted her at the same time.Mu Ke breathed steadily, while Yu Mixi sounded weak.\u201cHow many circles do you have already?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cThree,\u201d the two answered.Gu Ning was satisfied with the answer. A circle around this football field was about 400 meters. Three circles amounted to 1,200 meters. Yu Mixi had done well, given she wasn\u2019t physically strong.\u201cVery well. Mixi, if it\u2019s possible, you can have another two circles. If you can\u2019t do it, it\u2019s fine. You can stop right away.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Yu Mixi was exhausted now. Another two circles were a big challenge for her. Thus Gu Ning didn\u2019t give her much pressure.As for Mu Ke, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t hesitate to torture him.\u201cMu Ke, run after me at the same speed, now,\u201d Gu Ning said, then ran ahead first.Mu Ke immediately followed up.He had intentionally slowed his pace down when he had been running with Yu Mixi. Now with Gu Ning, he could enjoy the feeling of running like a wild horse.Though Gu Ning was running fast, she knew this wasn\u2019t a race.Mu Ke knew it as well. Physical training wasn\u2019t the same thing as race. He didn\u2019t run pass Gu Ning on purpose, but remained behind her.After a circle, Mu Ke started to be out of breath. Two circles later, Mu Ke fought for his breath. After three circles, Mu Ke was exhausted and gradually was left behind by Gu Ning.Then Mu Ke found out Gu Ning\u2019s pace of running was all the same, no matter how many circles she had run.Even every step was of the same length, when Gu Ning was running.Though there was several centimeters difference, it could be omitted.Mu Ke was 100% sure that Gu Ning must have received professional training for years.He was more respectful and curious about Gu Ning now.Seeing Gu Ning and Mu Ke had already finished three circles, Yu Mixi felt envious. She wish she had been as physically strong as them.No pain, no gain. Yu Mixi knew it clearly. Gu Ning and Mu Ke had trained themselves for many years, while she had just started to exercise.Yu Mixi was envious, but not jealous. She made up her mind to do better than herself.As long as she was determined, she could be as strong as Gu Ning and Mu Ke one day in the future.Four circles later, Mu Ke was far behind Gu Ning. He could barely breathe, and his pace slowed down gradually.Mu Ke actually was physically strong. Running fast cost much more strength than running slowly. Five circles of running at a fast pace was equal to dozens of circles at a slow pace.Even Gu Ning had to stop after six circles of fast running.She was able to continue, but wasn\u2019t willing to.\u201cGu-Gu Ning, you, you\u2019re incredible! You can keep the same length of each step, and run at the same pace. Wow!\u201d Mu Ke actually stopped after five circles.He was out of breath, and felt thirsty.He kept walking for a while, because he knew he couldn\u2019t sit down right after running.\u201cYou\u2019ll get used to it,\u201d Gu Ning replied while catching her breath.When Gu Ning and Mu Ke had finished their circles, Yu Mixi was completely tired after two circles. She could barely stand, but struggled to finish her training.Gu Ning walked over and stopped her, \u201cIt\u2019s alright. You\u2019ve done very well today. Let\u2019s have a walk first, then take a rest.\u201dYu Mixi immediately leaned against Gu Ning. She felt dizzy and unable to walk by herself.After a long while, Yu Mixi finally recovered. Gu Ning pulled out two bottles of water from her backpack, handing them to Mu Ke and Yu Mixi. Then she took out another bottle for herself.Gu Ning bought the water on her way to football field. She knew they would be in great need of water after running.\u201cThanks,\u201d Mu Ke and Yu Mixi thanked Gu Ning. They both opened the bottle immediately, and poured the water into their mouth, like they hadn\u2019t had water for many days.It was five minutes away from the morning class. They went back to classroom together.They planned to continue their training when they were free.Shao Feifei was in good mood today. She assumed those hoodlums she had hired had successfully done what she had asked them to do. Though she hadn\u2019t received their call, Shao Feifei believed Gu Ning wasn\u2019t able to fight with several men.Probably those hoodlums were too happy to call her.\u201cFeifei, what has happened? You look so pleased today.\u201d\u201cExactly, tell us now!\u201dYang Yulu and Wu Qingya didn\u2019t know what Shao Feifei had secretly done. They asked with curiosity.\u201cIt is a good news, but it\u2019s not a great time to tell you. I\u2019ll let you know when we finish the classes today,\u201d Shao Feifei replied.Though Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya were curious, they didn\u2019t dare to force Shao Feifei to tell them.It was two minutes away from the morning class. Everyone was in the classroom, except Gu Ning and Yu Mixi.Seeing Gu Ning was absent, Shao Feifei was more certain that Gu Ning had been in trouble. She put on a big smile.But next, Shao Feifei\u2019s smile froze on her face. She looked frightened even.It was Gu Ning. She showed up at the door of the classroom.Gu Ning had no idea whether Shao Feifei knew the truth or not. She only understood Shao Feifei\u2019s face must be \u201cinteresting\u201d when she appeared. Thus the minute Gu Ning walked in the classroom, she stared at Shao Feifei.Noticing Shao Feifei being in shock, Gu Ning knew Shao Feifei wasn\u2019t aware that her plan had failed.\u201cGu Ning, why are you here?\u201d Shao Feifei jumped up from her desk.Everyone around her was confused. This was classroom, and Gu Ning was supposed to attend the classes. What was wrong with that?\u201cOh, If I\u2019m not here, where should I be?\u201d Gu Ning asked Shao Feifei with provocation.\u201cDidn\u2019t you\u2026\u201d The second Shao Feifei opened her mouth, she realized she shouldn\u2019t have done that. So she immediately shut her mouth.Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t let her get away with it easily. She asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cNo-nothing.\u201d Though Shao Feifei didn\u2019t know what exactly had happened yesterday and she was more than disappointed now, she knew she had to keep it a secret.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28\u201cReally?\u201d Gu Ning apparently didn\u2019t believe her. \u201cWhy do you even ask me why I\u2019m here? This is my classroom. If I\u2019m not here, where should I be?\u201d Gu Ning continued.\u201cI-I, I\u2026\u201d Shao Feifei panicked. She didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya knew Shao Feifei so well. They immediately understood Shao Feifei must had done something to Gu Ning secretly. She probably assumed she had succeeded. That was the reason why she was so happy today.But Gu Ning appeared as usual, Shao Feifei was surprised and felt guilty.Shao Feifei didn\u2019t dare to tell the truth. Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya both shut their mouth too. They were also unwilling to add fuel on the flames, in case Shao Feifei would blame them for that later.Luckily, the bell rang, and it was time for the morning reading class. The head teacher was here as well. Gu Ning let go of Shao Feifei, then went to her seat.There would be ample time ahead.Besides, Gu Ning had no intention to reveal the truth. She preferred to torture her opponents without others\u2019 knowing.Seeing Gu Ning walk away, Shao Feifei breathed out.She was annoyed to herself for feeling guilty. What would Gu Ning do even if she found out the truth? Gu Ning was merely a poor girl. She couldn\u2019t do anything to hurt Shao Feifei.After that, Shao Feifei didn\u2019t feel guilty at all. She glared at Gu Ning with intense hatred.She believed Gu Ning had only been lucky to have escaped away yesterday. It wasn\u2019t the end of the story. Shao Feifei started to plan her next step.Gu Ning actually received the unkind look from Shao Feifei, but she ignored it.The headteacher left after a while.Although Gu Ning\u2019s eyes were on her book, she was busy thinking something about herself in her mind\u2014How to build her power?It wasn\u2019t as easy as making money.Without power and sources, you could never build your empire only with money.Property and sources were an important step.But before that, Gu Ning needed to have enough money.For Gu Ning, stone gambling was the quickest way to make money. She had the Jade Eyes, and she would never lose. However, she wasn\u2019t able to gamble on stones anywhere she wanted. It wasn\u2019t convenient.The main origins of stones were Burma and Province Y. They were both far away from City F.There was no direct plane from City F to Province Y. One needed to spend around two hours on waiting before transferring to the destination. Thus it took around seven hours from City F to Province Y. Gu Ning only had her weekends. She didn\u2019t have enough time for that.Moreover, she was a senior in a high school, and under great academic pressure. It wasn\u2019t easy to ask days off and her mother Gu Man wouldn\u2019t allow her to leave school as well.Thus, Gu Ning had to choose a nearest city with stone gambling.Which city allowed stone gambling? Gu Ning had no idea. She needed to look up on the Internet. Unfortunately, her phone was too old to surf the Internet.Right at that moment, Gu Ning realized the importance of a great phone.As for her start-up fund, she only had 110 thousand yuans, which was barely enough. She couldn\u2019t buy a single stone with all her savings.Therefore, Gu Ning intended to sell the jade that the man had given her yesterday.She had already absorbed the power of the jade anyway. It was useless to her now. Once she was rich, she could buy whatever jade she wanted.Though the power had been absorbed, the jade was still of excellent quality.Gu Ning was a doer, instead of a talker. When they had a break at noon, Gu Ning left her school immediately after she had told Yu Mixi that they would continue the class in the afternoon.The minute Gu Ning walked out the gate of her school, she went on a taxi to the downtown.The downtown wasn\u2019t far away. Gu Ning arrived there after 20 minutes.She went straight to a phone shop, and bought a homemade mobile phone with the best equipment. If she had had a good reason, she would have bought another one for Gu Man.Gu Ning left the phone shop, going inside a plaza. She found herself a well-decorated restaurant to have meal first. Then she surfed the Internet about the knowledge of jade.Since she was going to be in touch with the jade, it was better to know it well first.For now, Gu Ning wanted to find out the quality and value of the jade in her hand. She was going to sell it at a good price.In Gu Ning\u2019s mind, a jewelry store was the only way to sell her jade. In that way, the jade could be sold out at a good price.And the jewelry store was always willing to buy a jade of high quality.Gu Ning knew she probably wouldn\u2019t get the highest price in the market, but the price wouldn\u2019t be low.But she was totally shocked when she found out the background of this jade.Gu Ning knew this jade was of excellent quality, but didn\u2019t expect it to be that valuable. It was the top King\u2019s Green.The King\u2019s Green was rare in the market, and was super expensive.A ring made of the King\u2019s Green was worth of around a million yuan in the market. Its price could even be higher at auction.The King\u2019s Green in Gu Ning\u2019s hand was as big as a quail\u2019s egg. It weighed 10 times heavier than a ring.That was to say, if it was sold according to its weight, it was worth two million yuan in the market, at least.At auction, it could be sold out at the price of several million.The price could be higher though.Thinking of the price of the King\u2019s Green, Gu Ning breathed in a long breath. The man had been so generous to give her such a valuable jade.The rich was really different from the poor.What Gu Ning didn\u2019t know was the King\u2019s Green meant nothing to Leng Shaoting. In Leng Shaoting\u2019s eyes, it was just a stone. He would have already thrown it away if the jade hadn\u2019t been so valuable.He had carried the King\u2019s Green with him, only because his good friend wanted it. He had planned to send it to his friend as a gift, but had ended up giving it to Gu Ning.But Gu Ning was a poor senior student now. She had no idea how to sell the jade at auction.Besides, there was no auction in City F.Gu Ning didn\u2019t have time, nor method to put her jade up for auction.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Gu Ning was satisfied even though she could only sell it at the market price.She found an old jade store named \u201cYicui Jade-store\u201d with a hundred years of history on the Internet. It wasn\u2019t big, but had great fame.Because the boss of this Yicui Jade-store was the head of the jade association in City F. The jade in Yicui Jade-store was also well-known for its good quality and reasonable price.Thus, Gu Ning made up her mind to go to Yicui Jade-store which had a history of 100 years.Though Gu Ning didn\u2019t know much about Yicui Jade-store and she also had no idea whether it was as fair and good as those Internet users said online, she would like to trust Yicui Jade-store more than a common jewelry store.She knew the value the jade anyway. If she didn\u2019t get a satisfactory price, she wouldn\u2019t sell it then.The flagship store of Yicui Jade-store was in the antique market, but it also had many branches in many plaza.Right now, Gu Ning was in a commercial building in the downtown. She decided to go to Yicui Jade-store later.After the research, Gu Ning put her phone and the jade into her backpack and started to eat afterwards.After her meal, she went straight to Yicui Jade-store.The jewelry stores were on the second floor of the building. It took Gu Ning a while before she found Yicui Jade-store. Yicui Jade-store wasn\u2019t big, and was decorated in a retro style. All the workers inside were in cheongsam.The minute Gu Ning walked inside, a saleswoman stepped forward to her. Gu Ning had received a polite greeting as well, though she was a student. She now immediately had a high opinion of Yicui Jade-store.\u201cMiss, what can I do for you?\u201d the saleswoman asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s your best jade here?\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cThe best emerald we have is this one. It\u2019s of great quality. The color is bright light green. Then we have this violet emerald. It\u2019s very rare and we don\u2019t have many jewelry of it. If you want, you can book first,\u201d the saleswoman said.\u201cDo you have the King\u2019s Green here?\u201d Gu Ning asked.The saleswoman was a little embarrassed, then said, \u201cSorry, the King\u2019s Green is the rarest kind of emerald. I\u2019ve worked in this industry for many years, and I\u2019ve never seen the King\u2019s Green in my career.\u201d\u201cThen do you buy in emerald?\u201d Gu Ning inquired.The saleswoman was a little surprised now. She had no idea what Gu Ning wanted to do. Out of politeness, she still answered, \u201cWe do buy in some emeralds of high quality at eight-tenths price of the market price.\u201dEight-tenths, that was fair.\u201cGreat, can I see your manager here please? I want to sell a King\u2019s Green of the size of a quail\u2019s egg,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cWhat? The King\u2019s Green?\u201dA male voice sounded with amazement.A good-looking man, who was around 25 years old and in a suit, strode towards Gu Ning from the door. He asked with excitement and doubt, \u201cDo you really have a King\u2019s Green of the size of a quail\u2019s egg?\u201dHearing the man\u2019s voice, the saleswoman finally recovered from the shocking news. She called the man with great respect, \u201cMr Qin.\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cCan I have a look please. If it\u2019s real, I\u2019ll buy it at the market price.\u201d Qin Yifan\u2019s eyes were full of anticipation.Though he couldn\u2019t believe a student would have the King\u2019s Green, he wouldn\u2019t mind to have a look.The King\u2019s Green was too rare to miss.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. Since I\u2019ve turned to Yicui Jade-store before you, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll only make a deal with you if Yicui Jade-store refuse to buy my jade,\u201d Gu Ning apologized to Qin Yifan.Gu Ning would like to sell her jade at the market price, but she had already accepted the price offered by Yicui Jade-store. She didn\u2019t want to break the rule.Qin Yifan and those workers in Yicui Jade-store were all surprised by Gu Ning\u2019s integrity. She would adhere to the rules.Everyone thought highly of Gu Ning now.\u201cUm, miss, this Mr. Qin is the son of our boss. You can make a deal with him directly,\u201d a saleswoman introduced.She smiled with sincerity due to her great impression of Gu Ning.He was the son of the boss of Yicui Jade-store? Gu Ning was a little amazed.\u201cNice to meet you. My name\u2019s Qin Yifan. My father owns Yicui Jade-store.\u201d Qin Yifan introduced himself to Gu Ning, reaching out his hand at the same time.\u201cNice to meet you too. I\u2019m Gu Ning.\u201d Gu Ning shook his hand lightly.\u201cThen, can we see the King\u2019s Green now, Miss?\u201d Qin Yifan asked without ado.\u201cSure,\u201d Gu Ning said. She used her backpack as the cover to pull out the King\u2019s Green from the telepathic eye space.The emerald hadn\u2019t been wrapped and packed at all. Qin Yifan and his workers were shocked again.If this was a real King\u2019s Green, wasn\u2019t she afraid that it would be scratched?Qin Yifan took the emerald then started to identify it.Qin Yifan was born in a family of jade. He had grown up with all kinds of jade, and was an expert to some extent.Though the King\u2019s Green was rare, he had seen it before.The King\u2019s Green was dark green, which was the most valuable green color among emeralds.Under the light, the King\u2019s Green shined in a special dark green. It looked like dark blue sometimes, then turned into light green. Its color changed in different lights.After a while, Qin Yifan was sure this one was the real King\u2019s Green.Qin Yifan was more than excited now. His hands were shaking even, \u201cThis is real. The real King\u2019s Green\u2026\u201d\u201cSince it\u2019s real, please give me a price, Mr Qin.\u201d Gu Ning had classes this afternoon. She didn\u2019t want to spend much time here.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30\u201cNo problem.\u201d Qin Yifan actually wanted to close this deal more than Gu Ning. He wanted to own the King\u2019s Green himself. \u201cBut Miss Gu, may I ask the source of this emerald?\u201dQin Yifan needed to know whether this emerald was from a legal source, so he wouldn\u2019t get into any trouble because of it.Gu Ning understood, so she didn\u2019t feel offended. \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry, it is from an absolute legal source,\u201d Gu Ning said.Hearing this, Qin Yifan was relieved, \u201cFrom the size and weight of this emerald, the market price would be over 10 million yuan. I will pay 10 million yuan for it. What would you say, Miss Gu?\u201dAlthough Gu Ning kind of knew the price of the King\u2019s Green, she was amazed by Qin Yifan\u2019s offer.Gu Ning could sell it for an even higher price in the market, but she was satisfied with Qin Yifan\u2019s offer.If she had brought it to another jewelry store, she probably wouldn\u2019t get such a generous offer.Ten million yuan were beyond her anticipation. Gu Ning was satisfied of course.Then they need to sign an agreement and transfer the money.Once the agreement had been signed, both sides couldn\u2019t regret.Gu Ning had signed the agreement and got the money, then was about to leave.Qin Yifan stopped her on her way out, \u201cMiss Gu, this is my name card. If you have any other emeralds of great quality, please feel free to call me.\u201dQin Yifan suddenly had the feeling that this girl wasn\u2019t an ordinary teenager. Besides, Gu Ning\u2019s good manners had impressed him.\u201cSure,\u201d Gu Ning accepted his name card willingly.She didn\u2019t need to tell him her phone number, because it was on the contract.Qin Yifan didn\u2019t bring his sight back until Gu Ning disappeared. He barely could look away from the King\u2019s Green in his hand.\u201cDon\u2019t tell the chairman about this. I want to surprise him,\u201d Qin Yifan said to his staff. His father\u2019s sixtieth birthday was around the corner. He wanted to carve a small object from this King\u2019s Green, and give it to his father as a birthday gift.Qin Yifan\u2019s father ran the business of jade. He had seen many kinds of jade. However, the King\u2019s Green was too rare that even Qin Yifan\u2019s father didn\u2019t have one.Though Gu Ning pretended to be calm, she felt nervous indeed.Two million. To be honest, she had never had that much money in hands in her last lifetime because of the control of the Tang family.Gu Ning was nervous, excited and couldn\u2019t believe it was true.She had checked the message several times, then accepted the fact. Gu Ning deleted the message afterwards in case someone else would find out.Though two million were a lot for Gu Ning, it wasn\u2019t enough for a start-up.She decided to use the two million as the fund of stone gambling.Gu Ning had searched the Internet. The stone gambling market in City G was the nearest one to City F. It took an hour of flight to get there. Gu Ning made a decision that she was going to City G this weekend.Without doubt, Gu Ning wanted to start up her business from the jewelry industry.She had Jade Eyes, and could gain money without risking anything of her own.Jewelry industry was just a beginning. Other industries would be involved in the future.The Tang family was involved in the real estate and entertainment industries. Gu Ning was determined to take part in those two industries. She was going to win the Tang family.Gu Ning also knew she must take it slowly. It wasn\u2019t easy to do a successful business. She needed both money and resources.For example, if she planned to establish a jewelry company, she had to prepare a lot for it.First was the source, then the store. After that, she needed to register a company. If she didn\u2019t know someone who was in charge, she wouldn\u2019t be able to finish it within a month.Workers, like designers, managers and engraving artists, were also needed.She was still a student now. It wasn\u2019t practical for her to manage the company on her own.Thinking of all these, Gu Ning felt burdened, but she enjoyed it.Moreover, after she went back home from City G with a large amount of money, she would to Gu Man something about what had happened. And she would buy Gu Man and the family of Gu Qing a house separately.She also wanted Gu Man to quit her job, which was tiring and only paid peanuts.If Gu Man was willing to be a housewife, Gu Ning was fine with that. If her mother wanted to develop her own interests, Gu Ning would support her mother too.Gu Man could open a small store, and hired someone to look after it for her. She could visit the store and work for a while if she liked. All Gu Ning wanted was to let her mother live a relaxing life.As for the family of Gu Qing, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t support them the way she supported Gu Man. She would only financially supported them if they needed.If they wanted to open a shop or a start-up, Gu Ning was willing to help them without payback.It was still early, Gu Ning went to a bookstore. She bought several books on jade and stones, then she put those books into the telepathic eye space in a washroom. After that, she left the commercial building, and went straight to her school by taxi.When Gu Ning was back at school, it was 2:20 pm, and 10 minutes away from the class. Gu Ning was on time.However, Gu Ning encountered Qin Zheng and Gu Xiaoxiao when she went upstairs.The minute Gu Xiaoxiao saw Gu Ning, she held Qin Zheng\u2019s arm and gave Gu Ning a provocative look.Gu Ning was speechless. Did Gu Xiaoxiao really believe she still likes Qin Zheng?Probably in Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning had liked Qin Zheng so much in the past, and it wasn\u2019t possible for her to forget him within a short time.Even though Qin Zheng had broken her heart, it took time to recover from the pain.Unfortunately, Gu Ning was different now. Qin Zheng was merely a stranger to her.Accordingly, Gu Ning ignored them, going straight upstairs. Gu Xiaoxiao was mad though for she didn\u2019t see Gu Ning being upset.But she still believed Gu Ning was pretending to be calm.Qin Zheng, on the contrary, was extremely upset.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Though he didn\u2019t like Gu Ning, he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that the girl, who had loved him so much, would ignore him suddenly.Qin Zheng was a selfish boy. He enjoyed being admired, and he was proud of himself being popular.The minute Gu Ning walked into the classroom, Shao Feifei looked at her unkindly. Honestly, Gu Ning was so sick of it.Yu Mixi immediately asked Gu Ning when she sat down, \u201cGu Ning, how\u2019s everything going?\u201d\u201cVery well,\u201d Gu Ning replied.The first class was English class. The teacher unexpectedly found fault with Gu Ning.Gu Ning knew the teacher did it on purpose for a reason.It was said that their English teacher, Chen Ming, was Chen Ziyao\u2019s uncle. Chen Ziyao must have told Chen Ming to pick on Gu Ning.\u201cGu Ning, translate this sentence into English,\u201d Chen Ming said.Gu Ning was well-known for her poor English. Chen Ming deliberately asked her to translate a whole paragraph. Even the student with the highest level of English in their class wouldn\u2019t be able to that.If one could translate two-thirds, he or she would do a fantastic job already.Thus, everyone knew Chen Ming was intentionally finding fault with Gu Ning.Although not knowing the reason, Shao Feifei and her friends were all pleased to see that. However, Gu Ning stood up calmly with confidence.A paragraph of authentic English came out from Gu Ning\u2019s mouth, which shocked everyone. Even Chen Ming, who was the English teacher, couldn\u2019t do the same.Gu Ning was poor in English before, but now, Gu Ning was different. English was her second language because she had received the training abroad in her last incarnation.In a foreign country for 10 years, it was fair enough that she could speak authentic English.If you didn\u2019t look at her face, you would mistake her for a native English-speaker.After the shock, Shao Feifei and her friends were utterly upset with envy and jealousy.Why? How come Gu Ning\u2019s English became so good?Chen Ming wore a displeased face. He now felt he had embarrassed himself.He had intended to pick on Gu Ning and remain decent at the same time.Though he was unhappy, he had to admit that Gu Ning had done a better job than him. So, he gave up his plan afterwards to save face.After the class, Yu Mixi looked at Gu Ning with great admiration and excitement, \u201cGu Ning, I have no idea that your English is so good!\u201d\u201cI can teach you if you want!\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cOf course, please!\u201d Yu Mixi was thrilled, because her English was poor as well.\u201cSo what? The poor girl is always the poor girl, no matter how good her English is.\u201d Shao Feifei couldn\u2019t stand that Gu Ning had won again. In her eyes, a poor girl could never change her fate.\u201cExactly,\u201d Yang Yulu and Wu Qingya agreed. They had been with Shao Feifei for too long to have a clear understanding of themselves.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care at all, while Yu Mixi felt attacked.The minute Chen Ming went back to his office, he sent a message to Chen Ziyao saying Gu Ning\u2019s English was too good to pick on.Chen Ziyao received the message, feeling irritated and disappointed, but Chen Ming clearly told her it wouldn\u2019t work, so she had to give up.The afternoon classes passed quickly. Before Gu Ning and Yu Mixi left their classroom, Mu Ke was already standing outside waiting for them, along with noisy discussions from many girls.\u201cWow, he\u2019s Mu Ke from the first classroom. Why is he here?\u201d\u201cIs he here for a girl in our class?\u201d\u201cWho will she be? I\u2019m jealous!\u201d\u201cExactly, I hope he\u2019s here for me.\u201d\u201cIn your dreams. You\u2019re definitely not his type!\u201d\u2026Though Mu Ke wasn\u2019t the most handsome boy in their school, he was outstanding enough. He was good at studying and basketball, plus a great family background, thus he was famous in 12th grade.\u201cMu Ke, who are you here for?\u201dGu Ning and Yu Mixi went outside. Meanwhile, Shao Feifei walked to Mu Ke and asked him the question.Shao Feifei looked shy. She now was nothing like the arrogant girl in normal days. Gu Ning instantly knew Shao Feifei liked Mu Ke.Unfortunately, Mu Ke didn\u2019t like her.\u201cI\u2019m here for\u2026\u201d Mu Ke wasn\u2019t arrogant, nor gentle, but he treated others with good manners.Thus he didn\u2019t ignore Shao Feifei\u2019s question.But before he could answer the question, he saw Gu Ning and Yu Mixi coming out. He immediately walk to them and left Shao Feifei alone, \u201cHey boss, Mixi, let\u2019s go dine together!\u201dBoss? Everyone around was astonished, and their eyes all rounded in surprise. They glanced at Mu Ke, then Gu Ning.What? Boss? Why did Mu Ke called Gu Ning \u201cBoss\u201d?What was going on?\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Gu Ning ignored everyone who was in shock, and left with Mu Ke together with Yu Mixi.After Gu Ning and her friends were gone for a while, everyone then got their mind back, and started to gossip.\u201cWhat? Did I hear it right? Mu Ke called Gu Ning his boss?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve heard it right, because we all have heard it.\u201d\u201cBut, it\u2019s so unreal! What has happened?\u201d\u201cWho knows!\u201d\u201cDoes Mu Ke like Gu Ning? Though Gu Ning is poor, she is pretty!\u201d\u201cThen why did Mu Ke called her his boss?\u201d\u201cProbably it\u2019s their way of romance!\u201d\u2026At the same time, Shao Feifei was more than annoyed. She yelled to herself in her heart with anger. She liked Mu Ke so much. Why would the boy choose Gu Ning?Gu Ning was nobody. She was merely a poor girl, and wasn\u2019t qualified to compare with Shao Feifei.Obviously, Shao Feifei believed Mu Ke admired Gu Ning.She wouldn\u2019t accept the fact, and she was determined to pay Gu Ning back.But, who would be the one to pay for it was still an unclear answer. Gu Ning apparently wasn\u2019t the one.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t care less about how people might gossip. Three of them went straight to the second floor. This meal was on Mu Ke as well.Yu Mixi felt a little uncomfortable, but Gu Ning was totally at ease.Qin Zheng, Zhang Yiming, Fu Mingliang, Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao were all rich kids. They all came to the private cafeteria to eat. When Gu Ning and her friends arrived, the two groups met each other.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Seeing Mu Ke was with Gu Ning, Qin Zheng and his friends were all in shock.After the shock, Zhang Yiming opened his mouth with intense dislike, \u201cMu Ke, why are you with her?\u201dThe \u201cher\u201d word had been stressed with discrimination.Hearing this, Mu Ke frowned with dissatisfaction in his eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business that I\u2019m with whom,\u201d Mu Ke replied unfriendly.Fu Mingliang immediately shouted in surprise, \u201cJesus, do you like Gu Ning? How is it possible? She\u2019s a poor girl. She can never be with you!\u201dApparently, Fu Mingliang also believed Mu Ke liked Gu Ning. To which, he didn\u2019t want to hide his dislike at all.\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d Mu Ke was annoyed. Gu Ning was his boss, and an extremely important figure in his heart. He couldn\u2019t tolerate someone else attack her before his face.Mu Ke looked coldly at Fu Mingliang. He was likely to fight, \u201cFu Mingliang, if you dare to say something like that, I\u2019ll beat you!\u201dMu Ke\u2019s behavior successfully irritated Fu Mingliang. He shouted angrily to Mu Ke, \u201cMu Ke, what is wrong with you? Do you really want to beat your bros for that girl?\u201dFu Mingliang\u2019s shout attracted people around them.\u201cInteresting,\u201d Mu Ke laughed in a sarcastic way, \u201cI honestly don\u2019t want to make friends with you. You\u2019re a bunch of bullies who enjoy humiliating an innocent classmate. You all rely on your parents to live a wealthy glorious life. And you\u2019re proud of it? Shame on you. Try to be independent sometimes!\u201dMu Ke had attacked them all, and raised dissatisfaction among them.Chen Ziyao opened her mouth first, because she still remembered that Gu Ning had slapped her face yesterday. She said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with us calling her a poor girl? She is a poor girl! And what\u2019s wrong with us relying on our parents? That\u2019s because we all have a wealthy and powerful family!\u201d\u201cExactly, she is born poor! That\u2019s pathetic!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao immediately followed.\u201cMu Ke, how about you then? You are running a jewelry store now. Didn\u2019t you ask your parents for money?\u201d Fu Mingliang was displeased, and he was jealous as well.Yes, he was being jealous.Although Fu Mingliang had no interest in a startup and he had no intention to work hard, he was still jealous of Mu Ke\u2019s profitable business.He didn\u2019t want Mu Ke to be better than him.Knowing this, Gu Ning was surprised. She didn\u2019t expect Mu Ke would start up a business at such a young age.A jewelry store, it seemed she had encountered her peer.\u201cSo what? At least my family only helped me with money, that\u2019s all.\u201d Mu Ke wasn\u2019t showing off. He was telling the truth.Gu Ning supported Mu Ke in her heart. She had to admit that Mu Ke was a boy of determination and ability.If it was possible, she even wanted to cooperate with him.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Fu Mingliang was still displease, but he knew the fact as well. All of a sudden, he couldn\u2019t argue back.Fu Mingliang gave up, while Gu Xiaoxiao continued, \u201cGee, Gu Ning, yesterday, you said you would be rich. Does it mean that you found yourself a rich boyfriend like Mu Ke?\u201d\u201cWell, Mu Ke indeed is from a rich family. However, you can never marry into such a rich family. Mu Ke will dump you sooner or later. Then, God bless you won\u2019t end up like your mother who was pregnant when she was just a freshman, and had been dumped by a man and dropped out of school. Now she.. Ah!\u201dBefore Gu Xiaoxiao could finish, she screamed out loud, which shocked everyone in the canteen.Especially those who were standing around her, they almost went deaf by the scream.Now, right on Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s head was an upside down plate. The food and oil were sliding down along her hair, face and clothes. Gu Xiaoxiao had egg on her face.At the same time, everyone was staring at Gu Ning in shock.They all saw clearly that Gu Ning had thrown the plate straight to Gu Xiaoxiao. The plate even had turned several circles in the air, then right fell on Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s head.Was this a coincidence? No, it couldn\u2019t be.Could Gu Ning do kung fu?Thinking of that, most people looked at Gu Ning in a different way, especially those who were kung fu lovers.\u201cWow, boss, you\u2019re so awesome. I want to learn this move!\u201d Mu Ke raised his voice with excitement. He admired Gu Ning now more than ever.Boss? The crowd was shocked once more.Mu Ke called Gu Ning his boss? What was going on?Gu Ning ignored Mu Ke, fixing her eyes on Gu Xiaoxiao with coldness. She warned, \u201cGu Xiaoxiao, shut your smelly mouth. If you dare to say another word to humiliate my mother, I\u2019ll beat you to the ground!\u201d\u201cWhat the f*ck! Gu Ning, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao wouldn\u2019t listen to Gu Ning\u2019s warning. She went crazy now, and ran to Gu Ning. The plate on her head fell down on the floor at the same time.Gu Ning sneered. She casually pulled a table nearby to her front.Then, Gu Xiaoxiao hit straight on the table.The crowd was shocked for the third time.The table was heavy. How could Gu Ning easily moved it?Now, everyone believed Gu Ning must be a master of kung fu.Gu Xiaoxiao was Qin Zheng\u2019s girlfriend. Seeing Gu Xiaoxiao had been treated so badly, he felt embarrassed as well. He had to stand up for Gu Xiaoxiao now. \u201cGu Ning, you\u2019re going too far!\u201d he criticized.Saying this, he instantly went to help Gu Xiaoxiao stand up.\u201cInteresting,\u201d Gu Ning sneered again. She looked at him in a meaningful way, \u201cReally? Compared with what you\u2019ve done to me, am I really going too far? If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m willing to tell the facts to everyone here, and let the crowd be the judge.\u201dGu Ning had no intention to continue actually. However, since those people wouldn\u2019t leave her alone, she decided to fight till the end.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qin Zheng was cornered. He absolutely knew what they had done to Gu Ning.What had they done to Gu Ning?Insiders all knew what Gu Ning was pointing to, but those outsiders were all curious about what had happened. The glances of curiosity moved around among Gu Ning, Gu Xiaoxiao and Qin Zheng.Mu Ke was an insider, while Yu Mixi knew half of the truth. Both of them were mad.\u201cLet bygones be bygones. You\u2019re fine now anyway.\u201d Qin Zheng was worried that Gu Ning would tell the truth.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Gu Ning felt like laughing. She argued him back with the same theory, \u201cIn that case, what has happened just then can also be forgiven, right?\u201dThen, Qin Zheng had no reason to blame her.Qin Zheng was dissatisfied, but wasn\u2019t able to argue back. Gu Xiaoxiao, on the contrary, felt aggrieved. It was impossible that she would forgive Gu Ning.\u201cGu Ning, you dare to throw the plate to me! You can never get away with it!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said with obvious hatred, throwing a plate on a table to Gu Ning directly.They stood so close. There was no way to stop it. Everyone was watching the plate flying to Gu Ning.Though Gu Ning had shown her ability just then, others were still worried that Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t be able to escape away from the plate, because the distance was so short.However, before everyone could see it clearly, bam, the plate was broken. All of them were amazed by the scene before them.Gu Ning even hit the plate, which was quickly flying to her, with a fist. The plate was hit broken afterwards, while Gu Ning\u2019s hand stayed the same.\u201cWow, holy awesome!\u201d Mu Ke looked at Gu Ning with admiration. He couldn\u2019t describe how much he admired Gu Ning now.Everyone acclaimed as well.\u201cYou, you\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was literally scared this time. She stepped backwards at once, staring at Gu Ning in horror, like she was looking at a beast.How come? How was it possible? Since when Gu Ning had become so powerful?\u201cGu Xiaoxiao, I\u2019ve warned you yesterday to stay away from me. You didn\u2019t listen. Since you won\u2019t leave me alone, I\u2019m willing to have a little fun,\u201d Gu Ning said coldly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao apparently was frightened by Gu Ning. She gave up for now, but still felt displeased. She said viciously, \u201cGu Ning, I\u2019m going to tell my dad and grandma that you\u2019ve bullied me. I\u2019ll let grandma kick you all out of the old house. I want you all to be homeless!\u201dGu Xiaoxiao was the center in her family. If she insisted, her grandma probably would follow her order.\u201cWe don\u2019t live in the old house for free. We pay the rent. We can live wherever we want after we leave the old house.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t care at all. She didn\u2019t plan to stay in there for much longer anyway.If they were going to move out of the old house today, she and Gu Man would stay in the hotel first. When she came back from City G, she would immediately buy a new house.\u201cBoss, you don\u2019t need to worry. I can help you find a house,\u201d Mu Ke supported Gu Ning.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was more than annoyed now. She clenched her teeth, and said, \u201cFine, very well, Gu Ning, let\u2019s go and see. You will regret!\u201dThen, she glared at Gu Ning, turning around and left. She even ignored Qin Zheng and other friends.Chen Ziyao was also displeased to see that Gu Ning had survived. She glared at Gu Ning too.Qin Zheng, Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang were all unhappy. They gave Gu Ning and Mu Ke a meaningful glance, then were gone as well.When they were all gone, the crowd dispersed gradually. Gu Ning and her friends felt disgusted at first, but then cheered up by eating.Gu Xiaoxiao immediately called her mother after she left. Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s mother, Lin Lijuan, was a pushy woman who cared about her own daughter only. Hearing her daughter had been bullied, Lin Lijuan was in a rage.Gu Xiaoxiao added fuel on flames. She told her mother that Gu Ning had picked up a rich boy, behaved immorally and so forth.Lin Lijuan hung up the phone. She instantly sent the driver to pick Gu Xiaoxiao up. Then she called Gu Man to humiliate and blame her for a long time.Lin Lijuan demand Gu Man that she should let Gu Ning apologize to Gu Xiaoxiao, or this would never end.Gu Man was shocked after hearing what had happened. Gu Ning had hit Gu Xiaoxiao by a plate, and even had slapped her? Gu Man found it was hard to believe, but since Lin Lijuan called her in person, it could be true.Gu Man, at the same time, assumed it wasn\u2019t as bad as what Lin Lijuan had said. Even though Gu Ning had beaten Gu Xiaoxiao, she must have done it because Gu Xiaoxiao had irritated her.Gu Man knew Gu Xiaoxiao so well. Gu Xiaoxiao had bullied Gu Ning for countless times ever since she was a little girl.Though Gu Man knew Gu Ning had been bullied, she didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.However, what had scared Gu Man more was that Lin Lijuan said Gu Ning had picked up a rich boy, and behaved immorally.She couldn\u2019t believe Gu Ning would do that, but teenagers were fall in love easily in adolescence. Gu Man was really concerned that Gu Ning would have done something wrong.The minute Gu Man hung up the call from Lin Lijuan, she called Gu Ning at once.When Gu Ning received Gu Man\u2019s call, they just arrived at the small forest.\u201cNingning, your eldest aunt just called me and said you\u2019ve hit Xiaoxiao by a plate. You even have slapped her? What has happened? Your eldest aunt also said you must apologize to Xiaoxiao, or this won\u2019t end,\u201d Gu Man worriedly inquired.Hearing this, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t surprised at all. She knew Gu Xiaoxiao would do this.\u201cI did throw a plate to her, but it didn\u2019t hit her. The plate was simply upside down on her head, and ruined her hair, face and clothes. That\u2019s all. I didn\u2019t beat her neither. She has humiliated me for many times. An upside down plate wasn\u2019t a serious punishment, to be honest,\u201d Gu Ning explained calmly. She didn\u2019t think she had done anything wrong.\u201cAnd the apologies, I did nothing wrong, so I won\u2019t apologize.\u201d Gu Ning refused to apologize without hesitation.Gu Man knew Lin Lijuan had exaggerated the facts. Now hearing Gu Ning\u2019s explanation, Gu Man believed she was right.Gu Man couldn\u2019t help feeling bad after she found out the reason why Gu Ning had thrown the plate out. She blamed herself for being useless, or her daughter wouldn\u2019t be bullied that often.A mother would protect her daughter naturally. Although Gu Man still thought Gu Ning have gone too far by throwing the plate, she believed Gu Ning had done nothing wrong.Thus she didn\u2019t force Gu Ning to apologize.\u201cNingning, you\u2019re going to attend the college entrance exam soon. You need to focus on your study, and don\u2019t fall in love at such a young age.\u201d Gu Man intended to ask Gu Ning whether she had picked up a rich boy, but she was afraid Gu Ning would felt hurt, so Gu Man didn\u2019t ask her directly.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Gu Ning was a smart girl. She knew the real intention of Gu Man. Gu Xiaoxiao must had bad-mouthed her behind her back.\u201cMom, I know Gu Xiaoxiao must have told my eldest aunt something bad about me, but Mom, you need to trust me. I\u2019m not the kind of girl who doesn\u2019t have sense of self-esteem.\u201d\u201cGreat, I trust you.\u201d Though Gu Man was still concerned, she chose to believe Gu Ning.After a while, Gu Ning hung up. They went into a remote part of the small forest, in case others would see them.Training of kung fu was a long-term practice. Although Mu Ke had learned several moves, he needed to practice often. Thus Mu Ke and Gu Ning continued to train the way they had done yesterday.As for Mixi, because she wasn\u2019t physically strong enough now, she couldn\u2019t directly fight with Gu Ning to train in practice. Gu Ning let her do horse stance first.When Gu Ning and her friends were focused on training, a post about her raised a fierce discussion in their school forum. Someone had taken a video of what had just happened in the canteen and uploaded it onto the forum.\u201cGee, this can\u2019t be real! The plate has been perfectly thrown ahead.\u201d\u201cAnd the table is too heavy to move. How can she easily pull it!\u201d\u201cThe plate as well. How can she hit it broken at once!\u201d\u201cAn ordinary person can never do that. I believe this female student must be a master of kung fu.\u201d\u201cA master of kung fu? I don\u2019t believe you. You must have read too many action novels, but I have to say this female student is quiet somebody!\u201d\u201cOh my! I\u2019ve met this female student before, in the small forest yesterday. She was fighting with another tall strong male student. The boy has been beaten down on the ground. I wanted to take a video of them, but the female student has discovered and threatened me away.\u201d\u201cPlease, tell us what did she say?\u201d\u201cPlease, please, I\u2019m waiting online.\u201d\u201cPlease, please, please.\u201d\u201cShe said, \u2018Do you want to fight with me?\u2019 F*ck, I would never risk my life for that, and I ran away in horror.\u201dEveryone laughed and teased.There were both complementary and acid comments.\u201cI think she just wants to gain attention.\u201d\u201cExactly, people nowadays are eager to be famous.\u201d\u201cI agree. If she really do kung fu, she can have a fight with Chu Peihan, and prove to us!\u201d\u2026Seeing those acid remarks, those who admired Gu Ning were displeased. They immediately retorted.\u201cAre you blind? Try throwing a plate and see if it turns and aims at the target by yourself. And pull the table to move if you can!\u201d\u201cExactly, shut your mouth if you can\u2019t do it yourself.\u201d\u201cI think they are being jealous. They just can\u2019t stand the fact that Gu Ning is better than them.\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t agree more. Some girls are so jealous of others. Bros, we need to be clear-sighted, and stay away from those girls to protect ourselves.\u201d\u201cSure! I prefer to stay single forever rather than be with a pretentious bitch.\u201d\u201cAgree.\u201d\u2026\u201cAgree.\u201dThose boys were so evil. They soon conquered the group of girls who had bad-mouthed Gu Ning, but secretly guided those girls\u2019 anger to Gu Ning.Right at that moment, a comment attracted everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cIs she really that powerful? I\u2019m Hao Ran, a senior from the seventh classroom. I now challenge this female student to have a fight with me. Anyone who knows this female student, tell me about her.\u201dImmediately, the discussion became fiercer.Hao Ran, the senior student from the seventh classroom, was a well-known figure in their school, but he was notorious for his bad behaviors.He had involved himself in fights and riots, behaving even worse than Chu Peihan. If he hadn\u2019t had a powerful background as well, he would have been expelled from the school too.Now, Gu Ning was in trouble.Those who had criticized Gu Ning just then instantly added fuel to the fire.Before long, Gu Ning\u2019s information was leaked.Whoever had leaked Gu Ning\u2019s information must hate her very much, and wanted to see her in danger.After Hao Ran had challenged Gu Ning, some felt worried, some looked forward to it, and some just enjoyed building their happiness on others\u2019 suffering.There were many students gathered outside the door of the fourth classroom. Soon, Qin Zheng, Zhang Yiming, Fu Mingliang and Chen Ziyao were included. They all came for Gu Ning. To be exact, they were here for Hao Ran and Gu Ning.Among those onlookers, Qin Zheng and his friends along with Shao Feifei and her friends were most excited to see what would happen next.If Gu Xiaoxiao had known the news, she must feel regret going home so early and missing the drama.In the passage, three boys who were leaning against the guardrails were most noticeable. They weren\u2019t good-looking actually, but because no one dared to stay closer to them, they were noticeable then.Although the three boys weren\u2019t handsome, they weren\u2019t ugly at all. They behaved in an arrogant and aggressive way, which showed they were bad boys.\u201cHao Ran, Gu Ning probably is too afraid to come,\u201d a boy who was standing at the right among those three male students opened his mouth.There were only a few minutes away from the evening class. Gu Ning was still absent. Probably she was frightened.\u201cShe can\u2019t hide forever, unless she drops out of school,\u201d the boy in the middle, who was Hao Ran, said with disdain.\u201cShall we wait any longer? The evening class is about to begin in a few minutes,\u201d a boy who was standing at the left asked.\u201cYes, why not? Probably she intends to come until we\u2019re gone when the evening class is about to begin,\u201d Hao Ran said.The minute Gu Ning and her friends went out of the stairs, they saw many people around outside of fourth classroom.Something must had happened.No matter what had happened, the evening class was about to begin, and Gu Ning together with Yu Mixi had to walk through.Mu Ke\u2019s classroom wasn\u2019t in the same direction of Gu Ning\u2019s, but out of curiosity, he followed Gu Ning walking ahead.Someone immediately found Gu Ning was coming.Chen Ziyao opened her mouth at once, \u201cGee! Isn\u2019t this Gu Ning? Who said she\u2019s scared? She\u2019s quite awesome!\u201dChen Ziyao did it on purpose to push Gu Ning into the center of trouble. The more she complimented Gu Ning, the unhappier Hao Ran would be.When Gu Ning showed up, Chen Ziyao directly opened her phone, starting to shoot. She wanted to send the video to Gu Xiaoxiao after it was over.Hearing that, Gu Ning knew they weren\u2019t kind people. However, Gu Ning assumed Chen Ziyao and her friends were those who came here to cause her trouble.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35\u201cYou\u2019re Gu Ning, right?\u201d Hao Ran walked to Gu Ning and asked with certainty.\u201cYes. What\u2019s up?\u201d Gu Ning answered calmly with confidence. She wasn\u2019t afraid at all.\u201cHao Ran, what do you want to do?\u201d Seeing Hao Ran being here, Mu Ke, who followed Gu Ning, felt something must be wrong. He immediately stepped forward to protect Gu Ning.He had no idea why Hao Ran was here for Gu Ning, but he did know Hao Ran was here not because of Chen Ziyao.Hao Ran was surprised that Mu Ke would protect Gu Ning, but he still continued, \u201cI saw the video about what had happened in the canteen on our school\u2019s forum. Everyone says Gu Ning is powerful. I disagree though. Thus, I\u2019m here to challenge Gu Ning to have a fight with me. Does she dare to accept my challenge?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHearing that, Mu Ke and Yu Mixi was shocked. They all looked at Gu Ning with worry at once. Gu Ning, instead, remained calm. The boy was here to challenge her! Gu Ning even assumed he was here because of Chen Ziyao.Mu Ke quietly swore at the person who had uploaded the video. The person apparently wanted to cause Gu Ning trouble! Gu Ning was displeased as well, but she was more interested than terrified in Hao Ran\u2019s challenge.Gu Ning was very familiar with Hao Ran\u2019s name, because Hao Ran was as notorious as Chu Peihan in their school. He was often involved in fights and riots, and always absent in classes. Hao Ran had received as many punishments as Chu Peihan.But, he couldn\u2019t have a high score like Chu Peihan. He was terrible at studying.Hao Ran was from a super rich family. His family was the third richest family with dozens of millions of assets in City F.Hao Ran, Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping, the three of them was a famous gang in their school.Gu Ning had also heard something about Qin Zixun\u2019s and Zhang Tianping\u2019s background. Qin Zixun was a son of the authorities, but Gu Ning didn\u2019t know his father\u2019s position. As for Zhang Tianping, it was said that he was an orphan. Those three boys had become good friends in a fight.Though they had very different background, they were truly intimate friends.Gu Ning had plan in her mind after she found out who those boys were.\u201cHao Ran, how can you even beat a girl.\u201d Mu Ke was extremely annoyed. Though he believed Gu Ning\u2019s ability, these three boys weren\u2019t easy to handle.\u201cIf she were an ordinary girl, it may look like I\u2019m beating her, but since she does kung fu, we can learn from each other,\u201d Hao Ran didn\u2019t think there was anything wrong with that.Yes, if Gu Ning had been a common girl, he would never beat her, but the video had proved that she wasn\u2019t weak at all.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mu Ke was mad. Before he could continue, Gu Ning interrupted.\u201cWhat if I win, and what if I lose?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cIf you can win, I can do a thing for you, but if I win, you must do a thing for us. Relax, I won\u2019t let you do something immoral,\u201d Hao Ran replied.Hao Ran was a boy with principles.\u201cSure, challenge accepted, but I want more than just a thing,\u201d Gu Ning said.The crowd was amazed by the result that Gu Ning accepted the challenge and even wanted to add chips.Although everyone believed Gu Ning was quite someone in the video, Hao Ran was well-known for his outstanding ability in a fight. No one thought Gu Ning would win.Was Gu Ning being confident, or was she thinking too highly of herself?\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d Mu Ke called her with worry, but Gu Ning stopped him by a glance.\u201cTell me what do you want?\u201d Hao Ran was surprised Gu Ning would accept his challenge without hesitation. He now was more curious than surprised about Gu Ning\u2019s condition.He didn\u2019t know whether Gu Ning was being confident or arrogant, but he appreciated her attitude.\u201cOne vs. three, if I lose, I\u2019ll do three things for you, but if I win, three of you must call me boss, and be loyal to me afterwards till the entrance exam is over,\u201d Gu Ning said airily while others were all in shock.What? One vs. three? The losers must call her boss?Gu Ning was so confident!After the shock, Hao Ran and his friends were irritated by Gu Ning\u2019s words. It was a humiliation to them. How could he call a girl boss!\u201cYou want to be our boss? Interesting,\u201d Hao Ran sneered.\u201cExactly, what the hell are you?\u201d\u201cGu Ning, being confident is good, but don\u2019t be too over.\u201dQin Zixun and Zhang Tianping added in anger.\u201cI know who I am. Whether I\u2019m being confident or arrogant, it\u2019s none of your business. At least, I\u2019m not afraid. If you\u2019re cowards and don\u2019t dare to accept the challenge, then you lose!\u201d Gu Ning glanced through Hao Ran and his friends with obvious provocation.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHao Ran and his friends felt shamed after that. Their dignity didn\u2019t allow them to be hesitated.\u201cCowards? We\u2019ve never ever been cowards. Challenge accepted!\u201d Hao Ran answered with anger.Hao Ran was always the decision-maker among them. Since Hao Ran accepted, the other two all agreed. Besides, they didn\u2019t want to be cowards neither!\u201cVery well. Then I\u2019ll see you at 1 pm tomorrow in the small forest.\u201d Gu Ning said with satisfaction, which made Mu Ke feel that she had everything in control.Well, he should believe in Gu Ning. Since Gu Ning was willing to accept the challenge, she must be confident to win.After what had happened during the past days, Yu Mixi knew Gu Ning would never change her mind once she had made her decision. Yu Mixi also remained quiet. She only needed to believe her friend.Then, Gu Ning directly turned around, and went inside her classroom, leaving everyone behind.Hao Ran and his friends snorted, then were gone as well.The crowd dispersed afterwards since the major roles had all gone.There was a glance of viciousness in Chen Ziyao\u2019s eyes when she watched Gu Ning walking away. She felt disappointed when Gu Ning stayed calm. Thus she hoped more that Gu Ning would lose tomorrow. The worse, the better.Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang had the same thought, while Qin Zheng\u2019s feelings were complicated. He wanted to see Gu Ning learn her lesson, but he also felt concerned for her.When Gu Ning entered the classroom, her classmates looked at her with worry, anticipation, but more with unkindness, especially Shao Feifei and her friends.Shao Feifei wanted to mock her, but the bell rang. Thus she had to close her mouth.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36\u201cGu Ning, come out here for a moment.\u201dThe head teacher asked Gu Ning to come out the minute she arrived. Gu Ning knew it must be because of what had happened tonight.The minute Gu Ning walked out of the classroom, the head teacher asked her in anger, \u201cWhy did you do that in the canteen? Why did you hit another schoolmate? And why did you accept the challenge of Hao Ran, Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping, who\u2019re from the seventh classroom? Do you know this is a big deal now, which has a bad impact on both you and our class?\u201dFacing the head teacher\u2019s questions and anger, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t mad at all. She explained with patience instead, \u201cProfessor Zhang, it was because Gu Xiaoxiao has humiliated me and my mother first, then I hit her in the canteen. How can I be able to tolerate the humiliation like that? As for Hao Ran and his friends, they will never leave me alone if I didn\u2019t accept the challenge. I would rather face the trouble at the very beginning.\u201dZhang Qiuhua actually knew Gu Ning\u2019s condition. She knew other students always bullied Gu Ning. However, since nothing severe had happened, she ignored all of them.It was understandable that Gu Ning would fight back.Though she believed it had been too over, Gu Ning had made the right choice for herself. Zhang Qiuhua didn\u2019t know what to say.But, she still couldn\u2019t accept the fact that Gu Ning had accepted the challenge of Hao Ran. \u201cGu Ning, can you, a girl win over the three boys? Besides, the school won\u2019t allow students to fight. You\u2019ll be punished for that, and our class also will be criticized,\u201d Zhang Qiuhua said.Hearing that, Gu Ning was a little shocked. She totally forgot she would be punished for fighting, and her class would also be criticized for her behavior.\u201cBut I\u2019ve promised them already. If I regret, Hao Ran will revenge on me.\u201d Gu Ning felt she had been cornered.\u201cYou, my blood is boiling now.\u201d Gu Ning really pissed Zhang Qiuhua off. Although Gu Ning was the reason of all these troubles, Hao Ran was the major cause, Zhang Qiuhua couldn\u2019t blame Gu Ning for all.She also wasn\u2019t that cold-blooded to see Gu Ning revenged by Hao Ran only because Gu Ning regretted.If Hao Ran was going to take revenge on Gu Ning, even the school couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201cHow about this? I can go have the fight with Hao Ran outside the school, then no one will be punished,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhang Qiuhua was still displeased. \u201cGu Ning, how could you be so dumb! How can you be so sure that you can win Hao Ran and his friends? What if you\u2019re hurt, and your mother will be worried? Can your family afford the medical treatment?\u201dZhang Qiuhua had told the plain truth. She had no intention to insult Gu Ning, but it\u2019s for Gu Ning\u2019s good.Gu Ning understood her teacher cared about her, so she wasn\u2019t annoyed. Gu Ning replied with pure confidence, \u201cPlease don\u2019t worry about that. I am going to win them, really.\u201dIt was hard for Zhang Qiuhua to believe, but she knew it was meaningless to continue this topic, so she said, \u201cGood luck.\u201dAfter that Zhang Qiuhua stopped talking to Gu Ning, and left in anger.Gu Ning shrugged her shoulders resignedly and went back to her classroom.Although everyone in the classroom was all ears to listen to Zhang Qiuhua criticizing Gu Ning, Zhang Qiuhua kept her voice low and no one actually heard anything. They only saw Zhang Qiuhua leave in anger.Gu Ning, instead, was super calm from the very beginning to the end, and wasn\u2019t sad or scared of being criticized at all. Everyone was puzzled.When Gu Ning walked inside, most of the students focused on her face wanting to figure out what had happened.Because the head teacher was gone, the classroom wasn\u2019t that quiet any longer. It wasn\u2019t one of the top classes, thus those students didn\u2019t enjoy studying very much.\u201cHey, Gu Ning, are you sure you\u2019re going to win them?\u201d A male student sat in front of Gu Ning turning back to ask her in doubt.\u201cExactly! one vs. three, that\u2019s really something!\u201d Another male student added with admiration.\u201cYou have the great gesture. Do you have the same great ability?\u201d Someone poured cold water on Gu Ning.\u201cExactly, I\u2019m not positive about that,\u201d another one agreed.\u2026Most of the students didn\u2019t believe Gu Ning would succeed. Gu Ning ignored them, but Yu Mixi couldn\u2019t stay quiet any more. She retorted for the first time, \u201cI believe in Gu Ning. I think she\u2019ll win.\u201dGu Ning smiled a little. Yu Mixi made her progress.\u201cSo what? You believe in her doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019ll win,\u201d a classmate argued.\u201cExactly, I don\u2019t believe,\u201d someone said.\u201cWe\u2019ll all find out tomorrow noon. It\u2019s too early to deny Gu Ning\u2019s ability now! Let\u2019s wait and see!\u201d Yu Mixi argued.Those who weren\u2019t positive turned quiet gradually. Some still wanted to pour cold water, but the head teacher returned. They had to close their mouth.In the house of the Gu family, a room was decorated in a dreamy way like it was a princess\u2019s room. Gu Xiaoxiao was in a pink nightgown, lying on a big pink bed with a phone in her hands. She was watching the video sent by Chen Ziyao, and felt it was a pity that she hadn\u2019t been there herself.Gu Xiaoxiao had the same reaction as Chen Ziyao. She felt extremely unhappy about Gu Ning\u2019s confidence, and didn\u2019t believe Gu Ning could win Hao Ran and his friends. She was gloating now.She couldn\u2019t wait to see Gu Ning beaten down on the ground tomorrow noon.Moreover, she was waiting for the apologies from Gu Ning. Gu Xiaoxiao decided to spare no effort to pick on Gu Ning. If Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t apologize, or she wasn\u2019t satisfied, she would persuade her grandma to kick Gu Ning and her mother out of the old house.The next morning, Gu Xiaoxiao waited at the stairs for Gu Ning. She wanted to seize the chance to make fun of Gu Ning. After a long time, Gu Ning was still absent. Gu Xiaoxiao was losing her patience.\u201cThe morning class is about to begin. Is Gu Ning terrified to come to school today?\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao assumed.\u201cWho knows!\u201d Chen Ziyao was sure.It was two minutes away from the morning class, Gu Ning appeared with Mu Ke and Yu Mixi.Seeing Mu Ke, Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao was more jealous of Gu Ning now. Mu Ke had been their friend before, but now he chose Gu Ning over them.Besides, Mu Ke was from a better family than them. They wanted to cooperate with Mu Ke. Unexpectedly, Mu Ke would stand up for Gu Ning against them.Mu Ke and Yu Mixi felt unpleasant when they noticed Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao were here. Gu Ning stayed calm as usual.\u201cGu Ning, I\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re going to fight with those three boys this noon. One vs. three even. You\u2019re bold and confident enough to do so, but are you really being confident, or you\u2019re simply arrogant?\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said unkindly.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37\u201cI\u2019m always confident.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to hide her confidence.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao hated Gu Ning most when she stayed so calm before the storm came. Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to tear Gu Ning apart, \u201cGu Ning, keep pretending! I\u2019ll go and see how you become a loser right before my eyes! And if you don\u2019t apologize for what you\u2019ve done yesterday, you\u2019ll pay for it! \u201dGu Xiaoxiao clenched her teeth out of anger and hatred.\u201cI will never apologize. Do whatever you want to. I\u2019m waiting,\u201d Gu Ning replied airily. Then she ignored Gu Xiaoxiao, throwing her a provocative look, and walked away.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was mad. She didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning would dare to do that. She shouted at Gu Ning back, \u201cGreat, Gu Ning, you\u2019ll regret!\u201d\u201cGu Ning, is it really going to be alright?\u201d Yu Mixi asked in worry. She was concerned Gu Ning and her mother would be homeless.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It\u2019s fine,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Gradually, Yu Mixi had pure trust in Gu Ning. Since Gu Ning had said it would be fine, she would not doubt it.Mu Ke gave Gu Xiaoxiao and Chen Ziyao a cold glance, then went back to his classroom.Some students still believed Gu Ning would not come to school today. When Gu Ning showed up, they were all surprised.Wasn\u2019t Gu Ning afraid at all?In the morning, Gu Ning had received many curious looks from others, their head teacher included. They all wanted to see fear from Gu Ning\u2019s face, but failed. Gu Ning was at ease, like nothing had happened.When the last class in the morning was about to over, the head teacher couldn\u2019t help asking Gu Ning, \u201cAre you really that confident?\u201d\u201cI never do anything without being fully-prepared,\u201d Gu Ning answered with solemnity.The head teacher had nothing else to say. She left in quietness.The appointed time was 1 pm. Gu Ning decided to eat first after the classes were over.When Gu Ning and her friends went upstairs, Hao Ran and his friends stopped them. They actually didn\u2019t mean to limit Gu Ning\u2019s freedom. They simply followed Gu Ning in case she would run away.Gu Ning felt resigned. Could anyone has any trust on her?\u201cDo you plan to buy me, your boss, a meal first?\u201d Gu Ning looked at them, joking.\u201cGu Ning, don\u2019t be so confident. It\u2019s too early to say that,\u201d Hao Ran retorted. Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping glared at Gu Ning at the same time.Actually, those three boys weren\u2019t aggressive normally. However, whenever they encountered Gu Ning, they were easily irritated.Probably because Gu Ning was being too calm, which made them feel like they hadn\u2019t been taken seriously.Or probably because Gu Ning\u2019s calmness showed her confidence, which made them feel nervous unconsciously. Therefore, they would fight against her confidence by arguing.\u201cAren\u2019t you confident?\u201d Gu Ning asked them.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hao Ran and his friends suddenly realized Gu Ning had outstanding ability to piss someone off.Everyone around them started to discuss.\u201cGu Ning isn\u2019t scared at all! She\u2019s even in the mood of joking.\u201dGu Xiaoxiao, Shao Feifei and their friends all wanted Gu Ning to fail. Seeing Gu Ning being so confident, they were greatly displeased.\u201cI think she\u2019s pretending!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said.\u201cExactly, she\u2019s merely pretended to be relaxed.\u201d\u2026Shao Feifei wanted to mock at Gu Ning, but she restricted herself for Mu Ke was here.However, Mu Ke never glanced at her from the very beginning to the end. Shao Feifei was disappointed. She wanted to talk to him, but Gu Ning and Yu Mixi were here as well.\u201cSince you\u2019re already here, why not\u2026\u201d Gu Ning proposed.\u201cWhat?\u201d Hao Ran and his friends asked with one accord.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be punished for fighting inside the school, thus we\u2019ll fight outside. Since we all haven\u2019t had meal yet, why don\u2019t we have the fight first, and the loser will buy the meal. Plus the precious condition stays the same,\u201d Gu Ning said in a provocative way.\u201cVery well,\u201d Hao Ran and his friends agreed.\u201cThere\u2019s a newly-demolished ruin at the opposite side of the back door of our school. There are few people around. Let\u2019s go there!\u201d Then, Gu Ning moved first, followed by Mu Ke and Yu Mixi. Hao Ran and his friends were behind.The onlookers wouldn\u2019t miss that. All of the 40 students in the fourth classroom were here, along with Gu Xiaoxiao and her friends and dozens of students from other classrooms.A group of people moved outside attracted much attention.It wasn\u2019t usual to see such a large gathering of students in the school. Many people immediately knew there was going to be a fight.Those cowards all stayed away, while those who wanted to see a drama followed up. Accordingly, a group of dozens of students became a group of hundreds. The security guards of the school also noticed that.But unless someone got hurt, they wouldn\u2019t do anything about it.Gu Ning and others went straight to the ruin.Everyone was excited when they arrived at the ruin, pulling out a phone, preparing to shoot.Although Mu Ke and Yu Mixi chose to believe in Gu Ning, they felt anxious. They didn\u2019t want her to be injured.\u201cBoss, fighting!\u201d\u201cGu Ning, fighting!\u201dWhen Mu Ke and Yu Mixi tried to encourage Gu Ning, their voices were trembling a little.\u201cJust trust me,\u201d Gu Ning comforted them. Her determined voice calmed Mu Ke and Yu Mixi down a lot.\u201cShall we stop when it\u2019s necessary, or shall we fight to the end?\u201d Before they started, Gu Ning asked.\u201cAs long as someone fall on the ground, he or she loses.\u201d Hao Ran didn\u2019t want to go too far, given that Gu Ning was a girl.Gu Ning had a great impression of Hao Ran\u2019s behavior, but she also knew they still didn\u2019t take her seriously enough.If one didn\u2019t take his opponent seriously, he would lose in any kind of fight.\u201cGreat, then, let\u2019s begin!\u201dGu Ning announced the beginning, and both sides moved.Gu Ning moved extremely fast. Before everyone could see it clearly, Gu Ning came straight to Zhang Tianping\u2019s face. She threw Zhang Tianping over her shoulder without hesitation.Zhang Tianping, who was a tall strong boy, was easily thrown over by Gu Ning\u2019s shoulder to the ground. Everyone was in a shock.Zhang Tianping himself was struck dumb too. He still had no idea what had happened when he was thrown to the floor.Obviously, Gu Ning had seized her chance when Zhang Tianping didn\u2019t take her seriously.Those boys were real fighter actually. If they were fully-prepared, it would cost Gu Ning more time to deal with them.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Hao Ran and Qin Zixun was totally amazed, but they got their mind back soon. They were astonished in their heart, but never hesitated to move. If they hadn\u2019t taken Gu Ning seriously before, now they wouldn\u2019t do the same thing.Facing Qin Zixun\u2019s fist, Gu Ning raised hers to his, but when their fists were about to meet each other, Gu Ning suddenly kicked on Qin Zixun\u2019s stomach.Qin Zixun stepped backwards at short notice, like he had been hit by a heavy object.Luckily, he was strong enough and didn\u2019t fall.The crowd was shocked again. Some instantly raised their anticipation of Gu Ning.Those who wanted to see Gu Ning lose were all disappointed now.Hao Ran tried to get Gu Ning down on the ground by attaching her legs with his.Since now Gu Ning stood on the floor with one leg, everyone thought she was going to lose this time.Even Mu Ke and Yu Mixi took a long breath in.Unexpectedly, Gu Ning brought her another leg back at once, then kicked out at Hao Ran\u2019s leg. Hao Ran was unable to stand steadily afterwards.Of course, Gu Ning stepped backwards for a short distance as well.Right at that moment, Qin Zixun attacked Gu Ning with his fist.Gu Ning didn\u2019t escape at all though. She reached out her hand, directly holding Qin Zixun\u2019s fist in her palm.Gu Ning was still a teenage girl. Her hand didn\u2019t fully cover Qin Zixun\u2019s fist, but she was powerful enough to stop Qin Zixun from moving at all.Qin Zixun didn\u2019t panic. He immediately used another hand to hit Gu Ning, but his fist was held by her palm once more.Then, before Qin Zixun would able to attack her again, Gu Ning raised her foot and aimed at his shin. Qin Zixun lost his balance, falling heavily on the ground.The crowd rounded their eyes in shock again.Within three moves, only three moves, Qin Zixun was down on the ground.Qin Zixun, the boy who normally could fight again around seven people, now was defeated by Gu Ning within three moves. It was hard for anyone of the crowd to accept the fact.At last, only Hao Ran was standing straight.Actually, Hao Ran knew he was going to lose at that moment, but he wouldn\u2019t give up without fighting. Thus, he must be more violent than usual.After several rounds, when Hao Ran wasn\u2019t able to stand steadily, Gu Ning kicked him right away.But she was caught by him at an important point.The crowd thought Hao Ran was going to win this time. However, Gu Ning used her another foot to grab the ground tightly, turning her body afterwards. Her foot got rid of Hao Ran\u2019s hand at once.Then, Gu Ning continued to kick.Now, it was too late for Hao Ran to defend himself. He was kicked accurately and fell down.He lost.The best fighter Hao Ran lost the fight within 10 moves. Everyone was more than shocked.They lost, really. Hao Ran and his another two bros vs. Gu Ning, and the boys lost. Gu Ning had won the game easily too. Nobody would believe what they had just witnessed.Even Mu Ke and Yu Mixi, who believed in Gu Ning, was completely amazed.\u201cJesus! Did I see it wrong? Gu Ning, she won!\u201d\u201cI think we must be in a dream. Gu Ning won the game?\u201d\u201cExactly! I can\u2019t believe my eyes. It\u2019s so unreal!\u201d\u201cBut the truth is not only has Gu Ning won, she also won it so easily. She looked so cool when she was attacking them.\u201d\u201cYes! Especially the flip, it was so cool!\u201d\u201cI truly believe Gu Ning is a real master now!\u201d\u2026For now, no one would question whether Gu Ning was a master of kung fu any more. In ordinary people\u2019s eyes, she was.Hao Ran and his friends were still in shock, but they were more qualified than anyone else to admit the truth, because they had been through the whole progress.While Shao Feifei, Gu Xiaoxiao and their friends were totally unwilling to accept the fact.Shao Feifei even blurted out, \u201cNo, no, no. It\u2019s impossible. Hao Ran and his friends must haven\u2019t done it with full strength.\u201dEven though there were some students who had the same thought, no one dared to say it out. It was a humiliation to Hao Ran and his friends. No one wanted to have bad blood with them.Hao Ran and his friends had lost the fight, which was humiliating enough. Shao Feifei\u2019s words had added fuel on the flames. They were in a rage at once.\u201cShut your bloody mouth up! Don\u2019t think that I\u2019m not one to punch women!\u201d Hao Ran shouted at Shao Feifei in great anger like he was about to beat her. Shao Feifei immediately shut her mouth, holding her breath in horror.She looked to Mu Ke, searching for sympathy and comfort. Unfortunately, Mu Ke glared at her, apparently because she had questioned Gu Ning.Right now, Shao Feifei felt deeply hurt and aggrieved. She started to cry.Shao Feifei wasn\u2019t smart actually. Since she liked Mu Ke, she should never pick on someone he cherished, but she did otherwise.It would only make Mu Ke hate her if she picked on Gu Ning.Hao Ran\u2019s shout shut Shao Feifei and many others\u2019 mouth, Gu Xiaoxiao and her friends were included.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t expect it would end so soon. We even came outside the school for it. If it had been for fear of punishment, I don\u2019t think we need to waste the time,\u201d Gu Ning said, like they had made a mountain out of a molehill.Hearing this, everyone was speechless. Who could know this would end so easily!At the same time, Hao Ran and his friends felt so embarrassed that they even wanted to hide into a crack on the ground.Gu Ning was really powerful!Hao Ran took a deep breath, looking at Gu Ning. Although he felt ashamed after he had lost the fight, he admired Gu Ning after all.Thus, he admitted without further ado.\u201cWe lost the game, and you\u2019re our boss from now on,\u201d Hao Ran said with sincerity.\u201cYes, you\u2019re our boss from now on,\u201d Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping followed.\u201cVery well,\u201d Gu Ning answered. She suddenly said then, \u201cI\u2019m hungry, let\u2019s go eat first! Since I\u2019m the winner, I\u2019ll make the decision of the food.\u201dGu Ning gave Mu Ke and Yu Mixi a hint to follow her up, then she left in a hurry.Gu Ning wasn\u2019t hungry actually. She just didn\u2019t want to be stared at by a group of people any longer.Since Hao Ran and his friends had already accepted Gu Ning as their boss, they would follow her order, and they never lacked of money.Seeing Gu Ning walking away, Shao Feifei, Gu Xiaoxiao and their friends\u2019 eyes were all full of disappointment and deep hatred.Why? Why did Gu Ning suddenly become so powerful?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Chen Ziyao, Zhang Yiming and Fu Mingliang felt disappointed too. At the same time, they were also terrified. Gu Ning wasn\u2019t only powerful now. She also had the support of Hao Ran and his friends. What if she revenged on them for what they had done to her?Thinking of this, they all felt concerned.Qin Zheng\u2019s feelings, meanwhile, ran the gamut of emotions. He slightly regretted breaking up with Gu Ning, because the girl was so impressive now.But thinking further, he calmed down. No matter how impressive Gu Ning was, she was still a poor girl, who would not help him for anything, and probably would embarrass him.On the way while leaving, Gu Xiaoxiao pulled out her phone and sent Gu Man a message. It was a message with photos of Gu Ning in a fight with others.Visually, Gu Ning seemed to be hit by the boys.Gu Man was walking downstairs after she had finished her meal in the canteen. She heard the ringtone, then took out the phone to check. Though she used a cheap old phone, it still could receive photos.When Gu Man saw the photos on her phone, she was scared and fell down from the stairs by accident. Her head hit the ground even.On the other side, Hao Ran and his friends called Gu Ning their boss all the time after they left the crowd. They complimented Gu Ning the same way Mu Ke had done before.\u201cBoss, since we all listen to you now, can you teach us kung fu? We want to be helpful in the future!\u201d\u201cExactly, boss, you\u2019re so awesome. Normally, each of us can fight against seven or eight men, but all of us together can\u2019t win you. You won the fight so easily.\u201d\u201cBoss\u2026\u201dHao Ran and his friends wouldn\u2019t stop talking. Gu Ning felt noisy, but not displeased.Seeing Hao Ran and his friends now were like obedient dogs, Mu Ke and Yu Mixi felt so proud.However, Mu Ke was still annoyed that they had disrespected Gu Ning before.\u201cWell, how come someone who was so arrogant, now is like an obedient dog?\u201d Mu Ke said deliberately.Hearing that, Hao Ran and his friends were embarrassed. They knew Mu Ke was unhappy about their previous attitude towards Gu Ning, thus they didn\u2019t blame Mu Ke for his words.Hao Ran walked to Mu Ke, placing his hand on Mu Ke\u2019s shoulder, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t fight, we won\u2019t get to know each other. Let the bygones be the bygones. We\u2019re bros from now on. If you have any need and want my help in the future, just tell me!\u201d\u201cYeah! Yeah!\u201d Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping agreed.Mu Ke wasn\u2019t really mad at them actually. He also understood they were friends now, since they had taken Gu Ning as their boss.They even had changed their attitude. Mu Ke thought there was no need to hate them any longer.\u201cMixi is a child without much strength. We need to take care of her,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSure, no problem,\u201d everyone immediately agreed.Yu Mixi was a little shy, but she accepted.Gu Ning didn\u2019t plan to eat an expensive meal. She simply wanted to have hot pot.But when they just walked to the restaurant, Gu Ning\u2019s phone rang.Both Yu Mixi and Mu Ke were slightly surprised when Gu Ning took out her phone.They knew Gu Ning\u2019s family was poor. She had used a cheap old phone before, but now she used a brand new one, which seemed expensive.Hao Ran and his friends didn\u2019t know Gu Ning was from a poor family. They didn\u2019t find anything wrong.The caller was Gu Man. Gu Ning answered it at once.Her face changed suddenly when she heard the voice from the other side. Gu Ning said she would come soon, then hung up.\u201cBoss, what\u2019s up?\u201d Everyone noticed Gu Ning\u2019s change, and knew something bad must have happened. They all asked in worry.\u201cMy mother fell from the stairs and now is in unconsciousness. She was sent to the hospital. I need to visit her right now. You can have the meal without me.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t hide the fact. She ran to take a taxi to the hospital afterwards.\u201cBoss\u2026\u201d Before the rest could realize, Gu Ning was already gone.\u201cLet\u2019s go and visit as well,\u201d Mu Ke said. He ran ahead immediately. Hao Ran and the others all followed up without hesitation.Their boss\u2019s mother was in danger. They couldn\u2019t step aside!At that moment, a black Maserati moved over at a very high speed. There were two men sitting inside.Leng Shaoting sat on the passenger\u2019s seat. He frowned a little. He was losing his patience, because the one who was sitting on the driver\u2019s seat wouldn\u2019t stop talking, but he didn\u2019t interrupt.\u201cShaoting, leave it to our fourth bro! You\u2019re not fully recovered yet. What if you get injured again! Do take care of yourself!\u201d The man on the driver\u2019s seat complained for Leng Shaoting\u2019s good.The man on the driver\u2019s seat was the one who had helped Leng Shaoting destroy the tapes the other day.He was in a white casual suit as usual, looking handsome, decent and charming.He didn\u2019t care Leng Shaoting ignored him, continuing to talk, \u201cWhy do you have to get yourself involved in so much business? You even don\u2019t want to have a vacation. I don\u2019t think any girl will like you if you continue to do that.\u201dFrom afar, Leng Shaoting\u2019s sight fell on a girl in a school uniform on the sidewalk. The girl seemed worried and was in a hurry to take a taxi.At the first glance, Leng Shaoting felt familiar with the girl\u2019s figure.After they approached near, Leng Shaoting recognized her. He immediately said, \u201cStop.\u201dThe man who was still talking stopped the car unconsciously when he was interrupted. The car ceased right before Gu Ning.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d the man asked, but Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t answer his question. He rolled the car window down. \u201cGet in the car,\u201d he said to the outside.Gu Ning saw the car stop in front of her. She was about to move away when she heard a familiar voice.It was the man who had been injured the other night. Gu Ning was a little amazed.But she heard him clearly. The man obviously wanted to give her a lift.Gu Ning was in a hurry now. She didn\u2019t reject, but opened the car door and got inside.Meanwhile, the man on the driver\u2019s seat was shocked. He didn\u2019t expect Leng Shaoting asked him to stop the car to let the female student get inside.But, who the hell was she? How could he had no idea that Leng Shaoting knew such a young female student? Leng Shaoting normally never got in touch with any woman.\u201cThe hospital, thanks,\u201d Gu Ning said without further delay.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40The hospital? Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He was puzzled why she was going to the hospital, but he didn\u2019t ask at all. He said to the man on the driver\u2019s directly, \u201cDrive the car.\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, right!\u201d The man was apparently absent-minded. He got his mind back immediately when he heard Leng Shaoting\u2019s voice. He drove the car ahead quickly.There were many questions in the man\u2019s mind. He kept peeking at Leng Shaoting who was sitting beside, then peeked at Gu Ning from the rearview mirror.This female student was good-looking though, but she was too young. She couldn\u2019t be Leng Shaoting\u2019s type.\u201cFocus on driving,\u201d Leng Shaoting said coldly. The man was frightened, then paid his attention on the road. He was still confused about the relationship between the female student and Leng Shaoting. However, he didn\u2019t have the nerve to ask.Right at that moment, Gu Ning\u2019s phone rang. She picked it up. Before she could say anything, she heard Mu Ke\u2019s worried voice, \u201cBoss, whose car did you get in? Are you safe?\u201dWhen Mu Ke and others followed up, they saw Gu Ning get in a black Maserati.They were all shocked because they knew the car was so expensive. The owner must be the rich or the authorities.Although Gu Ning got in the car must be because she knew the driver, Mu Ke decided to call her to make sure she was safe.\u201cI\u2019m fine. You all can go back to the school now,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cNo, we want to visit your mother as well. We\u2019ll see you in the hospital.\u201d Mu Ke hung up directly before Gu Ning could respond, in case Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t allow them to come.Gu Ning knew they were being kind, thus she agreed.Both Leng Shaoting and the man had good hearing. Although they had no intention to eavesdrop, they were able to hear the talk clearly. Both now understood the reason why Gu Ning was in a hurry.\u201cMay I help?\u201d Leng Shaoting suddenly opened his mouth. The man on the driver\u2019s seat turned the steering wheel in horror. He almost hit the car before them. Luckily, he was a skillful driver and didn\u2019t cause an accident.But it wasn\u2019t his fault though. Leng Shaoting, who was always cold, opened his mouth to offer a help out of the blue, which was totally frightening to him.Leng Shaoting glared at the man. The man immediately paid his attention back to the road. He was also hoping Leng Shaoting wouldn\u2019t say more to frighten him.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care though. Facing Leng Shaoting\u2019s kindness, she rejected with politeness, \u201cThank you so much. I can handle it myself.\u201dSince Gu Ning wanted to deal with it on her own, Leng Shaoting stopped asking. He wasn\u2019t a warm-hearted person. He helped her only because she had helped him.But Leng Shaoting wasn\u2019t aware Gu Ning simply had made a deal with him. He didn\u2019t owe her anything.At the same time, the video of Gu Ning vs. Hao Ran and his friends went viral on their school\u2019s forum.Ever since Hao Ran had challenged Gu Ning, there were many students paid close attention to it.The news that Gu Ning had accepted Hao Ran\u2019s challenge, and the appointed time along with place were all revealed on the forum last night. Many said they would go to watch the fight at 1 pm.But unexpectedly, the fight had ended before 1 pm.Everyone was shocked by the result too.80% of the students didn\u2019t believe Gu Ning could win, while 10% abstained, and the rest 10% believed in Gu Ning. They thought Gu Ning was really powerful on the video in the canteen, and she was very confident.Not everyone would take confidence as arrogance.The result was Gu Ning had won. Gu Ning really had won the fight within several minutes, which was a shocking news!\u201cWhat the f*ck, who said it was 1 pm at the football field. How come it ended so soon?\u201d\u201cExactly, I lost the chance to watch it in person. Who leaked the appointed time and place? Come out, we promise we won\u2019t beat you to death.\u201d\u201cYes! Come out and explain to us.\u201d\u201cCome out!\u201dMeanwhile, the guy who had leaked the appointed time and place last night was now in sadness as well, because he hadn\u2019t watched the fight in person neither.He was also mad.\u201cThis is so unbelievable! Gu Ning alone won Hao Ran and his another two bros? Who can tell me whether it\u2019s true?\u201d\u201cIt must be something wrong with my computer. I need to restart it.\u201d\u2026\u201cI now an admirer of Gu Ning. She\u2019s so cool, isn\u2019t she?\u201d\u201cShe is! She beat Zhang Tianping down to the ground by one move. It\u2019s so amazing!\u201d\u201cAnd her flip is so cool too.\u201d\u2026Some admired Gu Ning while some doubted.\u201cDid Hao Ran and his friends use their full strength? I still can\u2019t believe Gu Ning a girl alone and win them.\u201d\u201cExactly! I doubt it too.\u201d\u2026The minute doubts appeared, those admirers of Gu Ning started to retort.\u201cAre you all blind? I was there in person. I saw it with my eyes. They did fight with full strength! If you don\u2019t believe, you can have a fight with Gu Ning herself, then you\u2019ll know.\u201d\u201cExactly, not everyone is able to do flip in the air.\u201d\u201cGu Ning now is the boss of Hao Ran and his friends. If you dare to question Gu Ning, you are questioning Hao Ran and his friends. Be careful about that! Shao Feifei was almost hit by Hao Ran when she questioned the result on site.\u201dKnowing that, those who had doubts were all quiet now. They were scared of Hao Ran and his friends.\u201cI think I\u2019m going to tell my goddess that I like her. Wish me good luck!\u201d\u201cWish you good luck. Hope you can survive.\u201d\u201cWish you good luck. Actually I want to see a drama.\u201d\u201cWish you good luck. Waiting for the result.\u201d\u201cWish you good luck\u2026\u201dAlthough they were wishing the student good luck, they all actually wanted to see a drama.As for Gu Ning, she couldn\u2019t care less about those discussions.It took half an hour to get to the hospital normally, but the man drove there steadily within 20 minutes.Gu Ning thanked Leng Shaoting, then left the car. She immediately ran to the outpatient department.The Maserati stayed at the same place instead. Leng Shaoting and the man watched Gu Ning leaving.\u201cShaoting, who is this female student? I never saw you help anyone on your own initiative,\u201d the man couldn\u2019t help but ask at the end. He felt extremely uncomfortable to keep it to himself.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Leng Shaoting ignored the man\u2019s question.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41\u201cFine,\u201d the man answered. However, he was now more curious than ever.Since Leng Shaoting wasn\u2019t willing to tell him, there was no need to keep asking. The man decided to do the research on his own. The man, who was Xu Jinchen, believed it was easy for him to find out the truth.While Gu Ning was running, she pulled out her phone, and called Gu Man.The one who had called Gu Ning was Gu Man\u2019s female colleague, Wang Sufen. Wang Sufen got along well with Gu Man. Gu Ning knew her too. After Gu Man had fallen down from the stairs, Wang Sufen and the driver from their factory had driven her to the hospital.Wang Sufen let Gu Ning call Gu Man when she arrived at the hospital, then Wang Sufen would tell her where they were.Because they were already on the road.The phone was answered. Before Gu Ning could say a word, the other side said first, \u201cGu Ning, have you arrived? Your mother is in the hospital now, but we don\u2019t have enough money, so your mother hasn\u2019t been admitted yet. She\u2019s on a patient bed in the hallway of the first floor of the inpatient department now.\u201dHearing that, Gu Ning was slightly annoyed. She was mad not because the hospital wouldn\u2019t admit a patient without money. She understood the hospital wasn\u2019t a charity.However, she felt guilty that Gu Man hadn\u2019t received the treatment on time. Gu Ning rushed to her mother without delay.At the same time, Gu Ning called An Qian to make sure her mother would be administered well and soon.\u201cHi, who\u2019s this?\u201d An Qian didn\u2019t have Gu Ning\u2019s phone number. She was regretting not asking for it those days.Gu Ning said straightforwardly, \u201cMiss An, this is Gu Ning. I need your help now. My mother just fell down the stairs. I haven\u2019t met her yet, and I don\u2019t know how she is right now, but she needs to be admitted. Could you please arrange a VIP patient room and the exam for my mother? I\u2019ll pay the bill later.\u201dGu Ning actually had no idea about An Qian\u2019s position in the hospital, but since she worked here, it would be quicker if she helped.It was about Gu Man\u2019s health. Gu Ning couldn\u2019t waste the time.After An Qian found out the caller was Gu Ning, she felt happy in her heart. She even wanted to complain that Gu Ning hadn\u2019t contacted her recently. However, when An Qian knew Gu Ning\u2019s mother had fallen down from the stairs, she immediately agreed to help.\u201cNo problem. Where are you now?\u201d An Qian asked with anxiety.\u201cI\u2019m about to be at the first floor of the inpatient department. My mother is in the hallway,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cGreat. I\u2019ll make the arrangement right away. Please wait a moment.\u201d An Qian hung up before Gu Ning answered. She arranged it at once.Before long, Gu Ning arrived at the hallway of the first floor in the inpatient department. She found Gu Man there. There was a woman of the same age stood beside Gu Man. She was Wang Sufen.A man, who was about 20 years old, was with Wang Sufen. He was the driver who had sent Gu Man to the hospital.\u201cNice to meet you,\u201d Gu Ning greeted Wang Sufen. Then she immediately checked Gu Man.Gu Man was still unconscious now. Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate to use her Jade Eyes to see through Gu Man\u2019s head. There was only a red swollen injure on the back of her head. Gu Ning was slightly relieved.But now the power of her Jade Eyes was limited. It cost her much power to see through Gu Man\u2019s head. Her face also turned pale afterwards. Thus Gu Ning didn\u2019t have enough power to help Gu Man recover.From having been reborn till now, Gu Ning had never been so eager to have adequate power in her Jade Eyes. In that case, she would be able to help Gu Man.But now she couldn\u2019t do anything.After a few minutes, An Qian came to Gu Ning with several other male doctors.\u201cGu Ning, I\u2019ve already arranged a VIP patient room with exam equipment. Let\u2019s go there now,\u201d An Qian said. Those male doctors pushed the patient bed on which Gu Man was lying ahead.Wang Sufen rounded her eyes in shock.She knew Gu Man\u2019s financial condition well. Gu Man barely could afford the hospitalization cost, but now she was going to stay in a VIP patient room?Although Wang Sufen was curious, it wasn\u2019t appropriate to ask.\u201cThank you so much for driving my mother to the hospital. I understand that you still need to work. We\u2019ll thank you again when my mother wakes up,\u201d Gu Ning said to Wang Sufen and the driver.Gu Ning and her mother basically would buy them a meal or some gifts to thank them.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it. Your mother\u2019s health is the most important thing for you now. Take good care of her, and we\u2019re going back,\u201d Wang Sufen replied, then left with the driver.When Gu Ning and the others walked in the patient room, Mu Ke called her.Mu Ke and his friends had taken the taxi, and was 10 minutes late.\u201cBoss, where are you? We\u2019re in the hospital now,\u201d Mu Ke asked in worry.\u201cRoom V08, seventh floor of the inpatient department,\u201d Gu Ning answered. She hung up directly, because she was in a hurry to visit Gu Man.Mu Ke was slightly surprised when he heard room V08. How come it was a VIP patient room?Though Mu Ke was puzzled, he was sure that he had heard it clearly. It wasn\u2019t the time to doubt. Mu Ke immediately ran ahead when he knew the number of the patient room.An Qian checked Gu Man\u2019s body in person. Gu Ning stood aside. Although she was worried, she stayed quiet. She didn\u2019t want to bother An Qian.Mu Ke and the rest arrived soon. They saw Gu Man was under exam, thus they didn\u2019t walk in right away. They didn\u2019t want to bother them neither.\u201cMu Ke, what\u2019s going on here? How come Gu Ning\u2019s mother is in a VIP patient room?\u201d Yu Mixi didn\u2019t found out Gu Ning\u2019s mother stayed in a VIP patient room till she arrived. She was very surprised since she knew well about the financial condition of Gu Ning\u2019s family.\u201cI have no idea either!\u201d Mu Ke was confused too.\u201cWhy can\u2019t boss\u2019 mother stays in a VIP patient room?\u201d Hao Ran and his bros didn\u2019t know Gu Ning\u2019s background. They all felt puzzled about the talk between Mu Ke and Yu Mixi.Mu Ke then told Hao Ran and his bros about the financial condition of Gu Ning\u2019s family. Hao Ran and his bros had a lot of sympathy for Gu Ning.They believed Gu Ning\u2019s mother stayed in a VIP patient room in order to get a better treatment.Meanwhile, the cost was also high.\u201cWe can\u2019t let boss pay all the bills alone. I\u2019ll pay the medical treatment for her mother,\u201d Hao Ran said. He did that to support his boss.\u201cMe too.\u201dMu Ke, Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping all agreed.Although Zhang Tianping was an orphan, he had opened a bar along with Hao Ran and Qin Zixun. The bar was very profitable, thus he was kind of a rich boy now.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Only Yu Mixi, who was from the same poor family as Gu Ning, felt guilty. She wasn\u2019t able to help Gu Ning at all, since her mother was in need of a large amount of money to pay the medicine now.Mu Ke understood Yu Mixi was sad. He comforted her, \u201cMixi, I know your background. You don\u2019t need to feel guilty at all, because you also need help. If you need us, just let us know.\u201dHearing that, Hao Ran and his bros then found out Yu Mixi\u2019s family was also poor.\u201cExactly! We\u2019re friends now. If you need us, be free to tell us,\u201d Hao Ran and his bros agreed.They didn\u2019t care about money actually. They cherished friendship more.Yu Mixi was so moved, and was about to cry. Although she needed help, she wasn\u2019t willing to owe them a favor.Around half an hour later, the result was out.\u201cGu Ning, you don\u2019t need to worry. Your mother is fine. She just hit the back of her head. There\u2019s only a swollen injury. Besides, your mother fell down from the stairs, only because she lacks of nutrition. She\u2019s weak, and needs a good rest.\u201d An Qian was relieved that Gu Man was fine.\u201cGlad to hear that. When my mother can wake up then?\u201d Gu Ning was also relieved, but she felt hurt that her mother lacks of nutrition.She didn\u2019t want to wait any longer. Once Gu Man woke up, she would tell Gu Man something about her. From now on, she wanted Gu Man to live a good life.\u201cShe needs infusion of nutrition solution now, and probably will be awake within one or two hours,\u201d An Qian said. She then asked a nurse to take some nutrition solution from the pharmacy.Gu Ning saw Mu Ke and the rest earlier on, but she was too worried about Gu Man, so she didn\u2019t walk out to meet them. Now Gu Man was fine, Gu Ning was relieved and went out to meet them.\u201cBoss, how\u2019s your mother?\u201d Mu Ke and others asked when Gu Ning came out.\u201cNothing serious. She just hit her head, and lacks of nutrition.\u201d Gu Ning said airily, but she felt sad in heart.Everyone was greatly relieved, but also had sympathy for Gu Man being in malnutrition.\u201cIt\u2019s late now. You all need to go back to the school. We have classes in the afternoon,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cNo big deal. We don\u2019t care about the classes. We\u2019ll stay here with you,\u201d Hao Ran said. They couldn\u2019t leave Gu Ning alone right now.\u201cExactly, we don\u2019t mind the classes,\u201d Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping agreed. They were used to skipping classes.\u201cBoss, I can ask for a leave this afternoon.\u201d Mu Ke also wanted to stay. Although he seldom asked for a leave normally as a good student, since today was different, he couldn\u2019t abandon Gu Ning.\u201cGu Ning, I can ask for a leave too.\u201d No one was leaving. Yu Mixi of course wasn\u2019t willing to. Moreover, she was still concerned about Gu Ning now.\u201cBoss, please don\u2019t push us away. We must stay with you this afternoon.\u201d Hao Ran said with determination in case Gu Ning would reject.Gu Ning felt touched. Except Yu Mixi, she had just met the rest for a short time, but they all cared about her.\u201cGreat!\u201d Gu Ning knew they wouldn\u2019t leave, so she agreed at the end.\u201cBoss, we\u2019re going to buy some food first. You can stay with your mother,\u201d Hao Ran said. He then pulled Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping to leave.They had come to an agreement already. Mu Ke and Yu Mixi knew clearly Hao Ran and his bros were also going to deal with something else except food.They were going to pay the bill for Gu Man.However, they were told the bill had been paid already.What had happened?\u201cWho paid the bill?\u201d Hao Ran inquired.\u201cDoctor An paid all the costs,\u201d the worker said.\u201cDoctor An? A male or female doctor?\u201d Hao Ran asked. He started to gossip.\u201cA female doctor,\u201d the worker replied.\u201cIs she boss\u2019 friend or relative?\u201d Hao Ran guessed, but since the bill had already been paid, they could only go to buy food.Before An Qian left, she had arranged everything well, and told Gu Ning to call her if any need arose.When An Qian was gone, Mu Ke and Gu Ning called the head teacher to ask for a leave one by one.Zhang Qiuhua didn\u2019t know Gu Ning had won Hao Ran and his friends till now. She was shocked, but also relieved.\u201cSorry, Professor Zhang, my mother is in hospital now. I need to ask for a leave to take care of my mother. And Yu Mixi is with me too. Please allow us to stay,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cOK.\u201d The head teacher couldn\u2019t refuse since her student\u2019s mother had an accident.Half a hour later, before Hao Ran and his bros came back, Gu Man woke up calling Gu Ning\u2019s name. Her voice was full of concern and anxiety.\u201cMom, I\u2019m here.\u201d Gu Ning immediately ran over, catching Gu Man\u2019s hand.\u201cNingning, is it really you?\u201d Seeing Gu Ning, Gu Man was a little surprised. She asked with worries, \u201cHow are you? Did you get hurt?\u201dGu Man said, and wanted to check Gu Ning\u2019s injuries. Gu Ning pressed Gu Man\u2019s hand to stop her. If Gu Man moved, she would pull the needle.\u201cMom, I\u2019m totally fine!\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t know why Gu Man would ask her that, but she comforted her mother at once.\u201cReally? I\u2019ve received photos from Xiaoxiao. I saw you hit by someone. I was terrified.\u201d Gu Man was still in horror. Her body trembled lightly.Knowing that, Gu Ning\u2019s face changed.What? Gu Xiaoxiao had sent photos of her fighting with Hao Ran to Gu Man. Gu Man had fallen down from stairs because of that?Very well. Gu Xiaoxiao irritated her once more.Mu Ke and Yu Mixi were also displeased.Gu Xiaoxiao actually intended to let Gu Man know Gu Ning was in fight with other schoolmates, thus Gu Man would criticize Gu Ning. She had no idea Gu Man would fall.But the accident had already happened, and Gu Ning would never let Gu Xiaoxiao get away with it.Although Gu Ning was in a rage, she still explained to Gu Man with patience, \u201cMom, no one has beaten me. I was simply having fun with my friends. You know Gu Xiaoxiao never likes me. She always picks on me. I refused to apologize, thus she deliberately took those photos. She simply wants you to blame me, but I\u2019m fine as usual.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Gu Ning said, then rolled up her sleeves to let Gu Man check.Although it was winter, the temperature wasn\u2019t low. Gu Ning didn\u2019t wear much. She easily rolled her sleeves up, and her beautiful arms without any wounds were out in the air.\u201cYes, we were just having some fun. We didn\u2019t fight.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah.\u201dMu Ke and Yu Mixi immediately stepped ahead, helping Gu Ning explain to her mother.Gu Man then found out there were other people in the room. They both were in the same school uniform. Gu Man knew they must be Gu Ning\u2019s schoolmates.Gu Man chose to believe Gu Ning. Afterwards, she was completely convinced by Gu Ning and her schoolmates that they hadn\u2019t fight.\u201cThat\u2019s great. That\u2019s great,\u201d Gu Man said.Then, Gu Man looked around the room, and she was surprised.She instantly realized this wasn\u2019t an ordinary patient room. It must be a luxury one.But, she couldn\u2019t afford such a room.\u201cNingning, I\u2019m fine now. Let\u2019s leave the hospital as soon as the infusion ends,\u201d Gu Man said.Gu Ning knew Gu Man well. She comforted her mother, \u201cMom, your head is injured, and you greatly lack of nutrition. You need to have a good rest. Don\u2019t worry about money. I\u2019ll explain to you later.\u201dSince Mu Ke and Yu Mixi were both here, Gu Ning couldn\u2019t tell her mother now.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Gu Man wouldn\u2019t listen to Gu Ning. How could she not worry about money? She knew better than anyone else about their financial condition.\u201cYou have to listen to me, and you can\u2019t leave the hospital without the doctor\u2019s permission. You have no idea how worried I was when you were in unconsciousness. If anything terrible had happened to you, what should I do?\u201d Gu Ning used her ace in the hole, even Mu Ke and Yu Mixi were touched.Gu Man didn\u2019t know what to say all of a sudden. She compromised, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll listen to you.\u201dHowever, Gu Man was still uneasy about the money.Gu Ning knew clearly what her mother was worried about, but she had to wait till her friends were gone.After a while, Hao Ran and his bros were back with many packages of expensive health-care products.Those health-care products were worth thousands at least.Gu Man and Gu Ning were shocked, \u201cWhy did you buy so many of these?\u201d\u201cBoss, nothing is more important than your mother\u2019s health. Please accept all of them!\u201d Hao Ran said.Gu Ning felt moved. She understood their kindness.They were rich kids who never lacked of money. Thus Gu Ning accepted at the end, \u201cGreat, Let\u2019s eat first.\u201d\u201cNingning\u2026\u201d It was unacceptable to Gu Man though, because those products were too expensive.Gu Ning comforted, \u201cMom, it\u2019s fine. They\u2019re my good friends. They do this out of kindness. We can\u2019t reject that.\u201d\u201cExactly, please accept our gifts. We all hope you can recover soon,\u201d Hao Ran and his bros immediately added. They were afraid Gu Man would say no.Now, even Gu Man didn\u2019t want to hurt them.Although Hao Ran and the others didn\u2019t know when Gu Man would wake up, they still had prepared nutritious meal for her.After the meal, An Qian came with another bunch of health-care products.\u201cDoctor An, nice to meet you.\u201d Seeing An Qian came with a lot of health-care products, Gu Man felt very grateful.\u201cGu Ning\u2019s mother, please have a good rest. If you have any need, just tell me. Gu Ning and I are friends. Your health is the most important,\u201d An Qian said kindly.\u201cDoctor An, I even don\u2019t know how to thank you.\u201d Gu Man felt more grateful now.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d An Qian said.An Qian was still on duty, so she left after a short while.In the afternoon, everyone stayed in the room to keep Gu Man\u2019s company. They told jokes once in a while. Gu Man beamed often.Gu Ning didn\u2019t tell anyone else that Gu Man was in hospital, Gu Qing included. She didn\u2019t want to worry them.\u2026Gu Ning didn\u2019t attend classes this afternoon, which became an excuse for Shao Feifei to make fun of Gu Ning.\u201cI think Gu Ning probably is playing around with Hao Ran and his bros. She even didn\u2019t come to school this afternoon.\u201d\u201cI agree. Hao Ran and his bros aren\u2019t good boys after all,\u201d Yang Yulu added.Wu Qingya immediately followed up, \u201cThat will explain what has happened this afternoon! Although Gu Ning isn\u2019t weak, I still believe Hao Ran lost the game on purpose because he likes Gu Ning.\u201d\u201cTry saying these to Gu Ning, Hao Ran and his bros\u2019 faces. Don\u2019t ever badmouth behind their backs, losers,\u201d an admirer of Gu Ning retorted.\u201cExactly, she didn\u2019t come must be because she was in a middle of something. The head teacher said nothing about it. Why do you have to criticize her!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think too highly of yourself. You\u2019re not a princess only because you\u2019re from a rich family.\u201d\u201cExactly! Someone must forget that Hao Ran won\u2019t tolerate her.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Shao Feifei was announced, but she had to admit that she didn\u2019t want to irritate Hao Ran.Or, why she could only badmouth them behind their backs?She didn\u2019t forget what Hao Ran had said to her this noon.Actually, most of the classmates hated Shao Feifei and her friends. They knew these girls enjoyed gossiping and behaved badly, but they didn\u2019t dare to say anything because those girls had great background.However, since they admired Gu Ning now, they couldn\u2019t stand it when Shao Feifei and her friends badmouthed Gu Ning in public. They had to do something.\u2026When An Qian was off-duty, she came to visit Gu Man again.\u201cDoctor An, when can I leave the hospital?\u201d Gu Man asked.An Qian told Gu Man in the way Gu Ning had asked her to do. \u201cYou\u2019ve hit your head. It takes one or two days to make sure that you\u2019re all good. Recurrence of the injury can be terrible.\u201dHearing that, Gu Man was a little scared. If it got worse, it could cost more money. Thus, Gu Man closed her mouth.But in her heart, she was still worried about money.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44\u201cGu Ning\u2019s mother, please don\u2019t worry and relax. It\u2019ll help you recover, and won\u2019t cost much. If you can\u2019t have a good rest, your health will be affected.\u201d An Qian knew Gu Man\u2019s feelings, and used them to comfort as well as threaten her.Gu Man literally had been scared. She tried to relax in order to recover soon and cost less money.After the dinner, Mu Ke and others were gone.Before they left, they asked Gu Ning whether they should teach Gu Xiaoxiao a lesson.Gu Ning said no, she wanted to do it herself. Thus Hao Ran and his bros stayed quiet.There were only Gu Ning and Gu Man in the patient room now.\u201cMom, actually, I had a secret to tell you after this weekend, but since you had an accident, I believe it\u2019s better to tell you now.\u201d Gu Ning suddenly wore a serious face, which made Gu Man feel nervous.\u201cI rescued a person several days ago. He gave me an emerald as a reward. I sold it the other day. Unexpectedly, the emerald is worth 10 million yuan,\u201d Gu Ning said. She behaved like it was a great surprise to her.\u201cWhat? 10 million yuan?\u201dHearing that, Gu Man was stunned. She couldn\u2019t believe her ears.\u201cYes, 10 million. Therefore, you don\u2019t need to worry about the cost at all. We have enough money,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cI planned to take a look at houses these days, and tell you after I bought the house, but the accident happened. Well, I also planned to use a part of the money to do business. Mu Ke runs a jewelry store, which is profitable. I think I\u2019ll buy in some shares.\u201d Gu Ning lied about the shares. She simply wanted to convince her mother by using Mu Ke.Gu Man was totally in shock now. She opened her mouth, but couldn\u2019t say a word.Gu Ning continued, \u201cAnd, after my car accident, my memory suddenly became really good. I can remember anything that I read. I was poor at studying in the past, but now, whatever I\u2019ve read, I can keep it in my mind. I think it\u2019s easy for me to get into the best university in the capital city too. Besides, it will be a waste if I don\u2019t use my skill to do business.\u201dAt the end, Gu Ning didn\u2019t forget to compliment herself.At short notice, Gu Man cried. No one knew whether she cried out of horror, happiness or because of something else.\u201cMom,\u201d Gu Ning was a little nervous. She knew it was hard for Gu Man to accept the truth, but she was going to tell her the news sooner or later.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Ningning, you\u2019re finally growing better and better. Mom is truly happy for you.\u201d Other than happiness, Gu Man also had mixed emotions, especially sadness.Gu Man was happy that Gu Ning was growing better. However, those rich kids all lived a life without any worries, while Gu Ning started to do business.Gu Man blamed herself for being useless. She did not provide her daughter with a good life.\u201cOh, how did you rescue the person? Were you in danger? Is it reliable that the person gave you such an expensive object? Will you be in any trouble later?\u201d Gu Man asked in worry. She cared about her daughter\u2019s safety most.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. The person is super rich. He won\u2019t care about it. I met him today. It was him who drove me to the hospital,\u201d Gu Ning said. Gu Ning tried to make the man sound like a good guy to comfort Gu Man.She didn\u2019t lie though. Although the man was cold, he didn\u2019t seem like a bad guy.After that, Gu Man was finally relieved.\u201cMom, my second aunt always helps us. I plan to buy a house for her family too. I want to help them,\u201d Gu Ning said.Hearing that, Gu Man felt like crying again. She was so touch by Gu Ning\u2019s kindness. \u201cGreat, great. Ningning, mom feels so proud of you for being grateful.\u201dGu Man also wanted to thank the family of Gu Qing.She would never forget their help.\u201cBut mom, I want you to know something now. I will only take the family of my second aunt as my relatives in the Gu Family. As for my eldest and third uncle, both you and I know how they treat us. Accordingly, even if I become rich in the future, I won\u2019t help them if they need my help. As for grandmother, although I hate her, you\u2019re her daughter after all. It\u2019s our responsibility to support her, but I\u2019ll decide how much we should support her financially. If grandmother is greedy, I won\u2019t tolerate her either,\u201d Gu Ning said solemnly. She wouldn\u2019t give in.Actually, through all those years, Gu Man already felt hurt by the rest of the people in the Gu Family. Thus she agreed on what Gu Ning had said.\u201cGreat, mom agrees with you,\u201d Gu Man answered without further hesitation.Gu Ning was relieved when Gu Man agreed. She had been worried that Gu Man would forget the humiliation and disdain only because those bad people were family.\u201cOh, please don\u2019t tell my second aunt that I\u2019m going to buy them a house. Tell them when the thing is done,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSure,\u201d Gu Man replied.\u201cBesides, Mu Ke is going to City G to deal with some business this weekend. Mixi and I will go with him as well. We\u2019re going to learn. Please don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll take good care of myself.\u201d Gu Ning again used Mu Ke and Yu Mixi as an excuse to comfort Gu Man.Although Gu Man was concerned, she didn\u2019t stop Gu Ning.She felt Gu Ning had grown up, and was able to make decisions on her own. Since she had a plan, Gu Man believed that she shouldn\u2019t burden her daughter.\u201cMom, I also hope you don\u2019t need to work that hard. Thus, why don\u2019t you quit? I have enough money now, and I\u2019m going to earn more. I can support you now. You can go shop, take care of your skin, buy some makeup, or travel. Mom, I want you to enjoy your life. If you still want to work, you can tell me what you like to do. I can buy a small shop for you. We\u2019ll hire someone to run the shop. If you feel bored, you can go and take a look. If you don\u2019t want to, you can stay at home,\u201d Gu Ning added.To further make Gu Man feel comfortable in her heart, Gu Ning continued. \u201cMom, we\u2019re mother and daughter. We\u2019re a family. Mine is yours. Please don\u2019t feel guilty at all. I\u2019ll be happy as long as you\u2019re happy.\u201dGu Man felt guilty at the beginning. She blamed herself for not offering a good life to Gu Ning, and even let Gu Ning support her financially.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45But what Gu Ning had said at the end lifted all her mental burdens.What Gu Man wanted most was for Gu Ning to be happy. Since Gu Ning wanted her to do so, Gu Man chose to listen to her daughter.Gu Man wouldn\u2019t really do anything, but since their life had been improved, she could change her lifestyle.\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll quit my job, and I\u2019ll depend on you from now on,\u201d Gu Man joked.\u201cSure, we\u2019ll live a better and better life from now on.\u201d Gu Ning was finally relieved.Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s family lived in a big house in an expensive area near the downtown.After the evening class, Gu Xiaoxiao went back home, complaining to her mother Lin Lijuan, \u201cMom, Gu Ning said she won\u2019t apologize to me.\u201dLin Lijuan was about 45 years old, but she had taken good care of her skin and looked much younger.Lin Lijuan had a son and a daughter. Her son was named Gu Qingyun and was 20 years old. He was a sophomore majoring in medicine in the Capital Medical University.Her daughter was Gu Xiaoxiao.\u201cWhat? How could she be so bold? Isn\u2019t she afraid of us?\u201d Lin Lijuan was surprised.\u201cShe\u2019s so bold now! She even fought with Hao Ran in our school today!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said. However, she didn\u2019t mention that Gu Ning was Hao Ran\u2019s boss now. She didn\u2019t want the rest of the people in the Gu Family to think Gu Ning was better now.\u201cWhat?\u201dHearing that, Lin Lijuan was shocked. Gu Ning was so different now.Lin Lijuan knew who Hao Ran was. Hao Ran was from a powerful family. She had even asked Gu Xiaoxiao to have a good relationship with the boy. It could be helpful someday in the future.Lin Lijuan also knew Hao Ran had a bad temper. It wasn\u2019t easy to get along with him.After the shock, Lin Lijuan laughed. \u201cI think that\u2019s good. She has bad blood with Hao Ran. She\u2019s doomed.\u201dLin Lijuan didn\u2019t believe Gu Ning could defeat Hao Ran. She assumed Gu Ning was the loser.\u201cBut\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao almost told her mother that Gu Ning was Hao Ran\u2019s boss now, but she restricted herself. \u201cBut, Gu Ning won\u2019t apologize to me. I hate her.\u201d\u201cWhat happened? What happened with Gu Ning?\u201d Before Lin Lijuan could say something, an old woman\u2019s voice sounded.Then, a 60-year-old woman walked out from the passage.This woman was Gu Ning\u2019s grandmother.Gu Ning\u2019s grandmother lived a good life, so she was still as energetic as always.She was a stubborn old lady, but didn\u2019t dare to stand up against Lin Lijuan.Although Lin Lijuan was pushy, she would ignore her mother-in-law as long as she was in control.All in all, Lin Lijuan and her mother-in-law got along well with each other.Gu Ning\u2019s grandmother had visited her relatives yesterday so she had no idea about what had happened between Gu Ning and Gu Xiaoxiao.\u201cGrandma, Gu Ning hit me with a plate yesterday in the canteen. She even slapped me, and won\u2019t apologize. I\u2019m so annoyed,\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao complained at once when she saw her grandmother.\u201cWhat? Gu Ning dared to hit you with a plate and slapped you! She\u2019s such a bastard.\u201d The old lady was in a rage.Actually, in the old lady\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning was a humiliation to the Gu Family, because she didn\u2019t have a father.Gu Ning hated her grandmother too, because her grandmother had been calling her a bastard ever since she had been a little girl.\u201cExactly! Grandma, could you please kick them out of the old house?\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao begged. She looked vicious.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d The old lady was a little reluctant to do that. She disliked Gu Ning and Gu Man very much, but never thought of kicking them out.After all, Gu Man was her daughter. She felt sympathetic to her.Most importantly, before her husband had passed away, he had warned her not to kick Gu Man and Gu Ning out of the old house, or he would come to her even if he had to become a ghost when he was dead.Gu Ning\u2019s grandmother believed in superstitions, so she never had the idea of kicking Gu Man and Gu Ning out.Seeing her grandmother wasn\u2019t willing to do that, Gu Xiaoxiao knew it couldn\u2019t work. She then changed her mind. \u201cGrandma, could you ask Gu Ning to apologize to me. As long as I\u2019m satisfied, I can forgive her.\u201d\u201cNo problem. I will call Gu Ning right now, and tell her to apologize to you.\u201d This time, the old lady didn\u2019t reject, but pulled out her phone at once.But the old lady didn\u2019t have Gu Ning\u2019s phone number because she hated Gu Ning so much, so she could only call Gu Man.It was around 10 pm, and wasn\u2019t very late. Gu Ning and Gu Man hadn\u2019t gone to bed yet. They were watching TV.At that moment, Gu Man\u2019s phone rang. It was her mother.Before she could say a word, her mother shouted in anger, \u201cGu Man, what a daughter you have! How dare she hit Xiaoxiao with a plate, and even slap her! A bastard is a bastard! She has no manners at all! Ask Gu Ning to apologize to Xiaoxiao until Xiaoxiao is satisfied!\u201dIt was an irresistible order.Gu Man\u2019s mother almost yelled, so Gu Ning could hear her clearly. Gu Ning actually didn\u2019t care how her grandmother thought of her, but she couldn\u2019t stand her grandmother calling her a bastard.Gu Man knew it wasn\u2019t Gu Ning\u2019s fault. She felt aggrieved.And hearing her mother call her daughter a bastard, Gu Man was hurt.Although Gu Man was weak, she cared about her daughter. She would not allow her daughter to be called a bastard.This time, Gu Man was totally annoyed. She almost roared with tears, \u201cMom, Ningning is not a bastard. She\u2019s my daughter. Even though you dislike her, you can\u2019t swear at her in that way. You can\u2019t just believe Xiaoxiao\u2019s words. Ningning didn\u2019t hurt her at all. Besides, it wasn\u2019t Ningning\u2019s fault. It was Xiaoxiao who humiliated Ningning first. Why should Ningning apologize!\u201dThe old lady was surprised by Gu Man\u2019s emotional outburst. She didn\u2019t get her mind back till a while had passed. Then she was more irritated than surprised. \u201cGu Ning is a bastard. I won\u2019t admit she\u2019s my granddaughter. She must apologize to Xiaoxiao, or you both have to leave the old house!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46The old lady was actually so mad that she had blurted out what Gu Xiaoxiao wanted. She didn\u2019t really want to kick Gu Man and Gu Ning out. She just wanted to threaten them.Gu Xiaoxiao, who stood aside, was gloating over her victory.\u201cMom\u2026\u201d Gu Man called helplessly. She wanted to argue back, but burst into tears and could barely say a word.Gu Ning immediately grabbed the phone from Gu Man. She said coldly, \u201cYou old bitch, let me tell you something. I will not apologize. Do you want to kick us out of this old house? Fine, we\u2019ll move out, but remember what you\u2019ve said today. I\u2019m not your granddaughter. No matter what happens to you all in the future, it\u2019s none of my business!\u201dThen, Gu Ning hung up with great force.Gu Man didn\u2019t stop or blame Gu Ning. Her heart was completely broken due to her mother\u2019s attitude towards them.On the other side, the old lady was trembling in anger, swearing at Gu Ning loudly.\u201cLijuan, if Gu Man and Gu Ning won\u2019t move out tomorrow, you can find someone to kick them out!\u201d The old lady had intended to threaten Gu Man so that Gu Ning would apologize to Gu Xiaoxiao.But now that Gu Ning had yelled at her, the old lady decided to kick them out of the old house.Meanwhile, both Gu Xiaoxiao and Lin Lijuan were excited. They had no sympathy for Gu Man and Gu Ning at all.In the hospital.\u201cMom, let\u2019s stay in the hospital these days. I\u2019ll go to the old house and bring our important stuff back tomorrow. And I\u2019ll buy a new house as soon as possible, then we can move in,\u201d Gu Ning said.Although Gu Ning had already decided to buy a house in Fenghua Luxury Mansion, she needed to go to City G to earn more money first.\u201cGreat.\u201d Gu Man listened to Gu Ning on everything now.Since Gu Man stayed in a VIP patient room, nurses would take good care of her. Moreover, An Qian also accorded special attention to Gu Man. Gu Ning didn\u2019t need to worry about her mother.The next morning, Gu Ning went back to her school.Gu Xiaoxiao went to school early too. She couldn\u2019t wait to make fun of Gu Ning.Although Gu Ning was still mad about what had happened yesterday, she continued to finish her daily routine. She, along with Mu Ke and Yu Mixi were running in the early morning. This time Hao Ran, Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping also joined them.Gu Ning didn\u2019t specifically tell them how many circles to run because they were all active in training.Hao Ran and his bros even performed better than Mu Ke.This morning, Yu Mixi followed them running at the same pace for a circle. She slowed down obviously in the second circle. By the third circle, she was jogging. At last, Yu Mixi still finished five circles, which amounted to 2,000 meters.Mu Ke finished eight circles while Hao Ran together with his bros followed Gu Ning and finished 10 circles.After the running, Hao Ran and his bros were all exhausted. They sank down to the ground immediately.Gu Ning was in a better condition than them. She was a little tired, but not worn out. Her body was still in her control.At the beginning, Gu Ning\u2019s speed and steps stayed steady, but after seven or eight circles, she obviously slowed down.She wasn\u2019t physically strong after all. In her last lifetime, she could still catch her breath after dozens of kilometres.She had trained herself day by day to get a strong body in her last lifetime. In this lifetime, she was determined to train herself continuously to have a strong body.After a long break, Hao Ran and his bros were able to utter a word.\u201cB-boss. How-how come you-you don\u2019t seem exhausted?\u201d Hao Ran asked with great admiration.\u201cExactly!\u201d Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping agreed.\u201cAs long as you keep on exercising, you\u2019ll get stronger and stronger. You can all do it easily in the future,\u201d Gu Ning encouraged them.Yes, as long as you kept on exercising, you would get stronger and stronger. Dozens of kilometres wouldn\u2019t be a difficult task to finish.Anyone with determination could do that.Hearing that, all the boys were excited. \u201cI will keep on training, and be stronger!\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201d\u201cAlright, I have something to deal with this afternoon. You can do whatever you want,\u201d Gu Ning said. She needed to go to the old house to take some important stuff, then she would never walk into it again.\u201cBoss, are you going to the hospital to visit your mother? We\u2019ll go with you.\u201d The boys all believed Gu Ning was going to visit Gu Man.\u201cNo thanks. I\u2019m not going to the hospital,\u201d Gu Ning refused. She didn\u2019t want to say anything further. Hao Ran and his bros then closed their mouth.Gu Ning and her friends went back to their classrooms several minutes before the morning class began. The seventh classroom was on the second floor. Hao Ran and his bros went to their classroom when they arrived at the second floor. Gu Ning and the other two went straight to the third floor.The minute they went upstairs, they saw Gu Xiaoxiao leaning against the railings alone.The three of them were all angry, because they knew Gu Xiaoxiao was the cause of Gu Man\u2019s fall.Gu Ning immediately knew they reason why Gu Xiaoxiao was here. She wanted to make fun of Gu Ning.But to Gu Ning\u2019s surprise Chen Ziyao, Qin Zheng and their friends were absent.In fact, Chen Ziyao hadn\u2019t come to school yet and Qin Zheng and his friends seemed to be a little afraid of Gu Ning, so they didn\u2019t come either.Gu Xiaoxiao enjoyed her victory so much that she even ignored the anger of Mu Ke along with others. She laughed when she saw Gu Ning. \u201cGu Ning. I told you to apologize to me, and you wouldn\u2019t listen to me. How dare you yell at our grandma! Well, grandma demands that you and your mother move out of the old house today or you\u2019ll be kicked out.\u201dHearing that, Mu Ke and Yu Mixi rounded their eyes in shock.What? If Gu Ning didn\u2019t apologize, she would be kicked out?At the beginning they had thought Gu Xiaoxiao must be bragging. The Gu Family wouldn\u2019t kick Gu Ning and her mother out because of such a small disagreement. Unexpectedly, the Gu Family did.That was so vicious!\u201cI will move out before tomorrow,\u201d Gu Ning said calmly.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning could still remain calm now.She was disappointed that she failed to see Gu Ning being nervous and terrified. Gu Xiaoxiao believed Gu Ning must be pretending, and she wanted to tear Gu Ning\u2019s disguise apart.Thus, even though Gu Ning had promised she would move out, Gu Xiaoxiao still didn\u2019t want to leave Gu Ning alone.\u201cGu Ning, even though you don\u2019t care about yourself, how can you not care about your mother? The rent outside is so high. Can you afford it? If you apologize to me till I\u2019m satisfied, I can ask grandma to let you stay,\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao continued. She was eager to let Gu Ning beg her. She wanted to stay proud before Gu Ning.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47In Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning could never be better than her. Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to bully and make fun of Gu Ning forever. Now Gu Ning dared to stand up against her, which was unacceptable to Gu Xiaoxiao.\u201cGu Xiaoxiao, stop it. Hao Ran and his bros along with me won\u2019t let our boss be homeless.\u201d Mu Ke couldn\u2019t tolerate it any longer. He criticized Gu Xiaoxiao at once.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was annoyed. She didn\u2019t expect Mu Ke and other boys would treat Gu Ning so well. Why? Why was Gu Ning so lucky?No, she couldn\u2019t accept it.Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes were full of jealousy. She deliberately raised her voice. \u201cGu Ning, how could you be so shameless and behave like a mistress who relies on a man to support her\u2026\u201dGu Xiaoxiao\u2019s voice immediately attracted lots of attention.At the same time, Gu Ning became mad. Before Gu Xiaoxiao could finish, Gu Ning raised her hand and slapped Gu Xiaoxiao with a snap sound. Gu Xiaoxiao shouted in pain.Gu Xiaoxiao was struck dumb. She was surprised that Gu Ning dared to hit her, even though it wasn\u2019t the first time.Gu Ning looked at Gu Xiaoxiao coldly. Her sight was like a sharp icy knife. Gu Xiaoxiao was frightened at once.Moreover, the intense cold which spread from Gu Ning surrounded Gu Xiaoxiao making her tremble.Gu Ning said with solemnity, \u201cGu Xiaoxiao, who told you I rely on a man to support me? Don\u2019t spread that rumor, or I\u2019ll sue you for slander.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao tried to retort, but Gu Ning raised her hand again. Two palms fell heavily on Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s face with two snapping sounds.This time, Gu Ning used even more strength than the last time. Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s cheeks swelled at once. She screamed in pain, \u201cGu Ning, why did you hit me?\u201dGu Xiaoxiao\u2019s scream was heard by all the students on the third floor. The morning class hadn\u2019t begun yet, and the students all ran out to see what was going on.Gu Xiaoxiao was a beautiful girl who was from a rich family. She was also a student in the top classroom. Many students had heard of her name. As for Gu Ning, after what had happened yesterday, she gained great fame among her schoolmates. Everyone knew who these two girls were.Following Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s question, the crowd looked to Gu Ning, wanting to know the reason why Gu Ning hit Gu Xiaoxiao.Gu Ning ignored the attention from the onlookers. She coldly said to Gu Xiaoxiao instead, \u201cBecause you sent photos of me in a fight to my mother yesterday. My mother had been scared and fell down the stairs. You\u2019re lucky that my mother wasn\u2019t hurt seriously, or it would cost more than two palms.\u201dHearing that, everyone knew the context.Since Gu Xiaoxiao deserved this, no one felt sympathy for her.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was shocked by Gu Ning\u2019s explanation. She didn\u2019t expect it would end up like that. She merely wanted Gu Man to criticize Gu Ning.Meanwhile, she didn\u2019t feel guilty at all. She only felt a little upset because she had hurt someone.\u201cGu Xiaoxiao, stop crossing the line. I will not feel sorry about what I do to you from now on,\u201d Gu Ning warned her at the end. Then she walked away directly.Mu Ke and Yu Mixi glared at Gu Xiaoxiao, then left too.After Gu Ning was gone, the crowd started to discuss immediately.\u201cHow could Gu Xiaoxiao be so vicious! It\u2019s none of her business that Gu Ning fought with others. How could she send Gu Ning\u2019s mother a message to terrify her! Gu Ning\u2019s mother even fell down the stairs.\u201d\u201cExactly! She even said Gu Ning relies on a boy to support her. She deserved to be hit.\u201dMost of the student chose to believe Gu Ning, because Gu Ning seemed so angry.\u201cWhy would Qin Zheng like such a vicious girl?\u201d an admirer of Qin Zheng said with dissatisfaction.\u201cHe probably just likes her appearance!\u201d\u201cBirds of a feather flock together! I\u2019ve seen Qin Zheng pick on Gu Ning.\u201d\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ve seen that too!\u201dThis time, Qin Zheng was also criticized by the crowd. He deserved it too.\u201cYou people\u2026\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao was so mad, and she couldn\u2019t tolerate herself being criticized before everyone. She ran downstairs crying.She had been slapped three times by Gu Ning. Her cheeks were red and swollen. She felt too embarrassed to go back to her classroom, so she went back home afterwards.When Gu Xiaoxiao ran away, the bell rang. Everyone immediately went inside their classrooms.Gu Xiaoxiao met the head teacher of the first classroom on her way out of the teaching building.The head teacher was named Wang Chengqi. He was a serious man with glasses, in his early forties.Wang Chengqi was about to question Gu Xiaoxiao about where she was going when the morning classes began, but he noticed the red marks on her cheeks. He was a little surprised. \u201cGu Xiaoxiao, what happened to your face?\u201dSeeing Wang Chengqi, Gu Xiaoxiao was slightly unwilling to tell the truth at first, but then she still explained, \u201cIt\u2019s Gu Ning from the forth classroom. I had an argument with her, and she slapped me three times. I feel too embarrassed to go back to my classroom.\u201dThe reason why Gu Xiaoxiao wasn\u2019t willing to tell Wang Chengqi the truth was that she knew Wang Chengqi was a upright person. Gu Xiaoxiao wasn\u2019t hopeful that Wang Chengqi would stand up for her.Although Gu Xiaoxiao was selfish and didn\u2019t feel guilty at all about what she had done to Gu Ning, she wasn\u2019t dumb. She knew this time was her fault.Thus Gu Xiaoxiao knew clearly that it wouldn\u2019t be helpful even though she told the teacher.That was also the reason why she had turned to her family instead of her teacher for help when Gu Ning had hit her with a plate last time.Her family would always protect her no matter what she had done.Indeed, Wang Chengqi and Zhang Qiuhua were the same kind of teacher. They both were honest and never yield to power or wealth.Accordingly, though feeling displeased, Wang Chengqi didn\u2019t criticize Gu Ning at once.Gu Xiaoxiao had said herself that Gu Ning had slapped her because of an argument.Either because Gu Ning was bad-tempered or because Gu Xiaoxiao had irritated her, Gu Ning had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao.Wang Chengqi got to know about Gu Ning on the school\u2019s forum yesterday as well.Although he didn\u2019t like students who fought, he had to admit Gu Ning was powerful to be able to defeat three boys.\u201cDo you think you\u2019ve done anything wrong in this argument?\u201d Wang Chengqi asked. If Gu Xiaoxiao had not done anything wrong, he would help her, otherwise he would not get involved.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Gu Xiaoxiao was so eager to say she had done nothing wrong, but she changed her mind. \u201cI did say something terrible.\u201dHearing that, Wang Chengqi immediately understood. \u201cThen go back home and use ice blocks to cover your face. You\u2019ll recover soon.\u201dThen, Gu Xiaoxiao left.But after a second, Gu Xiaoxiao called her mother Lin Lijuan and complained. She told Lin Lijuan that Gu Ning had just slapped her three times.She didn\u2019t say why Gu Ning had slapped her of course. No matter why Gu Ning had slapped her, Lin Lijuan would always blame Gu Ning.\u201cThe bloody bitch. Bastard! How dare she slap my lovely daughter! Sweetie, you come back home now. I\u2019ll never let her get away with it,\u201d Lin Lijuan said in great anger.The minute Lin Lijuan hung up, she called Gu Man.Gu Man was asleep at that time. The ringtone woke her up.Gu Man took a look at the phone. The caller was Lin Lijuan. She didn\u2019t want to answer it because she knew Lin Lijuan wasn\u2019t a kind person.However, the phone continued to ring. Gu Man had to answer it at the end.\u201cWhat?\u201d Gu Man asked coldly.\u201cGu Man, your daughter slapped Xiaoxiao this morning. If you don\u2019t bring Gu Ning to apologize to Xiaoxiao, I\u2019ll make you both pay for it!\u201d Lin Lijuan shouted.Gu Man was a little surprised at first, then immediately realized what had happened. She didn\u2019t blame Gu Ning at all, but questioned Lin Lijuan, \u201cDo you know why Ningning has slapped Xiaoxiao? Do you think Ningning must be bullied and stay quiet, while Xiaoxiao is superior to my daughter?\u201dLin Lijuan didn\u2019t feel guilty at all. She said with arrogance, \u201cOf course. Gu Ning can\u2019t compare with Xiaoxiao. Xiaoxiao is our dear daughter, while Gu Ning is merely a bastard.\u201d\u201cLin Lijuan!\u201d Gu Man\u2019s face turned red in anger. She shouted, \u201cStop calling Ningning a bastard. She is my daughter!\u201d\u201cSo what? She doesn\u2019t have a father anyway. She\u2019s a bastard,\u201d Lin Lijuan continued.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Gu Man was deeply hurt, but couldn\u2019t argue back. She hung up, and burst into tears.Ningning had a father. They hadn\u2019t been abandoned. Ningning\u2019s father had only passed away.Lin Lijuan was hung up on by Gu Man. She was so annoyed that she almost smashed her phone. After a while, she called again because she wasn\u2019t done yet.However, Gu Man wouldn\u2019t answer the call. Lin Lijuan even used Gu Man\u2019s mother\u2019s phone to call her. Gu Man wouldn\u2019t answer either.Both Lin Lijuan and Gu Man\u2019s mother were in a rage now.\u201cHow dare they do that! Are they going to leave the Gu Family? Do they think they can survive without us?\u201d Gu Man\u2019s mother snapped.If Gu Man and Gu Ning had heard their talk, they would laugh out in anger.For the past dozens of years, the Gu Family had never helped them. Gu Man and Gu Ning had always depended on themselves.And the old house was left by Gu Man\u2019s father. Besides, Gu Man paid the rent.\u2026Qin Zheng texted Gu Xiaoxiao because she didn\u2019t come to classes. He then found out that Gu Ning had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao, and Gu Xiaoxiao went back home afterwards.Knowing Gu Ning had slapped Gu Xiaoxiao, Qin Zheng was mad at Gu Ning.But he wasn\u2019t as angry as he thought he would be.He didn\u2019t know why.In the fourth classroom, Shao Feifei stared at Gu Ning unkindly as usual, and Gu Ning still ignored her.After the morning class, Chu Peihan walked into the fourth classroom in anger towards Gu Ning.Everyone believed Chu Peihan was here to pick on Gu Ning. Some felt worried for Gu Ning while some were waiting to see a drama.Basically only Shao Feifei and her friends couldn\u2019t wait to see the drama.However, Gu Ning glanced at Chu Peihan calmly. She didn\u2019t believe Chu Peihan was going to cause her any trouble.Chu Peihan went to Gu Ning, standing and staring at her from a higher position. She looked mad. \u201cCongratulations, Gu Ning! I had just left the school for two days, and you suddenly become the center. Now no one cares about me as the most powerful girl in the school.\u201dGu Ning leaned backwards slightly. Her arms crossed before her chest. She looked at ease, then asked airily, \u201cSo?\u201dSo?Everyone thought there would be a fight.However, they were terribly wrong.\u201cSo, I must join you! I call you boss, and you teach me how to fight. Of course, if you need my support, feel free to let me know,\u201d Chu Peihan said with great sincerity.Everyone was shocked. They were not going to fight? How was it possible? Why did they suddenly become a group?It was totally unacceptable to Shao Feifei and her friends.Why was Gu Ning so lucky to have all those students who were from powerful families, be her friends?\u201cOk.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t reject.It was exactly what Chu Peihan had hoped. She was excited now.Chu Peihan used a pen on Gu Ning\u2019s desk to write down numbers on her notebook. \u201cThis is my phone number. Text me.\u201dThen, she turned around and left.When Gu Xiaoxiao got home, her grandmother and mother saw her red, swollen cheeks, and both of them hated Gu Ning to death.\u2026At a break between classes, the head teacher asked Gu Ning about her mother\u2019s health.Gu Ning didn\u2019t hide the truth. She just didn\u2019t tell her teacher the reason why her mother fell down.The moment that morning classes were over Gu Ning left her school taking a taxi to the old house.She packed up some important stuff, throwing some abandoned stuff into the trash bin, then left.Gu Ning went to a delivery company first. She addressed the key to her grandmother before she went to the hospital.When she arrived at the hospital, it was already 1:40 pm. It was 50 minutes away from the afternoon classes. Gu Ning didn\u2019t have much time. She left after she had a small talk with her mother.She would wait till the evening class was over, then talk with her mother.It was already Thursday. Gu Ning planned to go to City G the next afternoon. She had booked a plane ticket and hotel on the Internet yesterday.She would fly to City G at 7:30 pm tomorrow, and arrive there around 8:30 pm.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49A few hours later, Gu Ning\u2019s grandmother received the key.The second the old lady saw the key, she almost lost her breath. She didn\u2019t expect Gu Man and Gu Ning would really do that.Although the old lady was harsh, she wouldn\u2019t kick them out if Gu Man along with Gu Ning apologized to Gu Xiaoxiao.However, Gu Man and Gu Ning would move out rather than apologize.\u201cWell, very well. Let\u2019s see how tough they can be.\u201d the old lady clenched her teeth in anger.She believed Gu Man and Gu Ning would move to Gu Qing\u2019s place because they were close.Thus, the old lady immediately called Gu Qing, and forbade her to help Gu Man and Gu Ning.Gu Xiaoxiao was greatly pleased that Gu Ning and her mother moved out of the old house. She would never forget that Gu Ning had slapped her three times this morning.Gu Qing didn\u2019t know what had happened until her mother called her, but Gu Man hadn\u2019t actually contacted her.Besides, Gu Qing was irritated when her mother forbade her to help Gu Man.Gu Qing seldom dared to argue with her mother, but this time she could stand it. \u201cMom, Gu Man is your biological daughter after all. How could you be so cruel?\u201dShe thought her mother simply disliked Gu Man and Gu Ning, but didn\u2019t expect her mother would be so cold-blooded.Her mother always liked sons over daughters. She and her sister Gu Man never had much of their mother\u2019s love. In addition to that, they had been bullied by their brothers, and had even done all the housework throughout their childhood.If it hadn\u2019t been for their father, they probably would not even have attended school.Gu Qing hadn\u2019t been good at studying, and had given up on receiving an education after high school. As for Gu Man, she had dropped out of her college because she had gotten pregnant.The old lady didn\u2019t expect Gu Qing would dare to argue with her. She shouted in anger, \u201cI don\u2019t need you to teach me! If you ever take me as your mother, follow my order! Gu Man and her daughter deserve this. Let\u2019s see how tough they can be!\u201dThen, the old lady hung up with great force.Gu Qing was hurt by her mother\u2019s behavior. She decided not to listen to her mother. She was also worried Gu Man and Gu Qing would be homeless. She called Gu Man at once, providing help for them.Although there were only two rooms in her house, she thought it was acceptable to let Gu Man and Gu Ning live in one.Gu Man didn\u2019t reject Gu Qing\u2019s call. After Gu Man found out Gu Qing already knew they had moved out of the old house, Gu Man told Gu Qing she was in hospital.Knowing Gu Man had had an accident, Gu Qing couldn\u2019t wait to visit her. Though it was just an hour before Gu Qing was off-duty, she asked for leave and went straight to the hospital.Gu Qing didn\u2019t find out that Gu Man stayed in a VIP patient room until she arrived. She was extremely astonished.Gu Ning had told her mother not to tell Gu Qing the truth for now, thus Gu Man only explained to Gu Qing that a doctor in this hospital was Gu Ning\u2019s friend. Gu Ning had done the doctor a big favor, and the doctor had arranged everything.As for why they had moved out of the old house, Gu Man didn\u2019t hide it and told Gu Qing the whole story because they were close sisters.After that, Gu Qing was really mad at her mother as well as Lin Lijuan and Gu Xiaoxiao. She also believed Gu Ning shouldn\u2019t apologize.Gu Xiaoxiao had been so selfish and overbearing. She deserved the slaps.Although Gu Ning would have bad blood with the Gu Family and had even moved out from the old house, Gu Qing was happy to see Gu Ning could fight back.Gu Qing was actually concerned that Gu Ning would suffer more if she continuously behaved like a coward.\u201cGu Man, you and Ningning can stay in my place. It takes time to find a new house. You don\u2019t need to rush,\u201d Gu Qing said.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about us. I have to stay in the hospital for a few days. Ningning and I will temporarily stay here. We\u2019re finding a new place now. I believe we\u2019ll have a new home after a few days,\u201d Gu Man explained.\u201cFine.\u201d Gu Qing didn\u2019t insist.\u201cOh, please don\u2019t tell others I stay here. Please keep it to yourself,\u201d Gu Man said.\u201cI understand. Don\u2019t worry,\u201d Gu Qing answered. She wouldn\u2019t tell others.\u2026After the afternoon classes were over Gu Ning, Yu Mixi, Mu Ke, Hao Ran and his bros along with Chu Peihan gathered together.Other than Yu Mixi, the others were all surprised.\u201cWow. Bros and sisters, come on, let\u2019s have a WeChat group for communication!\u201d Chu Peihan greeted the others the minute she saw them.Chu Peihan was an outgoing girl. Although she wasn\u2019t familiar with Mu Ke or Hao Ran and his bros, she didn\u2019t feel strange at all since they were in a group now.Hearing that, everyone knew Chu Peihan had taken Gu Ning as her boss too.But they still looked to Gu Ning for confirmation.Gu Ning gave them an affirmative nod. Those young teenagers became good friends soon.Only Yu Mixi, who was introverted, stayed a little shy and quiet, but the others didn\u2019t ignore her, so Yu Mixi didn\u2019t feel lonely.She tried not to stay quiet, and talked to the others gradually.After a while, everyone added each other\u2019s WeChat accounts. They even had a WeChat group called \u201cFamily of Fighters\u201d.Gu Ning was speechless. Didn\u2019t it sound violent?Everyone else liked that name very much so Gu Ning didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cCome on, the group leader needs to send us a big red envelope,\u201d Hao Ran encouraged.\u201cNo problem, there you go!\u201d Chu Peihan, the group leader, said.She sent out a big red envelope of 888 yuan. There were seven people in the WeChat group, and everyone could get an uncertain amount of money depending on their luck.Gu Ning was the luckiest one. She got 300 yuan.Then was Yu Mixi who got more than 200 yuan.Chu Peihan and others shared the rest of the money. Hao Ran only got three yuan, and he complained. \u201cWhat? How could I be so unlucky! Three yuan? You must be kidding me.\u201dAfter that, the crowd went to have a meal first, and then went to train in the small forest.Chu Peihan hadn\u2019t witnessed how good Gu Ning\u2019s kung fu was yet, so she was excited to have a try. The minute they had arrived at the woods, she challenged Gu Ning to fight with her.Chu Peihan was skillful at fighting. She had also had professional training, and performed better than Hao Ran and his bros.Therefore, Gu Ning didn\u2019t defeat Chu Peihan immediately.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50However, after a few rounds, Chu Peihan apparently wasn\u2019t able to continue. She lost in 10 moves.Although she had lost, Chu Peihan didn\u2019t feel disappointed. Instead, she was more excited.If Gu Ning couldn\u2019t defeat her easily, it would be wrong to regard Gu Ning as her boss. Chu Peihan was happy that she had chosen the right person.At the same time, Chu Peihan had an idea. \u201cGu Ning, I\u2019m so eager to know who is better between you and my older brother. Could you have a try with my older brother some day?\u201d\u201cSure!\u201d Gu Ning agreed. She also wanted to have a try with someone who was as powerful as herself.Chu Peihan\u2019s older brother must be someone.Having Gu Ning\u2019s permission, Chu Peihan was looking forward to it even more, but her older brother wasn\u2019t in City F now. He would be back after a week.In the following training, Chu Peihan surprisingly found out that Gu Ning was very professional, just like her older brother.Meanwhile, she was more curious about Gu Ning. Was she really born in a poor single-parent family?Although she was curious, she had no intention to investigate Gu Ning, which would be disrespectful.Chu Peihan didn\u2019t care what secret Gu Ning had. She still believed that she had made a good friend.In the evening class, a boy stopped Gu Ning when she was on her way back to the classroom.He was around 1.8 meters tall and kind of good-looking, but wore a serious face.Nonetheless, Gu Ning knew he was using a serious look to cover his nervousness. He wasn\u2019t here for trouble.But, Gu Ning felt confused.\u00a0What was he doing here?The students, who sat under windows beside the passage, all looked over. They thought someone was here to cause Gu Ning trouble again. Shao Feifei and her friends were excited to see that.However, what happened next made their jaws drop.\u201cGu Ning, I like you. Would you like to go on a date with me?\u201d the boy asked.Hearing that, Gu Ning was struck dumb. She didn\u2019t expect the boy would say that he liked her.The crowd were all in shock.What? He liked her? Not for trouble?\u201cSorry,\u201d Gu Ning rejected.She didn\u2019t want to date now, and the boy wasn\u2019t her type either.Besides, Gu Ning was a 25-year-old mature woman mentally. She wasn\u2019t interested in teenage boys.\u201cWhy?\u201d the boy immediately inquired.\u201cNo specific reason,\u201d Gu Ning replied.The boy didn\u2019t know what to say all of a sudden. After a second, he said, \u201cWell, can we be friends then?\u201d\u201cIf we get along well, we\u2019ll be friends naturally, but for now, we\u2019re merely strangers. It\u2019s too early to say we\u2019re friends.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t reject, nor accept.The boy believed he still had hope, and was happy. \u201cGu Ning, it\u2019s so nice to meet you. I\u2019m An Yi from the sixth classroom. It\u2019s me who is being rude. I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll work hard to gain your approval!\u201d An Yi said with sincerity.The bell rang at that time and the evening class began. An Yi said good-bye to Gu Ning, then left.Gu Ning and Yu Mixi walked into their classroom at once.The minute Gu Ning stepped in, Shao Feifei\u2019s sight followed her all the way.Although she was terrified by Gu Ning and Hao Ran yesterday, she remained jealous as usual.It was hard for Shao Feifei to understand why Gu Ning had so many admirers. In her eyes, Gu Ning was just a little prettier than ordinary people, and wasn\u2019t a gorgeous beauty. Gu Ning was also from a poor family, and not good at studying either.But Mu Ke, the boy that Shao Feifei liked, called Gu Ning his boss. How could he do that!Shao Feifei\u2019s blood was boiling.She had to think of some way to beat Gu Ning.Those hoodlums had failed last time. Shao Feifei wouldn\u2019t make the same mistake twice.As for Gu Ning, she was used to Shao Feifei\u2019s unkind looks, and couldn\u2019t care less about it.After the evening class, Gu Ning went straight to the hospital.She ran for about half an hour to get there.At that time, there were few people in the hospital yard. It was quiet and a little ghastly.When Gu Ning got to the patient room, Gu Man told Gu Ning that Gu Qing had visited her today.Gu Man also told Gu Ning the reason why Gu Qing had come. She looked at Gu Ning with great care. She was worried Gu Ning would be sad.\u201cThe old lady is so cruel!\u201d Gu Ning sneered. She was mad, but not sad at all.Her anger wasn\u2019t from the old lady\u2019s cruelty to her, but to Gu Man. Gu Man was the old lady\u2019s biological daughter after all.Gu Ning always knew her grandmother liked sons over daughters, but she didn\u2019t expect the old lady would be so cold-blooded.And Gu Xiaoxiao was behind all of this.Gu Man signed resignedly. She was hurt deeper than Gu Ning.Even though Gu Ning had made mistakes, Gu Man would be mad or heart-broken, she would never hate her daughter, or even treat her badly. Gu Man would cherish her daughter more.Because\u2026Gu Man looked at Gu Ning, then gradually became absent-minded. She seemed sad and as if she was missing someone. Gu Ning knew Gu Man must be missing Gu Ning\u2019s biological father.Was the resemblance that great?There was no hatred in Gu Man\u2019s eyes. Obviously, she was still in love with him.Gu Ning was suddenly curious about her father.\u201cMom, could you tell me something about my father?\u201d Gu Ning asked.Gu Man was a little hesitated at first, then calmed down gradually.Ningning was 18 now. She couldn\u2019t keep it a secret from herself forever. She also didn\u2019t want Ningning to hate her biological father because of a misunderstanding.After a while, Gu Man opened her mouth. \u201cYour father was a handsome man. He was tall, strong, smart and talented, but he lost his memory back then, and he didn\u2019t even know who he was. I called him Ning afterwards. I\u2019d saved his life by accident. He was injured then. After that, we fell in love and stayed together. Your father was sophisticated. He became a supervisor after half a year in a company, then was promoted to be a manager of the planning department. However, an accident happened when he was on a business trip. The bus fell into the river. There were 23 people in the bus. Only five survived. 12 bodies were found. Six were missing, your father included.\u201dMissing amounted to death.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Gu Ning had believed the man had abandoned Gu Man, but the truth was totally different.Ning, that was the reason why Gu Man named her daughter Gu Ning!\u201cWhen I was with him, I felt the happiness I\u2019d never had. Thus, I thought of committing suicide after he had that accident. I knew it was selfish. It was unfair to my loving parents and my elder sister. When I was full of those tangled emotions, I found out that I\u2019d been pregnant for three months. Therefore, I continued my life and dropped out of the school.\u201dWhat had happened next wasn\u2019t a secret to Gu Ning.Gu Man\u2019s mother thought it was humiliating that Gu Man was pregnant before getting married. She had asked Gu Man to have an abortion, or she wouldn\u2019t admit that Gu Man was her daughter.Gu Man had chosen her child over her mother, thus she had left her home. She had then used money from her father to rent a house and try to find jobs.But she had been refused because of her pregnancy.After a few months, she had run out of money. Gu Man had to turn to Gu Qing for help afterwards.After Gu Man and left her home, her father and Gu Qing had searched for her in vain. It had been Gu Man who had turned to Gu Qing on her own initiative.Gu Man\u2019s father then picked Gu Man up and took her back home. Under her father\u2019s protection, Gu Man had successfully given birth to Gu Ning.Eighteen years later, the old sadness was already gone, but Gu Man still felt unhappy every time she thought of those memories.The next day, Gu Ning got up early as usual. She ran to school then continued to run with her friends. She didn\u2019t go back to her school until it was five minutes before the morning class.There weren\u2019t bathrooms in their school, so they couldn\u2019t take a bath even though they were all wet from that sweat.Luckily, they would take a shower when they went back home and they weren\u2019t smelly.\u201cBoss, today\u2019s Friday. Let\u2019s go have some fun in our club tonight!\u201d Hao Ran said on the way back to their classrooms.\u201cI like it. Gu Ning, go with us!\u201d Chu Peihan said with excitement.\u201cYeah! It\u2019s our place. It\u2019s safe,\u201d Qin Zixun said.\u201cWe have a new kind of fruit drink. Girls love it! Boss, why not have a try?\u201d Zhang Tianping added.\u201cI need to go to City G this afternoon, sorry,\u201d Gu Ning replied.The crowd immediately felt disappointed.\u201cWhy are you going to City G?\u201d Chu Peihan asked.\u201cTo deal with something,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSomething about what?\u201d Hao Ran inquired.\u201cThat\u2019s a secret,\u201d Gu Ning answered.Hearing that, they all felt bored, but since Gu Ning wasn\u2019t willing to tell, they stopped asking.\u201cBut, I\u2019ll buy gifts for you all,\u201d Gu Ning added.Knowing that, everyone was delighted again.\u201cSounds great!\u201dAlthough they all knew Gu Ning was from a poor family, they didn\u2019t reject her kindness because they believed Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t buy something expensive.Gifts showed affection and didn\u2019t need to be expensive.\u201cIf you\u2019re not staying in the hospital these two days, should we go visit your mother?\u201d Mu Ke asked with care.\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. An Qian will be there,\u201d Gu Ning said.Gu Ning absolutely wouldn\u2019t allow them to visit her mother, because she had lied to Gu Man, saying that she was going to City G with Mu Ke. If they went to visit Gu Man, Gu Man would know the truth.At noon, Gu Ning received a message from Qin Zheng. Qin Zheng invited her to have a talk.Gu Ning didn\u2019t think there was any need to talk with Qin Zheng. She had forgiven Qin Zheng about the car accident, and that was the best she could do.If Qin Zheng stayed away from her afterwards, then everything would be fine. If he still came to bother her, she wouldn\u2019t be kind to him.Gu Ning directly blocked Qin Zheng\u2019s number.Qin Zheng didn\u2019t get Gu Ning\u2019s answer and was displeased. He stopped sending messages to Gu Ning because he was mad.Recently, Qin Zheng always had Gu Ning in his mind. He couldn\u2019t tell what his feelings for Gu Ning were now himself.When he heard Gu Ning and her mother had been kicked out by her grandmother because of Gu Xiaoxiao, he wanted to help.But Gu Ning ignored his message.Gu Xiaoxiao stayed away from Gu Ning today.She wanted to laugh at Gu Ning, but she was afraid that Gu Ning would beat her again.Shao Feifei also kept a distance from Gu Ning today, except for her unkind looks.Gu Ning had a peaceful day today. She had already prepared everything she needed, so she took a taxi, heading to the airport directly after the afternoon classes were over.She had a backpack with her, and put all the documents inside her Jade Eyes. There was only a change of clothes in her backpack. She wanted to change when she arrived at the airport, because she couldn\u2019t go to City G in her school uniform.It was the rush hour, and the roads were crowded downtown. When the car left downtown, it moved fast again.Gu Ning left her school at 5:50 pm and her plane would fly at 7:30. It took around 40 minutes to get to the airport. When Gu Ning arrived, it was already 6:40 pm.50 minutes were left, so Gu Ning wasn\u2019t in a hurry. She went to a washroom and changed her clothes.Jean shorts, a loose white T-shirt and a pair of white sneakers. Gu Ning pulled up her hair, and looked energetic and attractive.Plus her flawless skin and her beautiful face. She was literally charming and shining. People around her would give her glances once in a while.Gu Ning didn\u2019t have time to buy new clothes, so she was wearing her old clothing.Luckily, Gu Man always treated Gu Ning well. Sometimes, Gu Man would buy some clothes of good quality to Gu Ning, like the outfit Gu Ning was wearing today. It wasn\u2019t expensive, but cost around a hundred yuan.Gu Ning stood in line to take her ticket, then she was in the lounge.In the lounge, Gu Ning still had half an hour. It wasn\u2019t enough time for a meal, so Gu Ning planned to have a cup of coffee.Coincidentally, the minute Gu Ning walked in the caf\u00e9, she saw Qin Yifan with a young, beautiful lady.\u201cGu Ning, what a coincidence! Where are you going?\u201d Qin Yifan beamed when Gu Ning appeared in his sight. He stood up in excitement, greeting Gu Ning.The lady beside Qin Yifan was a little unhappy. She checked Gu Ning out with an unkind look. She was jealous, especially when she found out Gu Ning had a charming appearance.Gu Ning had an acute mind. She immediately felt the unkindness from the lady, but she ignored it.\u201cHi. What a coincidence! I\u2019m going to City G. How about you?\u201d Gu Ning planned to have a good relationship with Qin Yifan, so she was friendly towards him.Of course, Gu Ning had no intention to disguise it.\u201cWow, I\u2019m flying to City G too! My plane will be leaving at 7:30 pm, and you?\u201d Knowing Gu Ning was heading to City G, Qin Yifan was even more excited now. Others might even believe he liked Gu Ning.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52But for now, Qin Yifan only appreciated Gu Ning. There weren\u2019t many people whom Qin Yifan thought highly of, so he was excited when he met Gu Ning again.\u201cMe too.\u201d Gu Ning smiled.\u201cWhat a great coincidence! Come over here, we can take the plane together later,\u201d Qin Yifan invited her with passion.Gu Ning didn\u2019t reject. She followed Qin Yifan to his seat.Qin Yifan pulled out the chair for Gu Ning like a gentleman. The young lady seemed upset once more.\u201cWhat would you like to drink?\u201d Qin Yifan asked.\u201cCoffee please,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Qin Yifan called the waiter, and ordered a cup of coffee for Gu Ning.\u201cYifan, you haven\u2019t introduced the girl to me yet.\u201d the lady who sat aside opened her mouth. She called Qin Yifan in a deliberately intimate way.Then, Qin Yifan immediately turned to the lady. \u201cThis is my friend, Gu Ning.\u201d\u201cGu Ning, this is my uncle\u2019s daughter, Li Zhenzhen,\u201d he said to Gu Ning.\u201cNice to meet you, miss Li.\u201d Although Gu Ning knew Li Zhenzhen disliked her, she greeted her politely since Li Zhenzhen didn\u2019t actually hurt her yet.\u201cNice to meet you too, miss Gu,\u201d Li Zhenzhen replied. She hadn\u2019t figured out the relations between Gu Ning and Qin Yifan, and didn\u2019t want to be rude.After that, Li Zhenzhen looked at Qin Yifan. \u201cI think miss Gu is around 18 years old, right? Yifan, I\u2019m curious how did you meet miss Gu?\u201d\u201cI told you this afternoon. I bought a King\u2019s Green in the size of a quail\u2019s egg from a female student. The female student is Gu Ning,\u201d Qin Yifan said. Saying that, Qin Yifan couldn\u2019t help but show his appreciation of Gu Ning.\u201cOh, that!\u201d Knowing that, Li Zhenzhen was surprised. At the same time, she was upset, because she clearly saw Qin Yifan\u2019s appreciation of the female student.She liked Qin Yifan, and had even told him plainly several times, but Qin Yifan explained that he only regarded her as his sister.When Qin Yifan was with her, he always seemed serious. However, when he was with the female student, Gu Ning, he behaved so passionately. Li Zhenzhen was jealous.\u201cOh, Gu Ning, what are you going to do in City G?\u201d Qin Yifan asked.\u201cJust for a trip,\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cWhere are you going to stay?\u201d Qin Yifan asked with care.\u201cI\u2019ll stay in the Huangdeng Hotel in downtown,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Huangdeng Hotel was a five-star luxury hotel in City G. It cost hundreds of yuan to stay there for a night, but Gu Ning chose to stay there for a reason.The hotel would arrange a free tailored car for its customers all day.In an unfamiliar city, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t willing to rent a car, nor wait for a taxi. It was much more convenient to have a full-time chauffeur.Besides, she didn\u2019t lack money now.\u201cGreat, I\u2019ll pass by the Huangdeng Hotel later. Do you need a lift?\u201d Qin Yifan said.\u201cYifan\u2026\u201d Hearing that, Li Zhenzhen was more displeased now. They wouldn\u2019t pass by the Huangdeng Hotel at all. Actually the Huangdeng Hotel was far away from their destination!It would be late at night when they arrived at City G. If they were going to the Huangdeng Hotel before going back home, they would have to waste more time on the road.Li Zhenzhen actually didn\u2019t care about the time. She simple disliked Gu Ning. If Gu Ning had been one of Qin Yifan\u2019s male friends, she wouldn\u2019t care at all.But before Li Zhenzhen could say another word, Qin Yifan stopped her with a glance. Li Zhenzhen was a little mad now but she closed her mouth, because she didn\u2019t want to ruin her elegant appearance.Gu Ning obviously knew what was going on here. Even though it was convenient for Qin Yifan to give her a ride, Gu Ning had no intention to let him do that. Thus she refused, \u201cThank you so much, but the hotel will pick me up.\u201d\u201cWell, fine.\u201d If Gu Ning had said she would take a taxi, Qin Yifan would have insisted on driving her to the hotel, but since the hotel would pick her up, he didn\u2019t insist.\u201cWhen will you be going back? If you have time, you can ask me out. I can take you for a tour since I\u2019m free all day,\u201d Qin Yifan said with delight. He totally forgot he was going to City G to deal with some business.Li Zhenzhen was eager to interrupt, but Gu Ning opened her mouth first. \u201cI\u2019m going to deal with something there, and I\u2019ll be back the day after tomorrow.\u201dWhich meant she didn\u2019t have time.Before long, their plane was about to take off. Gu Ning\u2019s and Qin Yifan\u2019s seat were all in the first class. Li Zhenzhen felt extremely unhappy.As long as Gu Ning was present, Qin Yifan would talk to her and ignore Li Zhenzhen.Gu Ning had actually wanted to buy a ticket in economy class, but the economy class was all booked. Gu Ning then had to buy a ticket in the first class.Qin Yifan, Li Zhenzhen and Gu Ning all sat on the second row. Gu Ning sat beside the aisle. Qin Yifan\u2019s seat was beside the window, but he exchanged with Li Zhenzhen to sit next to Gu Ning.Li Zhenzhen was annoyed. If not for her appearance, she would probably argue with Qin Yifan now.Gu Ning actually didn\u2019t want to talk much with Qin Yifan, especially in front of Li Zhenzhen. She didn\u2019t want to cause any misunderstandings or trouble.Therefore, when the plane moved up high to the sky, Gu Ning closed her eyes to have a rest.Qin Yifan didn\u2019t bother Gu Ning anymore.Gu Ning didn\u2019t close her eyes all the way, because it wouldn\u2019t be natural.An hour later, the plane landed at the airport of City G. Gu Ning and Qin Yifan walked out of the airport then separated.Gu Ning found the car from the hotel. She got in and headed straight to the hotel.When she arrived at the hotel, it was already 9:40 pm. She checked in, walking upstairs directly.The minute Gu Ning stepped in the right elevator, the left elevator opened, and several men walked out.The front man was Leng Shaoting.Gu Ning missed Leng Shaoting by seconds.It wasn\u2019t a big deal after all. They were merely strangers who had only met each other twice.But it was still Gu Ning\u2019s destiny to meet the man again.Gu Ning went to her room and called Gu Man to tell her mother she was safe.In case Gu Man would ask to talk with Mu Ke or Yu Mixi, Gu Ning hung up after a short time. She used an excuse that she needed to review some documents.Gu Ning indeed was going to read documents. She hadn\u2019t read the books about emeralds and jade yet! She wanted to make full use of her time, and read those books now.But before that, Gu Ning used her WeChat, sending out a message to the \u201cFamily of Fighters\u201d group to tell her friends that she had safely arrived.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53There were thousands of chat messages above, which shocked Gu Ning.These people were so talkative!Gu Ning read those messages. Some asked whether she had arrived at City G, while some were curious why she was in City G.One said she was here to visit relatives, while one said she was here to meet a friend or a blind date. Gu Ning felt like laughing.Gu Ning: \u201cI\u2019m in my hotel now, safe and sound.\u201dHao Ran: \u201cWow, boss is here.\u201dChu Peihan: \u201cBoss, don\u2019t forget our gifts!\u201d [Gift emoji]Mu Ke: \u201cDon\u2019t forget our gifts!\u201d [Gift emoji]Qin Zixun: \u201cDon\u2019t forget our gifts!\u201d [Gift emoji]Zhang Tianping: \u201cDon\u2019t forget our gifts!\u201d [Gift emoji]Yu Mixi: \u201cDon\u2019t forget our gifts!\u201d [Gift emoji]Gu Ning laughed out loud. These people were so adorable!She hadn\u2019t decided what she would bring back to them as gifts yet.Gu Ning: \u201cI won\u2019t forget. It\u2019s late now. I need to go to bed. Tomorrow is a busy day!\u201dChu Peihan: \u201cFine, I\u2019m more and more curious about what you\u2019re up to now.\u201dHao Ran: \u201cExactly, boss, are you going to live in the lap of luxury without us?\u201dMu Ke: \u201cNonsense, Hao Ran, you\u2019re already living in the lap of luxury.\u201d [Kick out emoji]Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping: \u201cAgree!\u201d [Kick out emoji]Hao Ran: \u201cYou all bully me.\u201d [Cry emoji]Hao Ran: \u201cBoss, I need your care.\u201d [Pitiful face emoji]Gu Ning: \u201cGet out.\u201d [Kick out emoji]Everyone: \u201cLOL.\u201d [Laughing out loud emoji]Hao Ran: \u201cYou people!

Good night.\u201dYu Mixi: \u201cGood night, Ningning.\u201dEveryone: \u201cGood night, boss.\u201dAfter the talk, Gu Ning started to read.Stone gambling was also called object gambling. It meant that when the jade was mined, there was a layer of weathered\u00a0leather\u00a01\u00a0wrapped around it. It was impossible to know the quality of it. It must be cut to know the quality of the jade.The original stones of jade were divided into two types, namely mountain material and seed material. As the name implied, the mountain material referred to the material from mountains. It had no outer skin and was a jade itself. However, most of the jade was poor in quality.The seed material was the raw material of stone gambling that people often referred to. The seed material was formed in the riverbed. The surface of the seed material was weathered, so the outer shell was formed. Thus the inner condition couldn\u2019t be seen. One could only rely on his experience to judge whether the inner part had formed an emerald. Those seeds were called raw materials or raw stones.The most profitable, most tempting, but also the most risky bet would be stone gambling.There was a saying in the jewelry industry: Stone gambling was like life gambling. The winner could earn ten times or hundreds time more money, and became a millionaire overnight, while the loser could lose everything. Compared with stone gambling, stocks, real estate and other risky trades all seemed mild and gentle.The buying and selling of the original stones of jade was the most mysterious trade in the jewellery industry. Its mystery lay in the word \u201cgambling\u201d. Therefore, the buyers always called it jade gambling or stone gambling.Generally, one couldn\u2019t tell what was in a stone from its appearance. Even with the technological advances today, there was no instrument which could quickly determine whether a stone was valuable or valueless through its shell. Therefore, the risk of buying and selling stones was very high, and it was also very exciting. Thus it was called \u201cgambling\u201d and was quite profitable if one won. Accordingly, this business had been going on since ancient times.The jade used to gamble was also divided into different classes, mainly depending on the type, color and transparency.Again, the quality of the jade mainly relied on three points: type, color and transparency.The type referred to the variety of jade. Jade from a good type was hard.The types from high to low levels were old pit glass, ice, hail, bean, oil green, hibiscus, gold, and so on.The type of the jade was of great importance..Color referred to the colors of jade. There were many colors of jade, but the best jade was mainly bright green.The colors from high to low levels were green (king\u2019s green, bright green, apple green), red, yellow and purple.The production of jade in special color was relatively small. The color of jade must be combined with great transparency, and it must be less cracked in order to be priceless.Transparency was the ability of the jade to let the visible light pass through.The jade with a higher transparency was more valuable. The best jade was like glass, and was called \u201cGlass Bottom\u201d in the jade industry.After understanding the stone gambling, Gu Ning turned to the computer to learn about the domestic jewellery brand\u2019s history, development, fame, reputation, founders and its chairman.Regardless of whether it was the first, second or third, or not on the line, Gu Ning has read it all over.But the time was limited, so Gu Ning didn\u2019t check the foreign brands now. Besides, Gu Ning hadn\u2019t developed so fast. She wanted to be influential, but she also knew to take it slowly.\u2026The next day, Gu Ning got up at seven am. She called for breakfast first, then brushed her teeth and washed her face.30 minutes later, her breakfast arrived.Gu Ning wasn\u2019t in a hurry, because it was too early so the stores weren\u2019t open yet.At half past eight, Gu Ning called the reception and ordered a tailored car.The hotel was efficient. When Gu Ning went down to the first floor, her tailored car was waiting for her.Antiques and stone gambling were always together. So Gu Ning told the driver to take her to the antique market.It wasn\u2019t far from downtown to the antique market. She would arrive there after 40 minutes, if there was no traffic jam.On her way, Gu Ning took out her phone. Her friends were talking in the \u201cFamily of Fighters\u201d group again.But Gu Ning didn\u2019t get involved in their talk. She took a glance, then put her phone away.When she arrived at the antique market, it was slightly past nine. The antique market was already active.Gu Ning knew she would spend a lot of time in the antique market. She would not make the driver wait for her for so long. So she told the driver to leave first, and she would call him when she needed to go back.The minute Gu Ning walked into the antique market, she became excited and nervous.The antique market in City G was much bigger that the one in City F. The objects were also in a larger number.The power of Gu Ning\u2019s Jade Eyes was thin now, so she decided to take a look at stones first. She wanted to absorb the power.Antiques and stone gambling were set separately on the two sides of the street. Following the sign, Gu Ning walked towards the street of stone gambling.The nearer Gu Ning was to the street of stone gambling, the more excited she got, just like there was a large amount of thick power and money waiting for her ahead.The market of stone gambling in City G wasn\u2019t very big. There were only around 10 shops, but people were everywhere.Gu Ning walked into the first shop. It wasn\u2019t big, and was around 40 square meters. There were piles of large and small stones on the ground and the platform.Those were raw materials of stones.These raw materials had already been selected by the boss, and were stacked in equal order. All marked with a price.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54On the ground were raw materials of a low level, while on the shelves were raw materials of a high level.Raw materials could be sold by number or weight.The price of a raw material didn\u2019t rely on its size. From a professional point of view, if the skin was good and the green rate was high, it would be marked as a higher level, and was more expensive.Of course, the higher level didn\u2019t equal to a high green rate. After all, it was extremely difficult to choose the right raw material with jade in it. No one knew whether there was an emerald in a raw material.Therefore, even if it was a raw material of a low level it was possible there was an emerald in it.It all depended on one\u2019s luck.There were many people in the store, and no one came to welcome Gu Ning. Gu Ning liked that though. She wasn\u2019t willing to shop with a salesman who kept talking beside her ears.Gu Ning immediately used her Jade Eyes to scan over those raw materials. She checked those on the shelves first. They were supposed to be in the high level with high green rate. However disappointedly, they were mostly white stones.Although there were some jade in them, the jade wasn\u2019t of good quality. It wasn\u2019t worth much even if you cut it out. Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to waste her time on it.Then, Gu Ning turned to the raw materials on the ground. They were all white stones again.It seemed a pair of Jade Eyes wasn\u2019t enough. Gu Ning also needed good luck!She stepped out of this shop with disappointment then entered another one.The result was the same. The raw materials were either white stones, or with bad jade in them.The power in Gu Ning\u2019s Jade Eyes was thin, so she felt tired after a short time. She prayed in her heart, hoping to find jade soon. Otherwise her power would be completely consumed soon. Without the power, she couldn\u2019t use her telepathic eyes.It seemed the God had heard Gu Ning\u2019s pray. When Gu Ning was about to close her Jade Eyes she found two raw materials with green jade in them among a pile of raw materials.One was almost as big as a football, while the other was merely bigger than an apple.Both of them were of good quality.Gu Ning felt excited, but remained calm. She walked like an ordinary customer to the pile of raw materials. With a cart, Gu Ning picked up those two raw materials with green jade in them.To avoid special attention, Gu Ning also picked up another three raw materials in different size. They were all smaller than a football.\u201cHey, how much are these in total?\u201d Gu Ning pushed the cart to the counter.The boss was a little surprised to see Gu Ning, who was a teenage girl, but since she was a customer, the boss treated her kindly.There were marks on the raw materials, so the boss didn\u2019t need to ask where Gu Ning had picked those raw materials up.Those raw materials were all of a low level, and weren\u2019t expensive. 200 yuan a pound.Those five raw materials that Gu Ning had picked up weren\u2019t big. They added up to 40 pounds and cost 8,000 yuan.Eight thousand weren\u2019t much as long as there were emeralds in those raw materials. If they were all stones, eight thousand would be too much.Gu Ning paid her bill. The boss asked, \u201cMiss, do you want to cut them out now?\u201d\u201cYes, please,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Gu Ning was here for money. She definitely wanted to cut the raw materials on site, and sell to the emeralds right away.\u201cLao Zhang, come and cut the stones out,\u201d the boss called someone inside the room.\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d A man, who was around 50 years old, walked out from the room. He came to the counter, seeing Gu Ning. He was surprised that the customer was a young teenager.Lao Zhang asked with uncertainty, \u201cMiss, it\u2019s you who wants to cut the stones out, right?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cPlease follow me.\u201d Lao Zhang then guided Gu Ning towards the area where they cut stones.Meanwhile, those customers in the shop all stood around them to have a look.Although there was a faint, almost zero, possibility to get jade out, it was the exciting point of stone gambling. Even if it was impossible to get jade out, the gambler would stay hopeful.Everyone who enjoyed stone gambling shared the same feelings.And the crowd was surprised the owner of those raw materials was a young girl.Most customers here were middle-aged men or the elderly. There were few young people, especially young girls around.Gu Ning handed the worker a waste material first. The worker asked her, \u201cMiss, how would you like to cut it? Rub or cut?\u201d\u201cCut, please,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cCut it directly, or draw lines first?\u201d the worker asked again. Although he could tell this one must be a waste material, he needed to follow the customer\u2019s order.\u201cCut it directly, please.\u201d It was a waste material. Gu Ning didn\u2019t care at all.Cutting a stone directly didn\u2019t mean to cut it randomly. The worker still needed to have a good judgment.The machine started to work. After one cut, it was nothing but a white stone. After another cut, there was still nothing in it. After the third cut, the stone had already been cut half out. Nothing in it. It was waste.The crowd felt disappointed after the result.But if there really was jade in it, the crowd would be envious.That was human nature.Gu Ning calmly picked up another waste material. It also proved to be a pure stone. The crowd began to feel bored. Some walked away.The third time, Gu Ning chose a big raw material with jade in it.\u201cLet me draw lines first,\u201d Gu Ning said, then drew some lines on it.She didn\u2019t draw the lines accurately, but basically the same.The machine started to work again. After one cut, the out layer was removed. There was a light green color open to the air.All of a sudden, Gu Ning sensed a kind of strong power. She was excited, and couldn\u2019t wait to absorb it.The power was absorbed into her eyes. She felt cool and comfortable. Her sight became better and she was energetic now.At the same time, the worker raised his voice in excitement, \u201cThe jade! There is jade in it!\u201dHis voice immediately attracted everyone\u2019s attention in the shop.The people in front of them were all surprised and wide-eyed. It was so incredible! Those who had just left immediately turned back, and some who just entered the store, all came up.\u201cWhat? There is jade in it?\u201d\u201cYes, there is jade in it!\u201dThe onlookers seemed more excited than Gu Ning, who was the owner, because stone gambling was a high-risk business, and the green rate was always low.Most of the onlookers knew Gu Ning was the owner. They all looked to Gu Ning with envy, but Gu Ning stayed calm as usual.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55The crowd all wondered whether this teenage girl understood stone gambling, or if she simply didn\u2019t care at all.\u201cYoung lady, would you sell this raw material to me for fifty thousand yuan. Although there is a little light green color showing out, who knows if there is more inside, right? If there is no more inside, then it\u2019ll be waste. If you sell it now, you can earn fifty thousand yuan anyway. If you don\u2019t sell it, you\u2019ll have nothing,\u201d a middle-aged man in a suit, who was a little fat and about 50 years old said.If the raw material which was cut open had green in it, the cut was called a \u201cwindow\u201d. If the owner didn\u2019t want to gamble any further, he or she could sell it.The buyer was also gambling of course, because a light layer of green didn\u2019t mean the raw material would be valuable.There was often only one thin layer of green in many raw materials, or the jade inside was very small.But a raw material with a \u201cwindow\u201d was much more expensive than a raw material without a \u201cwindow\u201d, like the one Gu Ning had bought for two thousand yuan and the man later bid fifty thousand yuan for it.The raw material showed green after all. It was possible that there was jade in it.If the green layer was thin, it would be waste. If there was jade in it, it would be worth a certain amount of money according to the size of the jade.The middle-aged man was simply trying to deceive Gu Ning. In his eyes, Gu Ning was merely a teenager and must know nothing about stone gambling.Even if there wasn\u2019t jade in the raw material, he could afford fifty thousand yuan.But if there was jade inside, he could make a lot of money.Although Gu Ning didn\u2019t know much about stone gambling, she knew the jade in the stone must be extremely valuable. fifty thousand yuan couldn\u2019t buy one percent of it.\u201cI\u2019ll stay and gamble till the jade is all out. The most generous buyer will get it,\u201d Gu Ning said.The man was disappointed, but he couldn\u2019t do anything about it.The worker continued to cut. After the second cut, there was another layer of green shown, and the type of the jade was revealed.\u201cIt\u2019s valuable!\u201d the worker said in excitement.\u201cThe color is a little yellow. The quality is good. This is of the glutinous rice type,\u201d the boss came over, and was also thrilled.\u201cYoung lady, could you sell it to me in five hundred thousand yuan?\u201d the middle-aged man bid again.\u201cI\u2019ll pay eight hundred thousand yuan for it.\u201d\u201cOne million yuan.\u201d\u2026\u201cTwo million yuan!\u201dWhen the price rose up to two million yuan, no one else bid again. The jade hadn\u2019t been fully cut out. It was still uncertain how big it was and how much it was worth.Gu Ning didn\u2019t stop them from bidding. After they finished, Gu Ning opened her mouth. \u201cI will sell it when the jade is fully cut out.\u201dThe jade must be worth more than two million yuan.The worker then went on to cut the stone.He removed the out layer first, then started to rub it.Half an hour later, a jade which was as big as half a football was finally cut out.The glutinous rice type was jade of a high level. It was absolutely worth a lot.Moreover, its size wasn\u2019t small.\u201cFive million yuan.\u201d\u201cSix million yuan.\u201d\u201cSeven million yuan.\u201d\u201cTen million yuan!\u201d a bright voice sounded. The bidder directly omitted the three million gap.An energetic old man of 70 years old walked inside.\u201cOh, Master Fu, it\u2019s been a while! Nice to meet you again!\u201d a man immediately greeted.\u201cAt the beginning of the month, my great-grandson was born. I\u2019ve stayed at home for a long time, but it was uncomfortable to stay at home for too long. Thus I wanted to take a look around. Unexpectedly, I arrived on time when the top grade jade was cut out. I wanted to buy it and make a gift for my great-grandson!\u201d Master Fu said.Master Fu was mainly engaged in real estate business, and many other industries. He was a very rich businessman with eight billion yuan of wealth. His family was one of the third-tier richest families in a second-tier city like G City.Although the super rich families could be divided into the first-tier, second-tier and third-tier, there were only 10 of them in all.Because only the top 10 richest people were able to be called the super rich.And Master Fu was in the top seven on the list.Of course, in addition to those super rich people on the list, there were also many invisible super rich families.\u201cIt seems Master Fu is very interested in the jade of glutinous rice type, but I like it too. I\u2019m afraid I have to compete with you, Master Fu,\u201d another man said. \u201cEleven million yuan.\u201dAlthough the man wasn\u2019t as wealthy as Master Fu, he bid a very high price for the jade.\u201cThe most generous buyer will get the jade. Then, let\u2019s compete for it. Fifteen million yuan.\u201d Master Fu directly raised his bid by four million.\u201cSixteen million yuan.\u201d\u201cSeventeen million yuan.\u201d\u201cEighteen million yuan.\u201d\u2026\u201cThirty million yuan!\u201dThe bid now was thirty million yuan. Master Fu had made it.Thirty million yuan was almost the highest price of the jade. The buyer wouldn\u2019t lose money, but couldn\u2019t earn much either.The boss of the shop had mixed emotions. He was excited and regretful at the same time.Why?He was excited because someone had cut out jade from a raw material in his shop. That was great advertisement. His shop would be popular then.Meanwhile, he was regretful that he himself didn\u2019t know the raw material was worth a fortune. If he had known the raw material was so valuable, he would have cut it out himself.But the boss still understood that was how the industry of stone gambling worked. He was mentally prepared.Besides, it had happened before, so he soon accepted the reality.The man didn\u2019t expect Master Fu would bid such a high price for the jade. He had to give up at the end. \u201cMaster Fu, you win.\u201dHe didn\u2019t want to pay thirty million yuan for the jade.He was a businessman after all. He wanted to benefit from the deal, instead of losing money.\u201cHa-ha, Xiao Zhao, don\u2019t worry. Perhaps there is something better waiting for you!\u201d Master Fu comforted the man. Unexpectedly, what Master Fu had said became the truth later.Yes, the next jade in a smaller size was worth more than the previous one.\u201cThank you, Master Fu.\u201d The man smiled with sadness. He knew it wasn\u2019t easy to get an emerald of top quality.\u201cWho is the owner of this jade?\u201d Master Fu asked.Gu Ning knew this jade of the glutinous rice type was a high-level jade. Even though it was far less valuable than the King\u2019s Green, it was still very valuable. Gu Ning estimated it was worth about thirty million yuan, but when she really heard the bid of thirty million yuan, she was still shocked. She couldn\u2019t believe it was real.Gu Ning didn\u2019t get her mind back until Master Fu asked the question. She immediately replied calmly, \u201cNice to meet you, Master Fu. This jade is mine.\u201dSeeing it was a young girl, Master Fu was also surprised, especially since the price rose up to thirty million yuan. Gu Ning could remain so calm.She was able to stay as calm as always at such a young age.Master Fu had a good impression of Gu Ning.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56\u201cGood girl,\u201d Master Fu complimented. \u201cDo you want a check or transfer?\u201d\u201cTransfer please,\u201d Gu Ning said. She took out her bank card and told Master Fu her account.\u201cSure,\u201d Master Fu answered. He called someone to transfer the money right away.After a few minutes, Gu Ning received a message, which showed the 30 million yuan had been successfully transferred. Then, Gu Ning handed the jade to Master Fu.\u201cMiss, do you want to cut the rest?\u201d the worker inquired.\u201cYes, please,\u201d Gu Ning answered. She gave a waste material to the worker.Master Fu was about to leave with the jade, but he stayed when Gu Ning continued to cut her raw materials.Since Gu Ning had already cut out a high-level emerald, the crowd was excited to see what would happen next.Although they all believed Gu Ning couldn\u2019t be so lucky as to cut out another jade, they were still full of hope.Unfortunately, the next one was a waste material. However, the crowd didn\u2019t disperse yet, because Gu Ning had one last raw material.Gu Ning hadn\u2019t successfully gotten an emerald until the third raw material of hers had been cut out. It could be possible that the last raw material had jade in it too.Still, there wasn\u2019t a strong possibility.The last one wasn\u2019t big. Gu Ning also knew the out layer wasn\u2019t thick, so she said, \u201cPlease rub this one.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d the worker replied.It took a while longer to rub a stone than cut it, but everyone was patient.After a while, green showed on the stone. The worker raised his voice in excitement firstly, \u201cThere is an emerald, again!\u201d\u201cGee, the girl is so lucky! Two in five have jade inside.\u201dThis time, the boss felt greatly regretful.There was only a little green that showed. It was hard to tell the type.The worker went on to rub the stone. The more the outer layer was removed, the more excited everyone got.When most of the outer layer had been removed, the type of the jade was clear enough.\u201cJesus! Isn\u2019t it of the high-ice type!\u201dHigh-ice types were only a little worse than glass type, but they were also a type of high-level jade. It was even better than the glutinous rice type.This emerald was crystal clear with great transparency. It belonged to the old pit, high-ice type. Although it wasn\u2019t big, and only as big as one-third of the previous jade of glutinous rice type, its price wasn\u2019t much lower than the previous one.Gu Ning immediately absorbed the power into her Jade Eyes.As long as her telepathic eye space was full of the power, it would grow bigger.When the jade was fully cut out, a man bid at once, \u201cTwenty million yuan!\u201dIt was Master Fu\u2019s voice again. No one dared to follow up this time, because there were few rich people around.The man who had competed with Master Fu last time now was about to cry. He said, \u201cMaster Fu, didn\u2019t you say there is something better waiting for me? Why do you have to compete with me again this time? I\u2019ll pay twenty-five million yuan for it!\u201dThis jade of the high-ice type was more valuable than the last one of glutinous rice type indeed, but it wasn\u2019t big. It was worth around twenty-five million yuan. If it was made into jewelry, the buyer could earn about ten million yuan from it.But if the bid went higher, it wouldn\u2019t be very profitable.Master Fu, instead, was determined to buy the jade. \u201cThe most generous buyer will have the jade. I think it\u2019s pretty fair.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d the man didn\u2019t know what to do. If Master Fu bid again, he had to give up once more.\u201cFine, this one is yours.\u201d Master Fu understood the man, whose name was Zhao Yuefeng, wanted the jade so badly. They were acquaintances actually. Master Fu didn\u2019t want to lose a friend just because of an emerald.Zhao Yuefeng was thrilled at once. \u201cThank you so much, Master Fu!\u201dThus, Zhao Yuefeng got this jade of high-ice type at the price of twenty-five million yuan in the end.Within a day, Gu Ning made fifty-five million yuan.Although Gu Ning seemed calm from her appearance, her heart was pumping faster and faster.She would scream out if allowed now.\u201cMiss Gu, it\u2019s so nice to meet you. I am the chairman of Furong Jewelry,\u201d called Zhao Yuefeng. \u201cThis is my business card. If Miss Gu cuts out any other high-level jade again, please let me know. I can buy it at a reasonable price, and please give me priority as a buyer.\u201d Zhao Yuefeng was now fully convinced by Gu Ning. Whether it was because of luck or real strength, it was truly rare to cut out two high-level emeralds from five raw materials.Gu Ning had checked up on the domestic jewelry brands, their founders and chairmen online last night, so she naturally knew about the Furong jewellery brand.The headquarters of Furong Jewelry wasn\u2019t in City G, but it had many stores across the country with two billion yuan in assets. It belonged to the domestic third-line brand, and the chairman was Zhao Yuefeng who was about 40 years old.Zhao Yuefeng didn\u2019t need to buy in jade himself. He was just here for fun when he was inspecting his stores in City G.Gu Ning was excited that Zhao Yuefeng made friends with her on his own initiative.Therefore, if she was going to cut out more jade, she would sell some to Zhao Yuefeng.They would be peers. Although peers always competed with each other, they could also cooperate.Gu Ning accepted his name card with happiness. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll call Mr Zhao first if I cut out any high-level jade in the future.\u201d\u201cYoung girl, please don\u2019t forget me. You can contact me too. I won\u2019t pay less than Zhao Yuefeng.\u201d Master Fu took out his name card immediately, putting it straight into Gu Ning\u2019s hand. Gu Ning thought it was so funny to see those two buyers competing.Although Gu Ning didn\u2019t know Master Fu\u2019s background now, she knew the old man must be wealthy and powerful.Gu Ning didn\u2019t aim at the old man\u2019s wealth of course.She just wanted to maintain a good relationship with her clients, especially super rich clients.\u201cMaster Fu, you do this on purpose, right?\u201d Zhao Yuefeng felt a little displeased.\u201cSo what? You\u2019re not the only one who loves jade. I love it too!\u201d Master Fu argued back like a child, \u201cYoung girl, do remember me!\u201d he kindly reminded Gu Ning then.\u201cI will.\u201d Gu Ning smiled.She was going to cut out many more emeralds in the future. It wouldn\u2019t hurt anyone if she sold some to Master Fu as well.Master Fu was happy to hear an affirmative answer.After that, Gu Ning left the shop first.Before long, many people had heard the news that the shop had cut out two high-level jade. People all came to the shop for good luck. The shop became popular at once.Unfortunately, they weren\u2019t as lucky as Gu Ning.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57Gu Ning left the shop, then walked in another one. She luckily found another high-level jade and a medium-level jade.The high-level jade was as big as an apple, while the medium-level jade was a little bigger, and the size of half a football.Gu Ning did not plan to cut the high-level jade out now. She had just cut out two high-level emeralds, and didn\u2019t want to cause a sensation. Thus she decided to cut out the medium-level one.The medium-level jade was sold out at the price of eight million yuan.Gu Ning continued to visit those shops. After six stores, she had collected another seven or eight high-level jade in different sizes. Their value varied of course. The biggest one was as big as a football, while the smallest one was as small as an apple.Other than those high-level jade, she also accumulated five medium-level jade.As for the low-level jade, Gu Ning ignored them directly.On her way, Gu Ning cut out two medium-level jade, and earned 23 million yuan.And the rest, Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to cut them out now. She had no intention to be famous.Till now, Gu Ning had made eighty-six million yuan in total by cutting out jade.The price of those raw materials varied from high to low levels. The expensive one cost dozens of thousands of yuan a pound, while the cheap one cost merely hundreds of yuan a pound. Thus Gu Ning had spent three million yuan on her raw materials in all.But if she cut out all her raw materials, she could earn six hundred to seven hundred million yuan.Gu Ning decided to collect more raw materials with jade in them before she sold some to Master Fu and Zhao Yuefeng.Every time Gu Ning bought a raw material, she would secretly put it into the telepathic eye space, so that she was able to carry a light backpack along the way.Gu Ning stepped in a shop again. This shop was much bigger than those she had visited. There were a lot more customers as well as raw materials in it too.Hearing the talks among others, Gu Ning then found out the shop just had a new group of high-level raw materials in. Those high-level raw materials were more likely to have jade in them.Of course, even though the green rate was higher, one needed to rely on his or her luck!Gu Ning immediately used her Jade Eyes to scan over those raw materials. There were indeed emeralds in them; one was even red.There were two raw materials with jade in them. One was a little smaller than a football, while the other was as big as two apples. The raw material with a red jade inside was as big as half a football.The minute Gu Ning found out there was a red jade in it, she liked it.Thus she pulled the cart ahead to it at once.However, when Gu Ning moved near to it, a woman around 30 years old in a fashionable suit picked it up before her. Gu Ning felt nervous.She knew the rules. You couldn\u2019t grab the raw material from others. You could only take it if others abandoned it.Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to lose the other two raw materials with green jade inside as well so she picked them up without further delay.Meanwhile, she fixed her eyes on the raw material with a red jade inside. As long as the woman put it down, she would pick it up.\u201cI don\u2019t think there is jade in this one. It looks ugly,\u201d a young man, who was standing beside the woman, said.\u201cNonsense! You can never judge from its appearance. Just because it looks ugly doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t jade in it,\u201d the woman retort.Hearing that, Gu Ning\u2019s heart skipped a heartbeat.\u00a0The woman must like this raw material too.Then the woman added, \u201cBut, I need to consider whether to buy it.\u201dAfter that, the woman put the raw material down, secretly remembering its number. She liked this raw material, but hadn\u2019t made up her mind to buy it yet.The second the woman left, Gu Ning picked the raw material up. She was greatly relieved.Fortunately, the woman hadn\u2019t decided to buy it yet, or Gu Ning would have to miss this rare jade. It must be priceless!Gu Ning continued to scan the raw materials with her Jade Eyes. She got another two with jade inside. Both were as big as two-thirds of a football.Those emeralds weren\u2019t enough, but Gu Ning decided to pay her bill putting them into the telepathic eye space first.It wouldn\u2019t be convenient if she carried lots of raw materials with her.The raw materials were the latest group, so they were expensive. The small ones cost ten thousand yuan a pound, while the big ones cost twenty thousand yuan a pound. Gu Ning bought five raw materials, which weighed 93 pounds. They cost 1.5 million yuan in all.Gu Ning put those raw materials into the telepathic eye space, then went back to shopping.Before long, Gu Ning found another one with a green jade inside. This time, the jade was much bigger. It was as big as two footballs.Gu Ning immediately moved it to her cart. It weighed at least 50 pounds, and it cost twenty thousand yuan a pound.That was to say, this raw material cost around one million yuan.Of course, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t care its cost at all. As long as there was jade in it, she would buy it even if it cost ten million.The jade inside was worth far more than ten million.Gu Ning could figure out the types of the raw materials from its power. The thicker the power was, the more valuable the jade was. However, Gu Ning still didn\u2019t know the exact price of the jade. The price depended on the buyer.\u201cGu Ning?\u201dRight when Gu Ning put the raw material into her cart, she heard someone call her name. The voice sounded familiar, so she knew who he was before she saw the person.Gu Ning looked over. It was Qin Yifan, who seemed surprised. She smiled kindly. \u201cNice to meet you. What a coincidence! Are you here to buy some raw materials too?\u201dQin Yifan was accompanied by Li Zhenzhen and a young man who was around 27 years old.Li Zhenzhen became upset when she saw Gu Ning here. She hated Gu Ning and didn\u2019t want to meet her again.On the other side, Gu Ning didn\u2019t care at all.\u201cYes! One of my old friends runs this shop. There is a new group of high-level raw materials, and I\u2019ve been informed to have a look. Actually I came to City G to check the raw materials here, but I didn\u2019t expect you\u2019re here for the same reason,\u201d Qin Yifan said. He looked delighted. No one knew whether he was so happy because he had met Gu Ning, or because he had met an acquaintance.\u201cI\u2019m interested in stone gambling too, but I\u2019m a new comer. I don\u2019t know much about it,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cYou can ask me if you have any questions,\u201d Qin Yifan said with kindness.\u201cSure!\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t reject, but it was another thing whether she would really turn to him for help.Li Zhenzhen couldn\u2019t stand that Qin Yifan was so kind to Gu Ning. She immediately walked over, \u201cThere is a weathered leather shell on the surface of the raw materials, which makes people unable to see the jade inside. Thus many people think that the stone gambling completely relies on luck, which is actually a wrong idea.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58\u201cThe raw materials possess many characteristics. We can judge the internal condition of a raw material according to these characteristics. From the perspective of petrology, the jade inside has a certain correlation with the color of the outer shell. The characteristics of \u201csonghua\u201d, \u201cpython stripe\u201d and \u201cmoss\u201d[1: Songhua, python stripe and moss refer to surface features of crust, distribution of colour and characteristics of fissure skeins of raw jade.] are important features for distinguishing the internal conditions of jadeite,\u201d Li Zhenzhen explained very professionally, like she was teaching Gu Ning. However, the disdain and arrogance in her eyes betrayed her.Li Zhenzhen was merely showing off her knowledge, and humiliating Gu Ning because she knew very little about stone gambling.While Li Zhenzhen was explaining, she checked the raw material in Gu Ning\u2019s cart with her eyes. She then said with dislike, \u201cThere is no python stripe, songhua or moss around this raw material. I\u2019m afraid this one is a waste material, Mis Gu.\u201dLi Zhenzhen\u2019s professional explanation received much acclaim from the people around her.\u201cThis young lady is so knowledgeable at such a young age!\u201d\u201cTrue! There aren\u2019t many young people who know a lot about the raw materials of stone gambling.\u201dHearing the praise, Li Zhenzhen felt more proud, like she had greatly defeated Gu Ning.Li Zhenzhen\u2019s family was involved in the jewelry business too. She had grown up with a variety of jade, and had good acquaintance with the raw materials of stone gambling. In the past, she had cut out several medium-level jade.Although she had bought more waste materials, she had earned some money in all.The jewelry brand of the Li Family wasn\u2019t in the third-line jewelry brands, but was famous in City G.The Li Family had a wealth of 500 million yuan, which was a real super rich family, but compared with the third-tier richest families, it was left far behind.Moreover, their company\u2019s assets not only belonged to the Li Family, but also belonged to the shareholders.Li Zhenzhen\u2019s explanation was correct and true, so Qin Yifan wasn\u2019t aware she was being unkind.\u201cMiss Li is right, but a raw material without songhua, python stripe and moss doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t jade in it. I like this one, and I would like to give it a try,\u201d Gu Ning replied airily.Gu Ning admitted that Li Zhenzhen was professional, but no matter how professional she was, she wasn\u2019t able to determine which raw material had jade inside. Li Zhenzhen\u2019s professional knowledge couldn\u2019t be more accurate than her Jade Eyes.Gu Ning knew there must be an emerald in this raw material because of her Jade Eyes, while Li Zhenzhen was certain this was a waste material. It was obvious who was right.Gu Ning only cared about who would be the winner. To win was the most important thing.Li Zhenzhen sneered, but pretended to compliment Gu Ning, \u201cMiss Gu is so determined!\u201dEven though Qin Yifan didn\u2019t think highly of that raw material in Gu Ning\u2019s cart either, he didn\u2019t know how to stop the argument since Gu Ning seemed so sure.\u201cYifan, brother, let\u2019s check the raw materials!\u201d Li Zhenzhen urged. She didn\u2019t want to stay with Gu Ning.\u201cGu Ning, why don\u2019t you join us?\u201d Qin Yifan kindly invited.\u201cYifan\u2026\u201d Li Zhenzhen wanted to stop him.But before Li Zhenzhen could say another word, Gu Ning refused first, \u201cThanks, but I don\u2019t think there is a need for that, since the shop isn\u2019t big.\u201d\u201cWell, fine! If you need any help, please let me know.\u201d Qin Yifan didn\u2019t insist. The shop wasn\u2019t big. It wasn\u2019t difficult to meet again.Gu Ning nodded then pulled her cart away.Right at that moment, the woman who had picked up the raw material with a red jade inside came back.Apparently, she decided to buy the raw material.But unfortunately, the raw material was Gu Ning\u2019s now.The woman was disappointed and regretful. She had lost the raw material that she liked.Gu Ning ignored her and kept on shopping.Before long, two raw materials with jade inside came into Gu Ning\u2019s sight. One was as big as a football, while the other was as big as one-third of a football. The second one was in the hand of a man, who was around 40 years old.Gu Ning obviously couldn\u2019t go and grab it.Gu Ning picked up the other one. She stopped looking at the one in the man\u2019s hand.She wasn\u2019t that selfish to have all the raw materials with jade inside. The reason why she had stared at the raw material with a red jade inside was that red jade was rare. She didn\u2019t want to miss it.Since it hadn\u2019t been cut out yet, Gu Ning had no idea whether it was high-level or medium-level.Gu Ning turned to another pile of raw materials, and got another two with green jade inside. Although they were only as small as an apple, the color was special.After a while, she got another one which was as big as two footballs.Gu Ning planned to cut out two or three raw materials here. She also picked up two big waste materials as a disguise.Gu Ning was easily noticed for she was a young girl. Besides, she picked up raw materials so carelessly, which also attracted a lot of attention from people around her.Gu Ning knew people were staring at her, but she didn\u2019t care.The raw materials Gu Ning had chosen weren\u2019t small, nor cheap. They cost 4.5 million yuan in total.After paying her bill, Gu Ning noticed the man was stilling checking the raw material in his hand. She had an impulse to tell the man to buy it now.But she also knew the man possibly wouldn\u2019t believe her. She wasn\u2019t an experienced expert after all.\u201cGee! Isn\u2019t this the boss of Zhoufu Jewelry, Zhou Zhenghong? Oh, the ex-boss, because I am the boss of Zhoufu Jewelry now. What? Do you still have money to play stone gambling after you\u2019ve lost everything?\u201dA bright, but sarcastic male voice sounded.Everyone, Gu Ning included, looked over at once.Zhoufu Jewelry had 16 years of history with hundreds of millions in assets. It was a relatively low-level brand.The previous chairman was Zhou Zhenghong, and Shao Ping became its chairman half a year ago.The reason was still a secret.Shao Ping was in a suit with a briefcase in hand. He was a little fat, walking with his head up and chest out. He was followed by several men, and looked like a powerful man.But Shao Ping squinted his eyes with viciousness.Hearing that voice, Zhou Zhenghong, the man who was holding the raw material in hand, quickly raised his head. \u201cShao Ping,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong clenched his teeth. His eyes were full of hatred.Facing Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s hatred, Shao Ping didn\u2019t care at all. He continued to mock, \u201cI heard that you want to restart your business, but I think you can stop, and save the money for your son\u2019s tuition fee!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Zhou Zhenghong didn\u2019t want to argue with Shao Ping in public. Besides, he had no chance to win. Thus Zhou Zhenghong swallowed down his anger, saying coldly, \u201cIt\u2019s none of your business. Shao Ping, take care of yourself in case something bad happens to you out of the blue.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not afraid at all! Who cares what a loser says. Zhou Zhenghong, do you have enough money to buy one piece? If you don\u2019t have, I can lend you some,\u201d Shao Ping humiliated Zhou Zhenghong.\u201cWho says who can\u2019t afford! Uncle Zhou, let\u2019s go to the counter.\u201d Gu Ning walked over, pulling Zhou Zhenghong away before he could struggle.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhou Zhenghong was very surprised. He didn\u2019t expect the young girl would be that strong.He understood this young girl was helping him, but he did not have money to buy the raw material.Shao Ping didn\u2019t know Zhou Zhenghong was with a young girl. He was a little upset, but also wanted to know what Zhou Zhenghong could get.\u201cYoung girl, I\u2019m not buying,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong said awkwardly.\u201cMr. Zhou, I know you\u2019re still optimistic about this raw material, but you have concerns. In fact, I\u2019m also optimistic about this raw material. If you are not willing to take full risks, we each can pay half of this raw material. If it\u2019s valuable, we can share the profit. If it\u2019s not, you won\u2019t lose much money either.\u201d Gu Ning knew Zhou Zhenghong liked this raw material too, but because he lacked money, he hesitated.If Zhou Zhenghong planned to buy this raw material, Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t compete with him. She could wait till he dropped it.But Gu Ning had her own plan. She approached Zhou Zhenghong for a reason.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dZhou Zhenghong changed his mind.He did not dare to take the risk, but also liked this raw material. Thus he hesitated.If someone was willing to share the cost with him, he would like to try.But it was a young girl. Zhou Zhenghong believed she didn\u2019t need to take the risk. He didn\u2019t want to take advantage of a young girl. \u201cYoung girl, if it\u2019s a waste material, you will lose money too,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong said.\u201cI know, but if it\u2019s valuable, I\u2019ll win money! Besides, that\u2019s gambling,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Zhou Zhenghong hesitated for a while longer, then agreed at the end.This raw material weighed around six pounds. It cost ten thousand yuan a pound, and around sixty thousand yuan in total.The buyer of the raw materials needed to register and sign. Since they bought it together, they needed to sign both of their names.After signing and paying, Gu Ning let Zhou Zhenghong take the raw material to cut it out together.On their way, Gu Ning pushed her cart with her. Zhou Zhenghong was astonished. \u201cDid-did you buy all of these?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning answered.Zhou Zhenghong swallowed with great force.\u00a0This young girl must be from a rich family!Since she was a rich kid, Zhou Zhenghong was relieved. And they had already paid the bill.Shao Ping stood afar looking at Zhou Zhenghong. So he had no idea Zhou Zhenghong and Gu Ning bought the raw material together.Besides, Gu Ning was merely a teenager. Shao Ping didn\u2019t believe Gu Ning bought it, so he believed Zhou Zhenghong must be the only buyer.He knew although Zhou Zhenghong went bankrupt, he wasn\u2019t that poor and could afford a raw material.But when Shao Ping noticed the cart full of raw materials pushed by Gu Ning, he was shocked.How could Zhou Zhenghong afford those raw materials? They cost at least millions!Shao Ping immediately walked over. \u201cGee! Zhou Zhenghong, how can you afford these raw materials?\u201dZhou Zhenghong didn\u2019t want to talk with Shao Ping, but he didn\u2019t want to cause a misunderstanding either. So he explained, \u201cThese aren\u2019t mine.\u201dHearing that, Shao Ping was relieved, then he mocked, \u201cIndeed, I forget you\u2019re too poor to afford that many raw materials now.\u201dBut if these raw materials weren\u2019t Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s, then it must be the young girl\u2019s.Who can afford all of these raw materials at one time?\u00a0This young girl must be from a rich family.\u00a0Shao Ping thought.\u00a0What\u2019s her relationship with Zhou Zhenghong?No matter what the relationship between them was, Shao Ping felt jealousy already.He was worried that someone would help Zhou Zhenghong to restart his business, which would be a threat to him. He had done a lot to defeat Zhou Zhenghong.Zhou Zhenghong just gave him a cold glance, then walked straight to where the stones were cut out.\u201cLet\u2019s see what you can get.\u201d Shao Ping followed up.As long as there was someone to cut the raw materials, people in the shop would gather around to have a look.Although there were several machines, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t in a hurry to cut hers out.After drawing the lines, the worker started to cut.After a cut, a light green showed. The worker raised his voice in excitement, \u201cA green jade!\u201dThe crowd was excited at once. The most excited one was Zhou Zhenghong.A green jade! There was a green jade in it!Shao Ping, at the same time, felt upset, with his eyes full of viciousness.He had schemed so hard to make Zhou Zhenghong go bankrupt. Was he going to fail?No, no\u2026Before long, an emerald the size of a man\u2019s palm was fully cut out.Its color was light and pure. It was of the hibiscus type.Hibiscus type was the type ranked between glutinous rice type and ice type. It belonged to the upper quality types, and was very valuable.Feeling the strong power, Gu Ning naturally absorbed it in.The jade was out. People began to bid.\u201cFive million yuan.\u201d\u201cSix million yuan.\u201d\u2026\u201cEighteen million yuan.\u201dAt last, the jade of the hibiscus type was bid to a high price of eighteen million yuan.It was sold at the price of eighteen million yuan at the end.No one was more thrilled than Zhou Zhenghong.He finally had money.\u201cMiss Gu.\u201d Zhou Zhenghong walked to Gu Ning, wanting to talk about the money.\u201cYou can keep all the money in your card for now,\u201d Gu Ning said.Hearing that, Zhou Zhenghong was struck dumb. \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid I would take all the money and disappear?\u201d\u201cI trust you,\u201d Gu Ning said with determination. She didn\u2019t really trust Zhou Zhenghong, but wanted to give him a test.If he ran away, then she had made a wrong decision. If he didn\u2019t, then he passed the test.With the money, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for Zhou Zhenghong to start his business afresh. And when he found out what were in Gu Ning\u2019s raw materials later, he would know what the right choice was.Feeling he was being trusted, Zhou Zhenghong was moved. He was an upright man himself.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60If he had been a malicious man, he would have thought Gu Ning was dumb to trust a stranger.Zhou Zhenghong went to sign the contract, and Shao Ping had already left.Gu Ning planned to cut her raw materials out, when Qin Yifan and his friends came towards her.Both Qin Yifan and Li Zhenzhen had a cart with them. In Qin Yifan\u2019s cart, there were two materials, while in Li Zhenzhen\u2019s cart, there were three raw materials.Seeing there were seven raw materials in Gu Ning\u2019s cart, Qin Yifan and his friends were all astonished.Jesus! He had checked for so long to choose these two. Gu Ning had picked up seven already. Was she buying expensive raw materials or cheap vegetables?Li Zhenzhen was amazed too, but then she sneered.Although she knew Gu Ning had a lot of money, she had never seen anyone waste money like that.\u201cGu Ning, are you buying expensive raw materials or cheap vegetables?\u201d Qin Yifan found it interesting.\u201cI am buying raw materials at the price of cheap vegetables.\u201d Gu Ning laughed. She used her Jade Eyes to scan the raw materials in their carts.Qin Yifan had one big and one small raw material. The big one was a little bigger than a football. Unfortunately, it was a pure stone. The small one was as big as half a football. There was jade in it, but it was too small and in the size of a baby\u2019s fist.Gu Ning judged from the thickness of its fog that it was a high-level jade.But Gu Ning had no intention to tell him. She didn\u2019t want to cause herself trouble.As for Li Zhenzhen, she had three raw materials. Two of them were as big as half a football. One was a pure stone, while the other had a medium-level jade inside.The last was slightly bigger than a football, but it only had a thin layer of green inside.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to buy them all?\u201d Qin Yifan asked with uncertainty. He intended to remind Gu Ning to be careful, but he didn\u2019t stop her directly, because no one knew whether there was jade inside or not.If he stopped her, and there was jade in the raw materials, he would have done the wrong thing. Gu Ning would probably hate him for that.\u201cI already paid the bill,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cWhat? You already paid?\u201d Qin Yifan was shocked again. He didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning to be so efficient. \u201cHow much did you pay?\u201d he asked.\u201c4.5 million,\u201d Gu Ning answered. She stayed calm from the beginning to the end, like 4.5 million was nothing to her.Of course, she knew these raw materials were valuable, or she would not pay that much to buy seven stones.Although 4.5 million meant nothing to Qin Yifan too, it was still hard for him to spend that large an amount of money on raw materials at one time.\u201cYou\u2019re really indulging yourself.\u201d Qin Yifan didn\u2019t know what else to say.\u201cMiss Gu, do you plan to cut them out? I\u2019m curious how many of them have jade inside,\u201d Li Zhenzhen said with disdain. Qin Yifan now noticed she was being unkind, and felt displeased.\u201cZhenzhen, stone gambling largely relies on one\u2019s luck. Even you can\u2019t be 100% sure to cut out jade from every raw material with your professional knowledge. Songhua, python stripe and moss aren\u2019t the essential marks of a raw material with jade inside,\u201d Qin Yifan said plainly.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Li Zhenzhen felt embarrassed. She agreed with what Qin Yifan had said, but she was mad that he stood up for Gu Ning against her.The silent man who followed them all along frowned a little. He was Li Zhenzhen\u2019s older brother. He apparently also felt dissatisfied that Qin Yifan helped Gu Ning.But what Qin Yifan had said wasn\u2019t wrong, so Li Zhenyu could do nothing but stay quiet.\u201cWell, it seems Miss Li is confident about your ability. Why don\u2019t you pick one and compete with mine?\u201d Gu Ning challenged Li Zhenzhen.She didn\u2019t want to be a coward.People around them focused on them at once. No one wanted to miss the bet.Facing the challenge, Li Zhenzhen couldn\u2019t wait to accept it.\u201cNo problem! You can use three of your raw materials to compete with mine. Whoever can cut out the most valuable jade wins. If no one can cut out jade, then it\u2019s even.\u201d Li Zhenzhen was confident there must be one raw material with jade among her three raw materials.At the same time, she also believed Gu Ning couldn\u2019t cut out a single emerald. Even if she had only one raw material with jade inside, she would win.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Qin Yifan hesitated. They had chosen these raw materials with great care. Although they weren\u2019t confident all of them had jade inside, there was a good possibility to cut out jade.And Gu Ning made her choices all by luck. It wasn\u2019t dependable.But before he could say something, Gu Ning already accepted, \u201cVery well, but we need to put money in the bet, or it will be boring.\u201d\u201cHow much?\u201d Li Zhenzhen asked. Apparently she agreed.\u201cLet\u2019s say ten million yuan,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSure!\u201d Li Zhenzhen answered without hesitation.Li Zhenzhen accepted Gu Ning\u2019s condition so quickly not because ten million yuan was nothing to her. Actually she didn\u2019t have that much money herself.She was merely confident that it was impossible for her to lose.Now it was too late for Qin Yifan to stop them. One was his great old friend, the other one was his new friend. He didn\u2019t want either of them to lose; thus he could only pray it would be even.From the beginning to the end, Li Zhenyu never interfered. He was obviously confident too.Li Zhenzhen picked a raw material randomly. Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to scan it. It was a waste material. Thus Gu Ning chose a waste material too.Although it was a waste material, Gu Ning still paid.There were two machines. After Gu Ning and Li Zhenzhen had paid their bills, two workers started to cut the stones.Although Li Zhenzhen was confident, she paid a lot of attention to Gu Ning\u2019s raw material.After one cut, there was nothing in it. Then it was the second cut, and still nothing in it. After the third cut, it was still a stone. The raw material had been cut half out without any green. It must be a waste material.Seeing Gu Ning\u2019s was a waste material, Li Zhenzhen felt relieved, but hers was the same, which disappointed her a lot.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61\u201cMiss Gu.\u201d Zhou Zhenghong went back to stand beside Gu Ning. He looked much more delighted than before.\u201cUncle Zhou,\u201d Gu Ning called him. Zhou Zhenghong didn\u2019t run away. Gu Ning was satisfied and gave him a sincere smile.The second time, Li Zhenzhen chose a raw material with jade inside. Gu Ning did the same thing.Although Gu Ning\u2019s wasn\u2019t big, the species of the jade was much more valuable than Li Zhenzhen\u2019s.\u201cRub this one, please.\u201d Gu Ning\u2019s raw material was just a little bigger than an apple and its outer layer was thin. It was better to rub it.It took more time to rub a stone than to cut it directly. Before long, Li Zhenzhen\u2019s raw material was cut out. A layer of green showed.\u201cIt\u2019s green inside!\u201dThe crowd erupted into discussion. They had just witnessed an emerald cut out. Now there was another one.Li Zhenzhen was excited. She threw a provocative glance to Gu Ning. Qin Yifan, on the other hand, was worried about Gu Ning.As for Gu Ning herself, she was calmer than ever.\u201cIt\u2019s an emerald!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a medium-level jade of the glutinous rice type!\u201dNo one was happier than Li Zhenzhen now. She again gave Gu Ning a provocative and proud glance.Although it was just a medium-level jade, it was big, and was worth a lot.But while Li Zhenzhen was enjoying her success, Gu Ning\u2019s raw material showed green at the same time. Li Zhenzhen became upset at once.How come? How was it possible? How could Gu Ning\u2019s raw material show green?Li Zhenzhen couldn\u2019t accept the truth. She ran over immediately. There was a layer of green indeed, but its type was still unknown.Qin Yifan and Li Zhenyu were both surprised. They also didn\u2019t expect there would be jade in a raw material randomly picked up by Gu Ning. Meanwhile, Qin Yifan was relieved but Li Zhenyu was displeased. He obviously didn\u2019t want Gu Ning to win.Zhou Zhenghong was amazed too. He didn\u2019t know Gu Ning had Jade Eyes at all, and Gu Ning had helped him gain a lot of money just then. Thus Zhou Zhenghong believed Gu Ning must be an expert, and he already thought highly of her.Now, Gu Ning\u2019s raw material showed green again. Zhou Zhenghong greatly admired her now.Li Zhenzhen clenched her fists. She prayed to herself that Gu Ning\u2019s jade was worthless or a low-level jade. As long as it was worse than hers, Li Zhenzhen would be satisfied.Unfortunately, the fact went the opposite way.Li Zhenzhen\u2019s jade was in the same size of Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s jade of hibiscus species.Once the jade was cut out, someone bid immediately.But Li Zhenzhen wouldn\u2019t sell it anyway since her family dealt in the business of jade.Thus when someone wanted to bid, Li Zhenyu stopped him, \u201cSorry, everyone. We are not going to sell this jade.\u201dThe crowd felt disappointed, but they couldn\u2019t force the owner to sell the jade.Therefore, they could only hope that Gu Ning would sell hers.Since her raw material showed green, it was highly possible there was jade inside.After a while, Gu Ning\u2019s jade was cut out. After cleaning it with water, it showed its real appearance.The texture was smooth and warm. It had great transparency and light shiny color. It looked like a glass.\u201cThe glass type! It is the old-pit glass type!\u201d The worker\u2019s hands, which were holding the jade, were trembling because of excitement.Hearing that, everyone drew a long breath in, they were all shocked.Old-pit glass type was the top-level type among jade! All of the sudden, Li Zhenzhen\u2019s medium-level jade of the glutinous rice type seemed worthless.Li Zhenzhen was more than upset now. It was so hard for her to believe the result.Gu Ning immediately absorbed the power.There was one last raw material waiting to be cut, but given what had happened, Li Zhenzhen was very likely to lose. If she couldn\u2019t cut out a jade which was more valuable than a jade of old-pit glass species, she would certainly lose.However, it was so difficult to do that.Even though, Li Zhenzhen still had hope. It wasn\u2019t the last second.\u201cMiss Gu, do you want to sell this jade? I\u2019ll pay ten million yuan for it.\u201d\u201cFifteen million yuan.\u201d\u201cTwenty million yuan.\u201d\u2026\u201cForty million yuan.\u201dThe last bid was from Li Zhenyu. Li Zhenzhen felt dissatisfied at once. \u201cBrother, how can you buy her jade?\u201dHearing that, Li Zhenyu frowned slightly. He was a little dissatisfied too. \u201cZhenzhen, don\u2019t forget I\u2019m a businessman,\u201d Li Zhenyu warned.He would protect Li Zhenzhen from the emotional aspect, but it didn\u2019t mean he would ignore his family\u2019s business.The jewellery industry always lacked top-level jade. It was so hard to find one, and Li Zhenyu would never give it up just because of Li Zhenzhen\u2019s jealousy.Li Zhenzhen was upset, but she couldn\u2019t do anything about it.\u201cSixty million yuan.\u201dThe bid stopped at the price of sixty million yuan, which was reasonable.The bidder was Qin Yifan.He came to City G for jade. He would never allow himself to miss such a rare top-level jade.Although he and Li Zhenyu were good friends, business was business. Only the most generous buyer would get the jade.At the end, Qin Yifan got the old-pit glass jade from Gu Ning at the price of sixty million yuan, but they had to wait to sign the contract and transfer the money until the bet was over.\u201cMiss Li, if your last raw material doesn\u2019t have a jade which is worth more than sixty million yuan, then you\u2019ll lose,\u201d Gu Ning said provocatively.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Li Zhenzhen was irritated now. If she had been jealous of Gu Ning before, now she hated Gu Ning to the death.Zhou Zhenghong then realized Gu Ning had a bet with Li Zhenzhen. He admired Gu Ning\u2019s ability even more now.The last round, Gu Ning chose a raw material with a purple jade inside. It wasn\u2019t big though, just the size of two apples. She decided to have it be rubbed too.Meanwhile, Li Zhenzhen still had hers cut.After a cut, the out layer was removed, and a pure green showed widely.\u201cIt\u2019s green inside!\u201d\u201cIs this the old-pit ice type?\u201dThere was another round of excited shout. Li Zhenzhen, who had a vain hope, now felt thrilled.Old-pit ice species was a high-level separate among jade, and only ranked lower than the old-pit glass species. If this one was big enough, it was still possible for Li Zhenzhen to beat Gu Ning.Qin Yifan couldn\u2019t help glancing at Gu Ning. Even Zhou Zhenghong felt concerned, but Gu Ning stayed calm as usual. No one knew whether she was being confident, or didn\u2019t care about the result.Since Gu Ning had earned that much money, ten million yuan was nothing to her.But it was too early to be worried or proud now. The final result wasn\u2019t out yet.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62Right at that moment, the worker made another cut. Everyone held his or her breath, fixing their eyes on the machine.However, there was no more green showing, instead there was white stone inside like what it was on the outside.Everyone was disappointed at once. There was only a thin layer of green.\u201cNo, impossible. This is impossible.\u201d Li Zhenzhen couldn\u2019t accept the truth. It was a jade of the old-pit ice type. How could it have disappeared!\u201cCut it again, again!\u201d Li Zhenzhen shouted.The worker continued, but there was only stone left.Li Zhenzhen was struck dumb standing there.She lost. She lost the bet.\u201cMiss Li, you lose,\u201d Gu Ning reminded her.Hearing Gu Ning\u2019s voice, Li Zhenzhen suddenly looked at her. She didn\u2019t say a word, but her eyes were full of viciousness.Gu Ning smiled lightly. She didn\u2019t care and didn\u2019t want to urge Li Zhenzhen. She moved her sight to her raw material which was being rubbed instead.\u201cIt\u2019s green inside!\u201dAn encouraging voice sounded. There was a light shiny purple which showed, but the window was small, so the color wasn\u2019t very obvious.After several rounds of rubbing, the color showed gradually. It was light purple.\u201cIsn\u2019t-isn\u2019t this violet?\u201d\u201cWhat? Impossible!\u201dHearing violet, the crowd all rounded their eyes in shock.\u201cNo, no, this can\u2019t be true\u2026\u201d Li Zhenzhen was losing her control over her emotions.\u201cCan it be just a thin layer?\u201d\u201cIf it is violet, this young girl is so unbelievably lucky! She has two high-level jade out of three raw materials.\u201dEveryone looked to Gu Ning with great admiration. Some felt envious too.When the worker finished rubbing, and cleaned the jade with water, a shiny violet jade of the glass type came into everyone\u2019s sight.\u201cViolet! It is violet! It is a violet jade of the glass type!\u201d The worker\u2019s hands were trembling quickly. It was too much for his heart to bear.He had cut out stones for half of his lifetime. This was his first time to cut out two high-level jade consecutively, especially this violet.Purple was the rarest color of jade, and glass was the rarest type of jade. This jade was a very pure purple. It was a highly elegant purple. The light charming color was like the haze from the east, which was full of implicit beauty.No one was more excited than the boss, who almost fainted, but he was thrilled not because of happiness, but because of regret.He knew this new group of raw materials had a high green rate, but he didn\u2019t expect the rate would that high.The number of raw materials which had been cut out today was merely around 10, but there were four of them that had jade, two even had high-level jade inside!If he had cut them out himself, he would be super rich overnight!But it was too late to do that. He didn\u2019t have the nerve to cut out all his raw materials. If there was no jade inside, he would lose every cent he had.Although the violet jade of the glass type was ranked at the same high-level as the jade of the old-pit glass type, it was much more expensive because of its rarity.Thus the bid began from thirty million yuan.\u201cForty million yuan.\u201d\u201cFifty million yuan.\u201d\u2026\u201cSeventy million yuan.\u201dAt the end, the violet jade was sold out at the price of eighty million yuan. The buyer was still Qin Yifan.Li Zhenyu did want to compete for the violet jade, but he didn\u2019t have enough money for it. The Li Family wasn\u2019t in the same level of wealth as the Qin Family after all. Besides, the last bid was almost higher than the value of the violet jade.Qin Yifan was truly from the super rich family. He paid 130 million yuan for two jade within a day.Actually, 130 million yuan was the highest price Qin Yifan could pay for the jade.The Qin Family had hundreds of million in assets, and was ranked the fourth richest family in City F on the list. The Qin Family was universally acknowledged as the second-line super rich family.But the Qin Family was involved in many industries other than Yicui Jade-store. Yicui Jade-store was merely inherited from the ancestors. The Qin Family didn\u2019t want to close it and ran it as a sideline.Thus, the Qin Family actually didn\u2019t have much cash on hand.The 130 million yuan was the best Qin Yifan could do. He didn\u2019t want to miss the high-level jade.As for Gu Ning, Qin Yifan now more than just appreciated her. He admired her greatly.No matter if Gu Ning was only lucky, or if she truly had the ability, she could cut out great jade, which was everything in this industry.They needed to sign the contract and transfer money.\u201cOh, Miss Li lost the bet between us. Please transfer the ten million yuan to me as well,\u201d Gu Ning reminded. Although she said it airily, Li Zhenzhen felt utterly displeased.\u201cGu Ning, will you stop!\u201d Li Zhenzhen scolded. Her face changed because of anger, as if she had been treated unfairly.\u201cWhat? Why should I stop? You agreed on the bet. Do you want to deny it?\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d She indeed wanted to deny it, but she cared about her reputation. If she really denied it, her reputation would be ruined.\u201cPlease allow me to transfer the money.\u201d Although Li Zhenyu felt disappointed too, he had to follow the rules. If there was any negative rumors that went abroad, his family\u2019s business would be affected too.\u201cBrother\u2026\u201d Li Zhenzhen unconsciously called her brother. She didn\u2019t actually want to stop him. She merely felt helpless.But no matter what Li Zhenzhen had in her mind, it wasn\u2019t a good time for her to utter another word. Thus the minute she opened her mouth, Li Zhenyu gave her a warning glance. She shut her mouth at once.Qin Yifan, at the same time, was like an outsider. He had no intention to help Li Zhenyu and Li Zhenzhen.Because he knew if Gu Ning had lost the game, they would do the same thing.Thus, Qin Yifan preferred to be an outsider.Before long, the contract had been signed and the money had been transferred.\u201cGu Ning, you\u2019re so awesome! How can you cut out two jade among three raw materials! Did you really choose the raw materials by luck? Do you have Jade Eyes?\u201d Qin Yifan was still excited. He accidentally told the truth.Although knowing Qin Yifan was joking, Gu Ning felt uneasy. She smiled. \u201cI\u2019m always a lucky person. That\u2019s all.\u201dQin Yifan looked at the left four raw materials in Gu Ning\u2019s cart. \u201cAre there more emeralds in your raw materials?\u201d\u201cI have no idea,\u201d Gu Ning replied casually.\u201cOh, it\u2019s almost 12 am. Let\u2019s go have lunch together!\u201d Qin Yifan invited.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Li Zhenzhen was in a rage now. She hated Gu Ning to the death. Now Qin Yifan even wanted to invite Gu Ning to have lunch together. Li Zhenzhen almost went crazy.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want Yifan to hate you, mind your behavior. We can deal with Gu Ning secretly,\u201d Li Zhenyu warned.He wanted Li Zhenzhen to be with Qin Yifan, because it would be helpful to the Li Family.Thus he naturally disliked Gu Ning, who had grabbed Qin Yifan\u2019s attention and defeated Li Zhenzhen.Or more technically, he hated Gu Ning because of the ten million yuan.Ten million yuan wasn\u2019t much to his family, but could be used to do many things. He would be lying if he said he didn\u2019t care.Li Zhenzhen was a little surprised, but also felt happy.True! If she wanted to deal with Gu Ning, she could do it secretly.City G was the domain of Li Zhenzhen. She had plenty of ways to deal with Gu Ning.Besides, she knew some gangsters. It was easy to hurt Gu Ning in Li Zhenzhen\u2019s eyes.Thinking of this, Li Zhenzhen felt comfortable and relaxed.\u201cNo, thanks. I have something else to deal with. Thank you,\u201d Gu Ning rejected Qin Yifan\u2019s invitation.\u201cFine.\u201d Qin Yifan didn\u2019t insist. He asked later, \u201cWill you be here later?\u201d\u201cNo, I won\u2019t come again,\u201d Gu Ning said. All the great jade was in her hands now. There weren\u2019t many left in the shop after all.She had used her Jade Eyes to earn a fortune. It would be too selfish if she collected all the valuable jade in the shops.Qin Yifan had to give up at the end. He only reminded Gu Ning to turn to him if she had any trouble.\u201cMiss Gu, let\u2019s go transfer the money.\u201d Zhou Zhenghong stayed by Gu Ning\u2019s side all the time. Knowing she was leaving, he asked on his own initiative.\u201cWe don\u2019t need to rush. Uncle Zhou, let\u2019s have lunch together,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cGreat.\u201d Zhou Zhenghong didn\u2019t reject. Gu Ning\u2019s money was still in his account after all.While they were leaving, Zhou Zhenghong helped Gu Ning take her raw materials which hadn\u2019t been cut open.After Gu Ning and the others were gone, the shop became popular and well-known. Everyone now knew there were two high-level jade that had been cut out in the shop.When people heard the owner of those two high-level jade was a young girl, everyone was amazed.Gu Ning didn\u2019t plan to leave the antique market now. Thus she chose a restaurant right in the antique market and booked a private dining room.\u201cMiss Gu, thank you so much for helping me this time! If it hadn\u2019t been for you, I would have abandoned that raw material. Then I would have lost so much money,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong thanked Gu Ning the minute they sat down.Gu Ning smiled. She didn\u2019t want to hide her real purpose, so she said straightforwardly, \u201cUncle Zhou, I don\u2019t want to lie to you. Let me tell you the truth! I helped you for a reason, especially when I found out your identity.\u201dHearing that, Zhou Zhenghong was surprised, and puzzled.She did it for a reason? For what? Why?Even though she knew his identity, it wouldn\u2019t be of great help. He had lost everything, and was a poor, ordinary man now. What was Gu Ning\u2019s purpose?Although knowing the young girl had helped him for a reason, Zhou Zhenghong wasn\u2019t mad. He knew Gu Ning wasn\u2019t a bad person.\u201cWhy?\u201d Zhou Zhenghong asked.\u201cBecause I\u2019ll be involved in the jewelry and jade industry, but I am still a student, I can\u2019t do it myself. I need a professional and competent manager. Although I don\u2019t know much about you, you didn\u2019t run away with the money just then. You\u2019re not a malicious man. And from the development of Zhoufu jewelry, your ability is also affirmed. So, after knowing your identity, I want you.\u201dWhat?Zhou Zhenghong rounded his eyes in shock.He didn\u2019t expect a teenage girl would be so ambitious as to run a company, and had even tested him before choosing him to be the manager.But, they were merely strangers who had only met each other once! Why would she trust him?\u201cWe just met for the first time. We\u2019re not acquaintances even. Why do you trust me?\u201d Zhou Zhenghong asked.\u201cYes, we met for the first time. We\u2019re not acquaintances even. I completely have no reason to believe you, but I am willing to believe you. The employer can\u2019t be suspicious, and the suspect can\u2019t be used. Although I care about my people very much, I never accept betrayal. If one treats me with sincerity, I\u2019ll give him or her a bright future. If one betrays me, he or she will be dead. No way around it.\u201dSaying the \u201cdead\u201d word, Gu Ning seemed murderous. Zhou Zhenghong was stunned, as if he was surrounded by the feeling of death. He held his breath.Zhou Zhenghong was a sophisticated businessman. He had met a variety of people, and he could judge from Gu Ning\u2019s air that she was a powerful as well as cruel person.Of course, she was only cruel to her opponents. She cared about her people very much.Facing Gu Ning\u2019s warning, Zhou Zhenghong didn\u2019t feel reluctant, instead, he trusted Gu Ning.As for Zhou Zhenghong, if he chose to follow Gu Ning, he would no betray her. He was an upright and loyal people himself.\u201cPerhaps, you\u2019re not optimistic about me, and don\u2019t want a young girl to be your boss. Or, you want to be the boss yourself, and restart your business, but, I believe you\u2019re a smart man, who knows clearly about the pros and cons. You need a lot of money and supplies to restart your business. However, let alone your lack of both of them, Shao Ping won\u2019t stand aside and let you start your own business. You probably couldn\u2019t register! Of course, you can avoid Shao Ping and go to other places, but if you don\u2019t have enough funds and supplies, it\u2019ll be very hard for you to develop.\u201dThat was exactly what was on Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s mind. Although he wanted to restart his business, he also clearly knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy.Even if he avoided Shao Ping, and went to another place, he lacked the money and supplies. He could fail again.\u201cAnd I can provide enough money and supplies for you. Probably in your eyes I was just lucky today, but it\u2019s not. I have my own unique skills, so I don\u2019t have to worry about money and supplies. If you\u2019re willing to accept my offer, you can have 20% shares of my jewelry company. You\u2019ll be fully responsible to run the company. To the public, you\u2019re the chairman and have all the rights of the chairman. I\u2019ll be a behind-the-scene boss. You can discuss with me on things you can\u2019t decide.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64Chapter 64: The Jade BeautyTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee TranslationsZhou Zhenghong was now completely shocked.He never doubted Gu Ning\u2019s ability of stone gambling. After knowing she had her own skills, he even thought more highly of her.But what shocked him more was that Gu Ning was willing to let him take over the company. He could even have 20% shares.Why would she trust him so much?There was nothing better than being trusted for your own ability and character! Undoubtedly, Zhou Zhenghong made up his mind.He actually valued a hard-working life over wealth. He wanted to live his life.Without hesitation, Zhou Zhenghong stood up, looking at Gu Ning. He said, \u201cMiss Gu, I\u2019m willing to follow you and I\u2019ll never betray you!\u201dAt the same time, Zhou Zhenghong made up his mind to run a greatly profitable business with Gu Ning.The temporary location of the company was in City G. Gu Ning planned to establish the headquarters of her company in the capital city when she went to university.The capital city was where she felt familiar and was going to stay.The brand was named the Jade Beauty, and her company was called the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company. Its major business was jade.As for other kinds of jewelry like gold, silver and so forth. Gu Ning planned to involve them in the future, not now.Since Gu Ning only had jade of great quality in her hands, she decided to make and sell high-end products. A piece of jewelry made of medium-high-level jade cost at least hundreds of thousands of yuan. If it was made of high-level jade, it would cost millions of yuan or more.Although there weren\u2019t many buyers, it was very profitable if one piece was sold.Zhou Zhenghong was in charge of finding factories and shops in City G. He also needed to hire staff and buy machines.He knew better than Gu Ning concerning those things. Thus Gu Ning didn\u2019t interfere.Zhou Zhenghong decided to use his previous designers and carvers. The boss of Zhoufu Jewelry had changed, and those workers who had followed him had all left.Because Zhou Zhenghong was known for his kindness, his old staff maintained a good relationship with him. After he had gone bankrupt, they had also helped him.Although their design and carvings weren\u2019t the top-level, they weren\u2019t worse than the third-line masters. They only needed a platform to practice and develop.The company\u2019s initial registration capital was a hundred million yuan, and more would be added later.For the jewelry industry, the registered capital of a hundred million yuan wasn\u2019t too much. It was still relatively little, because it required a lot of money to buy raw materials, but Gu Ning didn\u2019t need to do that. She already had the supplies now, and they were worth six hundred or seven hundred million yuan in total.Therefore, in terms of total funds, she had around seven hundred million yuan in assets, which was a big business.After that, Gu Ning would continue to get jade with her Jade Eyes. There was no need for her to use money to buy jade supplies.Gu Ning now had more than two hundred million yuan in cash. She invested a hundred million yuan in jewelry, and still had more than a hundred million yuan with her.She planned to cut out two high-level jade, and sell them to Zhao Yuefeng and Master Fu separately. In that way, she would have around seventy million yuan more in cash.Gu Ning asked Zhou Zhenghong to help her buy a well-decorated apartment near the downtown of City G. When she came to City G in the future, she needed a place to live. She could not always stay at the hotel.\u201cOh, boss, we\u2019ve sold the jade of the hibiscus type, and the money\u2026\u201d Zhou Zhenghong reminded Gu Ning. Gu Ning\u2019s share was about nine million.\u201cUse the nine million to buy me an apartment, and to cover some expense for the company,\u201d Gu Ning said.She wouldn\u2019t give nine million to others out of the blue.\u201cSure,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong answered.After the meal, Gu Ning told Zhou Zhenghong she wanted to cut out more raw materials.Gu Ning had already cut out several jade today. She didn\u2019t want to do it again in the public. She had no intention to cause a sensation.Zhou Zhenghong told her they could rent a machine as well as a private room from the raw materials shop.Accordingly, Gu Ning and Zhou Zhenghong walked to a raw materials shop.It was around 1 pm.On their way, Gu Ning called Zhao Yuefeng and Master Fu separately. She asked for their location, and told them she wanted to sell high-level jade.Zhao Yuefeng wasn\u2019t in the street of stone gambling, but he remained in the street of antiques, while Master Fu had already gone back home, but when he heard it was a high-level jade, he immediately said he would come soon.It took time to cut a stone. Gu Ning let Zhao Yuefeng wait for her call.As for Master Fu, Gu Ning told him to come slowly. She planned to cut out three raw materials, and it would take around half an hour. She told Master Fu to arrive around 3.30 pm.Gu Ning intentionally to let Zhao Yuefeng and Master Fu come at different times. She was afraid they would like the same piece of jade, and she wanted to avoid an argument.Although Zhao Yuefeng was the first buyer, which was a little unfair to Master Fu, Gu Ning thought it would be fine given both would be high-level jade.When they arrived at a raw materials shop, they rented a machine in a private room to cut out their raw materials.Gu Ning firstly picked up one in the size of half a football, then two others which were as small as an apple. They all had high-level jade inside. One of the small ones had the red jade which Gu Ning almost missed.This red jade, Gu Ning decided to make jewelry with it to send Gu Man and Gu Qing as gifts.Gu Ning drew lines on the big one first, then gave it to Zhou Zhenghong to cut.Meanwhile, Gu Ning rubbed the raw material with the red jade inside.Although Zhou Zhenghong already believed Gu Ning that she had special skills to choose a raw material, he was still excited when the green showed.When the jade was fully cut out, he became more thrilled.Seeing that, Gu Ning just smiled a little.While Zhou Zhenghong had cut out an emerald, Gu Ning\u2019s raw material showed color too.Zhou Zhenghong had a glance, taking in a long breath. He swallowed with great force. His voice was even trembling. \u201cIs it, is it red jade?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning replied calmly.Having the answer, Zhou Zhenghong almost bit his tongue. He was in great shock.The jade in Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s hand was as big as two adult palms.He was amazed when he found out the type of the jade. \u201cThis-this is the high-level glass type.\u201dIt was half transparent, so it was a high-level jade, no a top-level one.Meanwhile, Gu Ning\u2019s red jade widely showed too. It was shiny red with smooth texture and great transparency. It was the high-level cockscomb red.Zhou Zhenghong was hit by one shock after another. He couldn\u2019t get his mind back all of a sudden.\u201cRub the last one please.\u201d Gu Ning was running out of time. So she had to remind Zhou Zhenghong.Zhou Zhenghong immediately had his mind back, and rubbed the last raw material quickly.Although he knew there would be jade in it, he was still excited to see the green show.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Chapter 65: Fulushou JadeTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee TranslationsAfter a while, Gu Ning\u2019s cockscomb red jade was fully rubbed out.It was big enough in Gu Ning\u2019s eyes. She planned to make four bracelets, four pairs of earrings and four jade pendants for Gu Man, Gu Qing, Jiang Xinyue and herself. She would also make a thick jade ring for Jiang Xu. And the rest of the jade could be made into several jade pendants and pairs of earrings. Gu Qing decided to sell the rest, which would be worth dozens of millions of yuan.Gu Ning had seen the jewelry of the Qin Family. She liked their design and carving, and planned to let the Qin Family do the work for her.\u201cThis-this\u2026\u201dZhou Zhenghong was holding an emerald which showed half of it. He breathed fast, like his heart was going to jump out.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gu Ning asked with confusion.\u201cThis is Fulushou jade of the glass type!\u201d Zhou Zhenghong tried very hard to utter a word. He was still in shock.Knowing it was Fulushou jade, Gu Ning was also astonished.Fulushou was the kind of jade with four colors: green, red, purple or white. Fulushou jade was a symbol of happiness, fortune and health.It was rather rare, and super popular.It was worth at least a hundred million yuan, and was much more expensive than the violet jade of the glass type.Gu Ning immediately changed her mind. She decided to use this Fulushou jade to make jewelry for her family, while she sold the cockscomb red jade.Gu Ning absorbed the power of the cockscomb red jade, but she didn\u2019t absorb the power of the Fulushou jade.She planned to use the Fulushou jade to make jewelry for her family. With the power, the jade could last long in great condition.\u201cKeep on rubbing!\u201d Seeing Zhou Zhenghong being so shocked, Gu Ning felt like laughing, but she completely understood his feeling.Fulushou jade was extremely hard to find. It ranked just a little lower than the King\u2019s Green.Hearing Gu Ning\u2019s voice, Zhou Zhenghong then got his mind back. He took a deep breath, and calmed down.His hands were still trembling, because it was so precious. He was nervous, being afraid to damage it by accident.After 10 minutes, Zhou Zhenghong finally cut the whole jade out. He handed it to Gu Ning with his hands shaking slightly.Gu Ning took the Fulushou jade. She was deeply attracted to it too.Three raw materials had already been cut. It was almost 3 pm. Gu Ning planned to call Zhao Yuefeng.\u201cGreat, let\u2019s go!\u201d Gu Ning said. She stood up and cleaned the dirt on her clothes.When they were out of the raw materials shop, Gu Ning sent Zhou Zhenghong away to draw up a contract. They would sign it tomorrow.Although she trusted Zhou Zhenghong, they still needed to sign a contract, which was also a protection to Zhou Zhenghong himself.After Zhou Zhenghong was gone, Gu Ning went to a nearby restaurant, then called Zhao Yuefeng.Within three minutes, Zhao Yuefeng appeared in Gu Ning\u2019s sight.The street of stone gambling wasn\u2019t big. They were merely a hundred meters away.\u201cMiss Gu.\u201d Zhao Yuefeng was excited when he saw Gu Ning.\u201cPlease be seated,\u201d Gu Ning said. Zhao Yuefeng sat down immediately. \u201cWhat do you want to drink, Mr Zhao?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cNothing, let\u2019s see the jade first!\u201d Zhao Yuefeng refused at once. He was eager to see the jade.Gu Ning found it funny. They didn\u2019t need to rush at all.Fine, let\u2019s see the jade first!\u201cI have two high-level jade now, but I can only sell one to you, the other is for Master Fu. Since you\u2019re not far away, I\u2019ll let you choose first. Please don\u2019t tell Master Fu.\u201dGu Ning said, then took out two emeralds from her backpack.Zhao Yuefeng was thrilled and amazed when he heard Gu Ning had two high-level jade, but he soon felt disappointed that he could only buy one.Since the other one was for Master Fu, Zhao Yuefeng couldn\u2019t argue against it. He was still moved that Gu Ning allowed him to be the first buyer.Zhao Yuefeng rounded his eyes in shock when the two emeralds were on the table.He knew they were high-level jade, but didn\u2019t expect there would be a cockscomb red jade.Zhao Yuefeng wanted the red jade the minute he saw it.\u201cMiss Gu, I honestly don\u2019t know what to say! How can you cut out four high-level jade within a day, no, a morning! That\u2019s unbearable!\u201dZhao Yuefeng swallowed down with great force. He was totally astonished by Gu Ning\u2019s luck.If Zhao Yuefeng had known Gu Ning had cut out more than just four high-level jade, he would have been completely struck dumb.Of course, Gu Ning still had 10 more raw materials with jade inside.\u201cMr Zhao, you can choose,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cThe red jade please,\u201d Zhao Yuefeng immediately replied.\u201cGreat, you can have a look first, then tell me your price.\u201d Gu Ning gave the red jade to Zhao Yuefeng.Zhao Yuefeng took the red jade with his hands trembling.\u201cMiss Gu, I\u2019ll pay 35 million yuan for it.\u201d This cockscomb red jade was ranked at the same level of the old-pit ice type jade he had just bought, but the price of the red jade was much higher.35 million yuan was a reasonable price.\u201cDeal!\u201d Gu Ning agreed without hesitation.Then, they both had a wonderful deal.After the deal Zhao Yuefeng left, because Master Fu called.A few minutes later, Master Fu arrived.\u201cMiss Gu, where is the jade? Where is the jade?\u201d Master Fu raised his voice in excitement before he approached Gu Ning. He walked fast towards her. If his two servants hadn\u2019t supported him, he would have fallen down.Gu Ning immediately stood up to welcome Master Fu. \u201cPlease slow down. The jade won\u2019t escape.\u201d\u201cA high-level jade. I must be quick! I am afraid it\u2019ll run away!\u201d Master Fu said seriously, like the jade would really run away from him.Before Gu Ning could say another word, Master Fu urged, \u201cCome on, show me the jade!\u201d\u201cPlease have a seat first. I\u2019ll show you at once,\u201d Gu Ning said. She immediately took the jade of the glass type out of her backpack.Although Master Fu knew it was a high-level jade, he was still thrilled and amazed to see it with his own eyes..\u201cGreat jade. Great jade!\u201d Master Fu took the jade at once. He was staring at it with fondness, but in his heart, he still felt a little disappointed. If it had been a top-level old-pit glass species, it would be much better.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66Chapter 66: An \"Accident\"Translator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u201cGirl, I\u2019ll pay thirty million yuan for this jade of the glass type. How about that?\u201d Master Fu said.\u201cNo problem,\u201d Gu Ning answered. It was a reasonable price.For now, Gu Ning had around 270 million yuan with her.\u201cHa-ha, I like your efficient way of making a deal. Great, I\u2019ll transfer the money to you now.\u201d Gu Ning\u2019s efficiency left a good impression on Master Fu again. He immediately made a call to transfer the money.\u201cGirl, if you don\u2019t mind, you can call me grandpa Fu. If you need my support in the future, just let me know. I\u2019ll spare no effort to help you,\u201d Master Fu said. He sincerely wanted to become friends with this young lady.Master Fu was sophisticated. He had a belief that Gu Ning was a promising teenager.\u201cGrandpa Fu, I do need your help now.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate to ask for help from Master Fu.\u201cOh, what happened? Tell me.\u201d Master Fu was a little surprised and curious.\u201cWell, I plan to register a jewelry company, but I also know that this process is very troublesome. So, do you have any acquaintances in the Industry and Commerce Bureau? Could you please help me make the process smoother, faster? Of course, I\u2019ll prepare all the required documents.\u201d Since Master Fu was willing to help, Gu Ning naturally couldn\u2019t waste the chance. Actually she decided to make full use of her network. There was nothing wrong with it anyway.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to open a jewelry company?\u201d Knowing that, Master Fu was amazed. This young girl was very ambitious.She even had the nerve to open a jewelry company!\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning replied seriously.\u201cHow much is the registered capital?\u201d Master Fu asked.\u201cThe initial capital is a hundred million, which will be added to in the future,\u201d Gu Ning said.Master Fu took a long breath in. Even though a hundred million wasn\u2019t much in the jewelry industry, it was a huge amount of money to a young girl.This girl wasn\u2019t an ordinary teenager.But, although Gu Ning was an extraordinarily smart girl, it was risky to start up a company.Master Fu asked with uncertainty, \u201cAre you sure you\u2019re going to open a jewelry company? To start up a business needs more than just money. You must have the ability to run it, with stable supplies. Besides, you\u2019re a student now. Do you have enough time to manage it?\u201dMaster Fu wasn\u2019t going to stop Gu Ning. He was just worried that Gu Ning didn\u2019t fully understand the rules and might lose money.Gu Ning knew Master Fu cared about her. She replied with sincerity, \u201cGrandpa Fu, I\u2019m fully prepared. Moreover, I have professional staff to help me run the company. There is nothing to worry about.\u201dSince Gu Ning was confident, Master Fu didn\u2019t want to let her down. \u201cGreat, it is no big deal. I\u2019ll help you with the registration. Oh, how old are you now?\u201d\u201cThanks, grandpa Fu. I\u2019m already 18. I\u2019m an adult,\u201d Gu Ning said. \u201cBut I still need to find a shop. I\u2019ll contact you once I find the shop.\u201d\u201cSure, no problem. I\u2019ll handle it,\u201d Master Fu said delightedly.\u201cThank you so much, grandpa Fu,\u201d Gu Ning said.Master Fu didn\u2019t stay much longer before he left. After Master Fu was gone, Gu Ning left too.She went to the street of antiques.Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to collect antiques. She simply wanted to take a chance. Thus she didn\u2019t walk into stores, but looked around the small stands outside.Although not every piece in the stores was authentic, the real one would be labeled with a price on it. It was expensive.After a while, Gu Ning felt disappointed. She didn\u2019t see a single real antique yet.She continued looking for a longer time. Finally, she found an object with power at a small stand. It was a wine cup. Its power was very thick, which meant it must have a long history.\u201cHey, how much is this?\u201d Gu Ning pointed at a wine cup.Seeing Gu Ning was a young girl, the stand owner assumed she wouldn\u2019t buy it, so he replied perfunctorily, \u201cIt\u2019s from the Qianlong period. ten thousand yuan. \u201dAn object from the Qianlong period. How was it only worth ten thousand yuan? It was worth at least five hundred thousand yuan.Therefore, it must be a fake one in the stand owner\u2019s eyes.But this time, the stand owner was wrong. This wine cup was an authentic one. Gu Ning only wasn\u2019t sure which period it was from.Since it was real, Gu Ning didn\u2019t care about the ten thousand yuan at all. She immediately took out a pile of bills from her backpack for the stand owner.The stand owner didn\u2019t expect this teenage girl would really buy it without bargaining. He was surprised.He had actually believed that this teenage girl wouldn\u2019t buy it, so he deliberately set such a high price. Otherwise, this would only be sold at the price of several hundred yuan.Was it a real one?The stand owner himself didn\u2019t believe there were any authentic antiques on his little stand. It wasn\u2019t easy to get a real one after all.This young girl must know nothing about it. She merely liked it.The stand owner was apparently happy to sell it at a high price. He happily took the money in case the buyer would regret.However, he didn\u2019t know he actually was the one who should regret.The stand owner took the money, and Gu Ning got her wine cup. The deal was done. No one could regret.Gu Ning put the wine cup into her backpack standing up.Right at that moment. Something broke under her feet. There were a lot of broken china pieces. A man shouted in pain, \u201cOh, shit! My Green-bean glaze vase!\u201dAfter that, the young man glared at Gu Ning. He yelled in anger, \u201cIt\u2019s you! You knocked my vase over on the ground. Now it\u2019s broken. You have to pay me the money for it.\u201dGu Ning immediately knew she encountered someone who intentionally caused an \u201caccident\u201d.That wasn\u2019t unusual in the antique industry. Someone would use a fake antique to deliberately cause an \u201caccident\u201d, and demanded compensation at the same price as a real antique.Someone like that could easily succeed, because they always chose the weak ones to take advantage of.And Gu Ning appeared to be a teenage girl, who must be easily scared. Thus she became the target.Nonetheless, no one was willing to help in case they got involved in the trouble.But the man made a wrong decision. Although Gu Ning was a teenage girl, she didn\u2019t allow anyone to bully her now.\u201cI did not touch your vase,\u201d Gu Ning said calmly.The man simply tried to trap her, but she truly didn\u2019t touch his vase.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67Chapter 67: Run AwayTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u201cWhat? If you didn\u2019t touch it, my vase wouldn\u2019t have fallen!\u201d the man argued.\u201cSo what?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cThis is a green-bean glaze vase from the Kangxi period. It\u2019s worth at least five hundred thousand yuan on the market! Since you\u2019re a young girl, five hundred thousand yuan would be enough.\u201dGu Ning sneered. The man was literally shameless.\u201cWell, I can compensate you, but your words aren\u2019t enough. So, I need to let an expert identify it. If it is truly worth five hundred thousand yuan, I\u2019ll pay you right away,\u201d Gu Ning said.The man panicked a little. His tone softened. \u201cDon\u2019t need to bother! It costs a lot to see the expert. I have a certificate of authenticity myself. It can prove this vase is real.\u201dSaying this, then man pulled out his so-called certificate of authenticity. Gu Ning didn\u2019t believe it of course. \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019ll pay the expert fee,\u201d she added.The man stopped a second. He now realized he had made a wrong decision, but he didn\u2019t want to give up.\u201cI don\u2019t have time to waste with you. I need the money now! Pay me right now, or I\u2019ll call the police,\u201d the man warned. He immediately took out his phone, like he was going to call.Gu Ning pulled the corner of her lips. She knew the man was threatening her.Then she said airily, \u201cFine, go on!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The man didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t be scared at all, which left him in a dilemma.Meanwhile, a nearby man suddenly stopped him, \u201cMan, don\u2019t be so annoyed. We can negotiate anyway. She\u2019s merely a teenager. It\u2019ll be bad for her future if she is arrested by the police. Why don\u2019t you give her a bargain?\u201dThe man seemed like he was helping Gu Ning, but he was actually an accomplice.Unfortunately, Gu Ning saw through them clearly.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?\u201d An old man\u2019s voice sounded at the same time.Before long, a group of people stepped into the crowd. Two old men who were around 70 walked in front.One of them unexpectedly was Master Fu.\u201cGirl, it\u2019s you? What happened?\u201d Seeing it was Gu Ning, Master Fu was a little surprised. It seemed Gu Ning was in trouble.But the young man who demanded compensation suddenly changed his face.Obviously, he knew the group.\u201cOh, it\u2019s just an accident. Just an accident.\u201d Before Gu Ning could open her mouth, the man said at once. His made a U-turn on his attitude.He was afraid of these two old men before him.No one in the antique market didn\u2019t know Master Fu and Master Yan. Those two were the authorities. No one dared to offend them.Especially Master Yan, he wasn\u2019t only the father of the mayor of City G, but also an undeniable expert in the antique field.He could tell whether the vase was real or not by his own eyes.Those two men who wanted to take advantage of Gu Ning were shocked by the fact that Gu Ning knew Master Yan and Master Fu.But Master Yan and Master Fu immediately understood what had happened when they saw the broken china pieces on the ground. Both were upset.It wasn\u2019t unusual for such \u201caccidents\u201d to happen, but when it happened to Gu Ning, the perpetrators were in trouble now.Mater Fu regarded Gu Ning as his friend and his granddaughter. He would naturally protect her.Thus, master Fu was displeased and asked. \u201cIs it a real accident?\u201dHe didn\u2019t believe it apparently.The young man had a layer of cold sweat around his forehead at once. He did want to say yes, but it obviously wasn\u2019t a wise answer.At the end, the young man couldn\u2019t bear the pressure from Master Fu any longer. He apologized, \u201cMaster Fu, I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault. I promise I won\u2019t do it again.\u201d\u2018\u201cThe person you should apologize to isn\u2019t me,\u201d Master Fu was mad.The young man immediately turned to Gu Ning. He even bent to a low level. \u201cMiss, I\u2019m so sorry. Please accept my apologies.\u201d\u201cI accept your apologies this time, but I\u2019ll have my people here to keep an eye on you. If you dare to do that again, you\u2019ll be in jail the next time!\u201d Gu Ning said.She threatened them to stop them from doing it again.\u201cSure, sure.\u201dThose two answered at once. They were like rats on the street now. The only thing in their mind now was to leave as soon as possible.After that, they immediately ran away.\u201cIt happens often in this street. You must be careful from now on,\u201d Master Fu said to Gu Ning. If they hadn\u2019t arrived on time, Gu Ning would have been taken advantage of.\u201cI will, grandpa Fu.\u201d Even though Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t allow anyone else to bully her now, she replied to Master Fu\u2019s kindness with sincerity.\u201cWell, now let me introduce you. This is Master Yan, the president of the Antiques Association,\u201d Master Fu said to Gu Ning.\u201cNice to meet you, Master Yan,\u201d Gu Ning greeted politely.\u201cYou too.\u201d Master Yan was a serious man, especially before the young generation.So he replied airily when Gu Ning greeted him, but he didn\u2019t disdain her at all.\u201cWell, now if you\u2019ll excuse me, I\u2019ll leave now,\u201d Gu Ning said.After Master Fu gave her an affirmative nod, Gu Ning left.Later, she used her Jade Eyes to scan the objects around her.Within a few meters, she found out another object with power. It was an ink slab with a strong power.Gu Ning immediately went over. She asked the price, then paid the money at once.She only paid five thousand yuan for an authentic antique.Master Fu and Master Yan were not far behind Gu Ning. Both of them witnessed what Gu Ning had done, and they were shocked.They didn\u2019t know whether Gu Ning understood antiques or not, but she casually bought one without identification.\u201cGirl, you\u2026\u201d Master Fu walked to Gu Ning quickly. He wanted to stop her, but he was late. The deal was done. Master Fu sighed heavily.\u201cDo you know antiques, young girl?\u201d Master Yan followed up. His tone was still serious.Although Master Yan disliked her behavior, he didn\u2019t judge her for that since it was none of his business.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68Chapter 68: A Battle for the Ink-slabTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u201cEm, not really,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cThen why did you buy this ink-slab without second thought?\u201d Master Fu criticized. He expected better from Gu Ning.\u201cBecause of my instinct. May I invite the two masters to have a cup of tea? Master Yan, could you please help me identify this object?\u201d Gu Ning said.Master Yan was an expert of antiques. He had a special feeling for antiques, and never said no to identifying an object.He only thought it wasn\u2019t necessary to have tea.But seeing Gu Ning being so confident, like this ink-slab was a real one, Master Yan was more curious now.If the ink-slab had been real, it was inconvenient to identify it here. Thus Master Yan answered, \u201cFine.\u201dThey went towards a nearby tea house.They had a private room since they were all important figures.Before they sat down, Master Yan opened his mouth eagerly. \u201cGirl, let me have a look now.\u201dThe ink-slab was held in Gu Ning\u2019s hand. Once Master Yan opened his mouth, Gu Ning handed it to him directly.Master Yan took the ink-slab, and was absorbed in identifying it.Both Master Fu and Gu Ning stayed quiet, tasting the tea.Master Yan kept on observing, touching and cleaning it for a while. At the end, Master Yan\u2019s eyes lit up with delight and excitement. \u201cIt\u2019s real. It is real! This is an ink-slab from the Qianlong period. It belonged to the famous poet, book painter and Laizhou prefect, Zhang Wentao. It must be old-pit species too!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing that, Master Fu was also surprised as well as excited.Such a precious antique was found by a young teenage girl, which surprised Master Yan more. He asked, \u201cGirl, did you really find this out by your instinct?\u201dTo be honest, Master Yan didn\u2019t believe it was that simple. Gu Ning had been so confident, as if she already knew it was a real one.Gu Ning also understood her excuse wasn\u2019t persuasive, but she didn\u2019t know anything about antiques. Thus she had to stick to her excuse. \u201cYes.\u201dMaster Yan and Master Fu still couldn\u2019t believe it, but since the girl said so, they didn\u2019t want to ask for more.Master Yan looked at the ink-slab in his hands. He was growingly thrilled. \u201cGirl, do you want to sell it? If you want to, I can pay you the market price,\u201d Master Yan said.Not only was Master Yan an expert of antiques, he was also an expert of calligraphy. He loved those tools for calligraphy.\u201cWell, Master Yan, I knew Girl Gu before you. If she wants to sell it, I must be the first buyer. You, you can\u2019t grab it from me!\u201d Master Fu immediately stood up wanting to snatch the ink-slab.Although Master Fu wasn\u2019t as professional as Master Yan, he was an aficionado.He didn\u2019t like calligraphy, but he loved to collect ancient objects.Gu Ning felt embarrassed. She didn\u2019t want to see those two respectable seniors to have a battle over a ink-slab.Gu Ning understood Master Fu wanted to have priority because they met first.Master Yan, on the other side, protected the ink-slab tightly in his arms at once. He looked at Master Fu in an aggressive way. \u201cMaster Fu, you don\u2019t like calligraphy at all. Why do you need it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t like calligraphy, but I love ancient objects!\u201d Master Fu said.Master Yan was truly afraid Gu Ning would sell the ink-slab to Master Fu because the two had met each other before him. He had to use his ace in the hole. \u201cIf you don\u2019t compete with me, I\u2019ll give you a bottle of peach-blossom wine of 10 years,\u201d Master Yan said to Master Fu.Hearing that, Master Fu\u2019s eyes were bright. He stopped competing for the ink-slab, but bargained, \u201cTwo bottles.\u201dMaster Yan frowned. He was reluctant to do that.But for the ink-slab, he compromised at the end. \u201cFine, two bottles.\u201d Master Yan clenched his teeth.After that, Master Fu was pleased. He went back to his seat.And Master Yan then realized Gu Ning hadn\u2019t agreed to sell the ink-slab yet.\u201cWell, girl, could you please sell it to grandpa Yan?\u201d Master Yan looked at Gu Ning with sincerity. It seemed the ink-slab was a part of his body. If Gu Ning took it back, it would be like cutting meat from his flesh.Master Yan right now was completely different from that serious old man before.Actually, the reason why Gu Ning invited Master Yan to identify the ink-slab was that she intended to sell it to him.She wasn\u2019t sure Master Yan would want it, but since he was an expert of antiques, he probably wasn\u2019t willing to miss a real antique.\u201cOf course,\u201d Gu Ning replied.Master Yan was more than happy now. \u201cVery well, girl! I\u2019m not going to lie to you either. This ink-slab is from the Qianlong period. It belonged to the famous poet, book painter and Laizhou prefect, Zhang Wentao. It is worth around five million yuan. I\u2019ll pay you five million yuan. It\u2019s an acceptable price for both of us.\u201d\u201cNo problem,\u201d Gu Ning agreed without hesitation. She didn\u2019t care about the price as long as it was acceptable.\u201cGirl, if you\u2019re lucky again next time, you must sell it to me first!\u201d Although he stopped competing with Master Yan, Master Fu was still a little displeased.Gu Ning smiled slightly. \u201cGrandpa Fu, you\u2019ve abandoned the ink-slab for two bottles of peach-blossom wine. I assume you must be a wine lover. I have a wine cup with me here. Do you want to have a look?\u201dSaying this, Gu Ning then took out the wine cup from her backpack.Both Master Yan and Master Fu were struck dumb for a second. They all thought to themselves: is she being lucky again?If she had been lucky again, she must be a lucky girl indeed! Or, she must have her own ability.Master Fu sat close to Gu Ning. Once she pulled the cup out, Master Fu grabbed it and stared at it.But he wasn\u2019t an expert after all. He then immediately gave it to Master Yan. \u201cMaster Yan, take a look now.\u201dWith doubts in heart, Master Yan took the wine cup from Master Fu at once.The wine cup was round, straight, covered with a deep abdomen, a beast ring and three feet. It was the shape of the wine cups from the Tang Dynasty.Then Master Yan focused on its material and marks.Master Fu sat aside looking at Master Yan with anxiety. He opened his mouth several times, wanting to ask for the result, but didn\u2019t want to bother him as well.Master Yan was increasingly excited. \u201cIt\u2019s real! It\u2019s from the Tang Dynasty. It\u2019s a royal wine cup from the Wu administration.\u201d\u201cWhat? Really?\u201d Master Fu jumped up from his seat out of excitement.Seeing that, Gu Ning felt worried for Master Fu. She didn\u2019t want to see him fall.\u201cYes! It must be a real one. There are several royal wine cups in the museum too. I\u2019m familiar with them,\u201d Master Yan replied.\u201cHa-ha, Ha-ha! I like it!\u201d Master Fu laughed out loud in happiness. He was afraid Master Yan would compete with him, so he grabbed the wine cup back. Both Gu Ning and Master Yan were speechless.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Chapter 69: TrappedTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee TranslationsAlthough Master Yan liked this wine cup from the Tang Dynasty, he had just gotten an ink-slab. He wouldn\u2019t compete with Master Fu again.\u201cMaster Yan, how much is this wine cup?\u201d Master Fu asked.\u201cThose wine cups in the museum were worth three hundred thousand yuan each 10 years ago. By now, its price must be 10 times higher. Around three million yuan,\u201d Master Yan said.Although this wasn\u2019t the royal object used by Empress Wu, it was an object in the palace. And the quality was superior. It must have been used by a royal, so the price was still not low.\u201cGreat, then I\u2019ll pay three million yuan. How about that Girl Gu?\u201d Master Fu asked Gu Ning.\u201cNo problem,\u201d Gu Ning replied.After the deal, they transferred the money without signing contracts.Gu Ning trusted those two old men. They wouldn\u2019t regret or break rules.Besides, the deals were done. Even if the antiques weren\u2019t real, they could do nothing about it.After everything was done, Master Yan and Master Fu then realized something important. Master Yan asked Gu Ning, \u201cDid you buy the wine cup by chance too?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Gu Ning said honestly.Both Master Yan and Master Fu took a long breath in after Gu Ning\u2019s affirmation.Even though they had no idea how Gu Ning could know these two objects were authentic, they were surprised by her unbelievable luck.Before long, Gu Ning asked to leave.Master Fu intended to invite Gu Ning to have dinner with them, but Gu Ning refused because she had something else to deal with.Before she left, Master Yan gave her a name card. \u201cGirl, if you don\u2019t mind, you can call me grandpa Yan, like the way you call Master Fu. If you need my support in the future, you can call me. And of course, if you have any other real antiques, you can let me have a look first, but I\u2019ll only buy one if I like it.\u201dApparently, Master Yan wanted to make a friend with Gu Ning.\u201cNo need to worry, grandpa Yan. If I find out any authentic antiques in the future I\u2019ll call you first,\u201d Gu Ning said and took the name card.She didn\u2019t have her own name card, so she pulled out a piece of paper and a pen. She wrote down her name and phone number on the paper, then handed it to Master Yan.\u201cHey! You can\u2019t only turn to Master Yan! You must turn to me as well!\u201d Master Fu said. He didn\u2019t want to be left out.\u201cI will.\u201d Gu Ning felt like laughing. These two seniors were really pleasant!After Gu Ning was gone, Master Yan couldn\u2019t help but compliment, \u201cThis girl is truly extraordinary!\u201d\u201cIndeed! She\u2019s even cut out three high-level jade this morning, and made a hundred million yuan at once!\u201d Master Fu added.\u201cWhat? How is it possible? She cut out three high-level jade in a morning!\u201d Master Yan was shocked. He had never heard of such a thing before.Master Fu didn\u2019t mention Gu Ning was going to open a jewelry company. If he had said so, Master Yan would probably be shocked dumb.Master Fu knew what he could say, and what he shouldn\u2019t. Gu Ning\u2019s company hadn\u2019t registered yet. It would be inappropriate to say it now.Gu Ning had already called her driver when she had left the street of stone gambling. Her driver had arrived half an hour ago, but Gu Ning had met Master Fu and Master Yan halfway, and she was half an hour late.When she went out of the street of antiques, she saw a familiar car and went over.But when she opened the car door, she found the driver was a different man.Before Gu Ning could ask, the young man opened his mouth first. \u201cNice to meet you, Miss Gu. The driver who drove you here felt a little uncomfortable, so I replaced him to be your driver today.\u201dGu Ning didn\u2019t doubt that. She nodded, then climbed into the car.The car was started then left.Driving away from the street of antiques, the car didn\u2019t go back the same way that they came here. Before Gu Ning could ask again, the young driver explained, \u201cIt\u2019s rush hour now. There is a traffic jam ahead. We can go another road, and save time. We\u2019ll be back to the hotel within an hour.\u201dGu Ning wasn\u2019t familiar with City G, but she knew it must be super crowded in rush hour. Thus she didn\u2019t doubt the driver\u2019s explanation.Like what the young driver had said, he had chosen a less crowded road.But around 20 minutes later, the car drove into an ally in a remote place. Gu Ning then realized something must be wrong.She immediately seized the young driver\u2019s neck, and said coldly, \u201cStop the car.\u201dThe young driver didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning would realize so soon, and was so strong. When his neck was seized, he could hardly breathe. He stopped the car unconsciously.\u201cTell me, who sent you?\u201d Gu Ning asked.The young driver didn\u2019t answer her question. Before he could, several men ran to surround the car from two meters away.Gu Ning was annoyed. She directly knocked the young driver unconscious.\u201cDid the girl just knock the driver unconscious?\u201d A man standing in front of the car saw what had just happened inside it. He said in surprise to another man beside him.\u201cWhat?\u201d The other man was also surprised. A teenage girl knocked a grown-up man unconscious?But the man wasn\u2019t frightened by Gu Ning at all. He ordered instead, \u201cGo pull the girl out now!\u201dHowever, before anyone came forward, Gu Ning opened the car door herself.Her Jade Eyes was full of power now, and she was full of energy too. She wasn\u2019t afraid of these men outside at all.Gu Ning stepped out herself, so the man who planned to pull her out stopped.When they saw Gu Ning\u2019s face, all the men were amazed by her beauty.What a beautiful young girl!Gu Ning coldly glanced over those men before her. They were all aged between 20 and 30, and behaved like gangsters.They must be gangsters. Gu Ning thought to herself.The man who was their head was around 30. He was a bulky man in a black sweater and loose pants. He seemed violent.If an ordinary person had seen him, he or she would be terrified, but Gu Ning wasn\u2019t an ordinary girl. She wasn\u2019t scared at all.\u201cLi Zhenzhen sent you here, right?\u201d It was an affirmative tone.Gu Ning only had bad blood with Li Zhenzhen when she was in City G. No one would do that except her.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70Chapter 70: A Woman\u2019s Usual WayTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee TranslationsHearing that, those men were apparently struck dumb for a second. They were surprised Gu Ning knew who was behind them.They soon understood Gu Ning must have had bad blood with Li Zhenzhen earlier, so she knew what was happening.Therefore the head man didn\u2019t want to hide.\u201cYoung girl, since you know who you had bad blood with, you must know you\u2019ve done something terribly wrong. We\u2019re here today to teach you a lesson. Sorry,\u201d the head said.Knowing that, Gu Ning despised Li Zhenzhen. Li Zhenzhen didn\u2019t even bother to hide herself.It seemed she was too confident.Indeed, Li Zhenzhen was so confident that she believed Gu Ning could only yield to these grown-up men.\u201cOh, since you do know someone can never be irritated, aren\u2019t you afraid I am one of those who you should never have bad blood with?\u201d Gu Ning asked calmly. She didn\u2019t seem scared at all.Hearing that, these men were struck dumb for a second before laughing out loud.\u201cYoung girl, do you know who we are? We\u2019re from the Qing Gang. Qing Gang! Have you heard of us? We\u2019re one of the two biggest gangs in this mainland. And you can never get revenge on us,\u201d the man said with disdain.Gu Ning felt nervous. She didn\u2019t expect they were from the Qing gang.Anyway, since they were here to cause her trouble first, Gu Ning decided to fight against them till the end.Besides, she couldn\u2019t believe the head of the gang would be an irrational man. If so, how could he be able to be the head? How would he manage his followers?\u201cI don\u2019t want to get revenge,\u201d Gu Ning compressed her lips, and said lightly. When those gangsters believed she must be terrified, Gu Ning continued. \u201cBecause you\u2019re not able to defeat me.\u201dAfter that, Gu Ning attacked them first. She came straight at the so-called head, kicking abruptly at his abdomen.Gu Ning had moved too fast, so the man didn\u2019t have time to react. He was hit right in his abdomen, he was then kicked up in the air like he had been hit by a heavy object. Right on the heels of that, he fell down heavily on the ground, moaning in pain.The other three men rounded their eyes in shock. What had just happened? They couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. Were they in a dream?Gu Ning didn\u2019t care what they were thinking at all. She directly attacked another man.Although the second man noticed Gu Ning\u2019s coming, he was hit by a fist right on his cheek before he could fight back. The second man fell straight on the ground spitting blood with several teeth knocked out.The other two gangsters now felt a little scared, but they didn\u2019t want to run away like cowards. Thus they raised their fists, running at Gu Ning.Gu Ning took off her backpack, throwing it to hit the front man dashing at her. The front man was hit on his head by a great force then knocked against a nearby wall. He fell from dizziness afterward.Gu Ning used her backpack to hit the last man, but the man escaped quickly.However, Gu Ning immediately kicked out her leg aiming at the man\u2019s knee. The last man lost his balance all of a sudden, bending his knee.\u201cGee, are you proposing to me? Sorry, you don\u2019t deserve me,\u201d Gu Ning humiliated him.She then hit the man right on his head with her backpack again. The man wasn\u2019t able to avoid it this time, and fell on the ground.Four gangsters were all beaten to the ground by Gu Ning within minutes. Although they were not hit till handicapped, they couldn\u2019t stand up any more.Gu Ning didn\u2019t leave right away. She walked to their head instead.\u201cYou, what, what do you want to do\u2026\u201d The head was frightened. He wanted to escape, but couldn\u2019t stand up, let alone run away.Gu Ning didn\u2019t answer his question. She picked up his phone on the ground, and asked, \u201cDid Li Zhenzhen call you?\u201d\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the man immediately replied.Then, Gu Ning opened his phone, checking his recent calls. Li Zhenzhen\u2019s name was really on it. She had called at 2:15 pm, and the call had lasted for seven minutes.\u201cWhat did Li Zhenzhen want you to do to me? How much for it?\u201d Gu Ning continued.\u201cShe-she wanted us to rape you, and take a video of it, then put it on the Internet. She paid us a hundred thousand yuan for it,\u201d the man answered.Gu Ning sneered, but her face looked cold. Her eyes were full of upset.Rape, what a usual way a woman used to deal with another one. Shao Feifei had done that before. Gu Ning assumed the women who she would have bad blood with in the future probably would do the same thing.She didn\u2019t doubt that.But Shao Feifei had only paid several thousand yuan, while Li Zhenzhen paid a hundred thousand yuan. Was Gu Ning\u2019s dignity worth only a hundred thousand yuan?No, Gu Ning\u2019s dignity was priceless.This time, Gu Ning really wouldn\u2019t forgive Li Zhenzhen.Although Shao Feifei had done the same thing to her, Shao Feifei couldn\u2019t threaten her at all. She could punish Shao Feifei in a gentle way, but as for Li Zhenzhen, who turned to the Qing Gang for help, which was a big trouble. Gu Ning was completely irritated.She used the man\u2019s phone, calling Li Zhenzhen back directly.At the same time, Li Zhenzhen was having a meal with Qin Yifan in a restaurant. The atmosphere was quite harmonious.\u201cYifan, I heard there is a movie called Growing Up Together, which is very popular recently. Why don\u2019t we go and watch it together?\u201d Li Zhenzhen invited Qin Yifan with anticipation in her eyes.She wanted to watch the movie for a reason.The movie mainly told a story about a couple who grew up together. She and Qin Yifan also grew up together.Thus, Li Zhenzhen intended to use the movie to express her feelings to Qin Yifan.Although this wasn\u2019t the first time Li Zhenzhen told Qin Yifan her feelings for him, and she had been refused many times, she kept trying because she loved Qin Yifan.Moreover, their marriage would be of great help to the Li Family.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71Chapter 71: You Will Pay for ItTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u201cSorry, I have something to deal with. You can go with your friends,\u201d Qin Yifan said. It was simply his way of refusal.\u201cEvery time I invite you to watch a movie, you\u2019re always busy.\u201d Although Li Zhenzhen knew it would end up like that, she felt hurt when she heard the answer.She had abased herself before him to the best of her ability. Why would he keep being so cold?Li Zhenzhen was a beautiful, sexy and well-educated woman from a rich family. She had everything a man could expect from a woman. And she had countless admirers, but Qin Yifan was clearly not one of them.She wasn\u2019t going to be his younger sister, or girlfriend. She wanted to be his wife.\u201cYifan\u2026\u201d Li Zhenzhen wanted to say more, but her phone rang.Li Zhenzhen\u2019s phone was placed on the edge of the dining table. The caller was Liu. Li Zhenzhen felt nervous for a second, then she was delighted.\u201cUm, I need to take this call.\u201d Li Zhenzhen took her phone immediately standing up and left her seat. She didn\u2019t want Qin Yifan to hear a word.Li Zhenzhen ran straight outside. She answered the phone. Out of excitement, she asked first before the other side could open the mouth, \u201cHey, Liu, did you finish it? I\u2019ll transfer the rest of the fifty thousand yuan to your account later.\u201d\u201cOh, Miss Li, my dignity is only worth a hundred thousand yuan in your eyes?\u201d Gu Ning sneered.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Hearing Gu Ning\u2019s voice, Li Zhenzhen trembled in shock. She almost threw her phone away. Why? How could it be possible?What had happened? Why did they take the money but fail to do what she had asked?\u201cMiss Li, I\u2019ll bear in mind what happened today. And you will pay for it. Be careful!\u201d Gu Ning warned her plainly.\u201cYou dare to threaten me?\u201d Although Li Zhenzhen felt afraid, she was irritated by Gu Ning\u2019s words. Her face changed, she looked vicious now.\u201cYes, I did threaten you,\u201d Gu Ning admitted without hesitation. Li Zhenzhen was in a rage now, but also felt regretful.After a while, Gu Ning added, \u201cMiss Li, since you\u2019re capable of doing that, you have to bear the consequences.\u201dThen Gu Ning hung up the phone before Li Zhenzhen could say a word.Li Zhenzhen was so mad that she almost smashed her phone. She actually didn\u2019t know Gu Ning\u2019s background, but since Gu Ning had Liu\u2019s phone to call her, Gu Ning must not be an ordinary person.Thus Li Zhenzhen felt uneasy about Gu Ning\u2019s threat.Now, Li Zhenzhen was truly not in the mood to watch a movie. She forced herself to finish the meal with Qin Yifan, then asked him to drive her home.She was worried something terrible would happen to her on her way home.Li Zhenzhen stopped asking Qin Yifan to keep her company, which made him happy.But if he had known the reason, he would probably not have been so calm.On the other side, Gu Ning hung up the phone, then directly threw it back to the man. She turned around and left.Gu Ning didn\u2019t know whether they would try to get revenge on her. All she could do was protect herself.Gu Ning walked to the car. She pulled the unconscious man away from the driver seat, then dumped him on the ground. She sat inside herself.Gu Ning started the car, and left.After Gu Ning was gone, at the opposite side of the ally, a black Maserati stopped there. The car window moved slowly down.There were two men sitting inside, watching the way Gu Ning left.On the driver seat, a young man who was around 25 was in a casual suit. His face was full of amazement and excitement. \u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect this young girl could be so strong and powerful! I feel like having a fight with her!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll lose for sure.\u201d a cold voice sounded from the passenger seat. The young man immediately felt upset.The man who sat on the passenger seat was several years older. He was almost 30 with beautiful features. He had an air of power.Hearing that, the young man was displeased. He complained, \u201cBoss, don\u2019t upset your own friend, alright?\u201d\u201cCan you defeat them all within a minute?\u201d the man inquired.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d The young man felt shamed. Apparently, he couldn\u2019t.Although he could beat them down within a few minutes, he couldn\u2019t do it the way the girl had done it.\u201cXuanfeng, find out who these guys\u2019 head is. How dare them take a buyer\u2019s money secretly without my permission!\u201d the man said coldly. He was obviously annoyed.The man was actually the chairman of the Qing Gang, Situ Ye.Although Qing Gang was a gang, it had principles and rules. It was unacceptable to take a buyer\u2019s money secretly and charge the fee of protection, which was amoral.Of course, even though there were rules, some people would break them as they liked.Even in the country, there were many corrupt officials.As long as they hadn\u2019t been discovered, they would continue to do amoral things.\u201cYes, boss!\u201d Chu Xuanfeng answered.Gu Ning stopped aside after a short distance, not because she was lost, but she needed to find her real driver.She now was half worried and half doubtful towards the driver.What if the driver was one of the gangsters? What if the driver was in trouble himself?Gu Ning pulled over the car, taking out her phone. She called the driver at once.Unfortunately, no one answered.Right when Gu Ning was about to call the police, a noise sounded from the trunk. An idea suddenly dawned on Gu Ning. She immediately clicked a button, then stepped out of the car, walking to the trunk.There he was! The real driver who had been supposed to take her, was now tightly tied up struggling with his mouth stuck full of a rag in the trunk.Seeing Gu Ning, his eyes lit up at once. He knew Gu Ning must be here to rescue him. He mumbled in excitement to Gu Ning.Gu Ning was also relieved to see the driver was safe. She immediately untied him.The rag in his mouth was removed. The driver was free. He apologized at once, \u201cMiss Gu, I am so sorry. I have no idea why they did this to me. Thank you so much for rescuing me!\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72Chapter 72: Shopping in the Shopping CenterTranslator:\u00a0Henyee Translations\u00a0Editor:\u00a0Henyee TranslationsThinking of that, the driver was still trembling with terror.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my fault actually. They were targeting me,\u201d Gu Ning said, then she told him everything that had just happened.\u201cWhat?\u201d The driver was shocked, but he didn\u2019t blame Gu Ning since she was also a victim.Because a lot had just happened, when Gu Ning finally arrived at the hotel, it was already 8 pm. Gu Ning was starving so she immediately called room service.She had planned to buy clothes in the downtown this afternoon, but she didn\u2019t have time now.Although the shopping center was still open now, Gu Ning wasn\u2019t only going to buy clothes for herself. She would buy some for Gu Man and the family of Gu Qing too. Thus an hour wasn\u2019t enough for her to shop.Gu Ning didn\u2019t have another change of clothing. She had to wash her clothes tonight, and hopefully it would dry tomorrow.She had her school uniform in her backpack, but she didn\u2019t want to wear it. It would be too obvious in the crowd.Her dinner hadn\u2019t arrived yet. Gu Ning called Gu Man to chat with her for a short time.Then she talked with Chu Peihan and others in their WeChat group for a while.\u2026The evening wind was cool and mild. It danced with people walking by. Sometimes, it was a bit chilly.In the downtown of City G, there was the biggest entertainment place, King\u2019s Club.In the noisy club, colorful lights shone. Men and women crazily shook their waists on the dance floor and the air was full of desire and luxury.But in a private room which was set apart from the main hall, there was only light music and gentle talks.In this huge private room, there were only five men without a single bar girl.Apparently, something special was going on here.\u201cF*ck, we were just f*cking lucky this time. We even met the legendary Red Flame team captain, Red Wolf, who has killed seven of our people. All the troops were almost wiped out. Fortunately, we ran fast. Otherwise, we were f*cked,\u201d a young man groaned and slammed the cigarette butt into the ground, seemingly venting the anger in his heart.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that Red Wolf is very powerful. I didn\u2019t care, but I\u2019ve witnessed this time. He\u2019s really very powerful. He could fight with more than a dozen people, and killed seven. He only got shot twice,\u201d a bulky muscular man with a naked upper body said.Although he hated his opponent to death, he admired him too.\u201cLuckily he got shot, and wasn\u2019t able to track us. Or we would be found,\u201d a relatively short man with a vicious look said.\u201cBut we can\u2019t be too careless. After all, the other team is the captain of the important national team. Maybe he will send someone to follow us! So we\u2019ll be evacuated as soon as we successfully trade tomorrow.\u201d\u201cBut why do they have to choose the Commercial Building in the city center! There are so many people there. Aren\u2019t they afraid of being discovered?\u201d\u201cF*ck! They\u2019re simply afraid that we get the money, but don\u2019t give them the goods. So the most secure place is where there are many people around. If we really don\u2019t give them the goods, they will immediately cause a riot and bring the police. In that case, we can\u2019t leave either.\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t the first time. Couldn\u2019t they trust us?\u201d\u201cThe object is worth a hundred million yuan this time. It is reasonable to be careful.\u201dIn another private room, there was a laptop on the table. The screen showed the picture of the above men\u2019s room.A man sat before the laptop with earphones on. He had heard everything they had discussed.This man was Leng Shaoting.He had fine delicate features, but wore a cold expression. His eyes were as deep as the ocean with an air of power. He seemed like a king.Behind Leng Shaoting, there stood two men. Both of them stared at the screen too, but didn\u2019t hear what they had said.\u201cBoss, what\u2019s their next movement?\u201d seeing Leng Shaoting take off his earphones, a man asked.\u201cThey\u2019re going to trade at the business building in the downtown. Keep an eye on their location,\u201d Leng Shaoting said calmly with a serious look on face.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t kill them right now. He intended to use them as bait.Their head wasn\u2019t here, and the object was in the head\u2019s hands. If he killed them now, their head would be alarmed.They actually had no idea where their head was. If they had known, they would have come to him and killed him right away.\u2026The next day, Gu Ning didn\u2019t get up till 8am.Gu Ning was actually awake earlier, but she had nothing to do. The shopping center was open at eight am, so she didn\u2019t leave her warm bed till that time.Besides, Gu Ning would fly back to City F at two pm this afternoon. She had a whole morning to shop in the shopping center. She didn\u2019t need to rush at all.She also needed to sign the contract with Zhou Zhenghong in the shopping center today.The appointed time was 11am, which was a good time for lunch.Gu Ning went downstairs when she got up. She checked out afterwards.The shopping center wasn\u2019t far away. It took around 20 minutes to walk there. Thus there was no need for Gu Ning to take a taxi. She walked there directly.She had her breakfast halfway. When she finally arrived at the shopping center, it was almost 9am.Today was a Sunday. There were already many people around in the shopping center at 9am.Female clothes were on the second floor, so Gu Ning went straight to the second floor.The shopping center was so big. It seemed it would never end. Gu Ning suddenly didn\u2019t know where to start.She walked randomly to a direction scanning through the clothes on both sides. If she liked the style of a brand, she would walk inside.After a while, Gu Ning found an international designer brand. It was extremely expensive.But no matter how expensive it was, it was nothing to Gu Ning now.\u201cNice to meet you, welcome!\u201d A saleswoman immediately came to her when Gu Ning stepped in. \u201cMiss, may I help?\u201d\u201cMay I have a look at the clothes which are suitable for a woman around 40?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cSure, miss, please follow me.\u201d The saleswoman guided Gu Ning to an area.Gu Ning had a look. Nothing she liked.\u201cCould you please tell me the body type of your relative?\u201d the saleswoman inquired.\u201cShe has the same body as me. If I can wear it, it will fit her too,\u201d Gu Ning answered.Gu Ning was 167cm tall, and slim.Then, the saleswoman chose a piece of clothing showing it to Gu Ning. \u201cMiss, how about this one?\u201d\u201cWell, it looks good.\u201d Gu Ning looked at it and like it at once. It would fit Gu Man. She was about to take it and have a closer look.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73But before Gu Ning\u2019s hand touched the piece of clothing, another hand grabbed it first. \u201cI like this one. I\u2019m going to try it.\u201dIt was a woman who was at her early forties. She was in luxurious clothes, but it was only limited to her appearance. She didn\u2019t have the same good manners.A woman with good manners would never grab a thing from another person\u2019s hand.\u201cStop there,\u201d Gu Ning criticized. She was upset.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t tolerate that the woman grabbed the piece of clothing from her hand.But the woman walked away as if she hadn\u2019t heard Gu Ning\u2019s voice.Seeing that, Gu Ning frowned as a look of annoyance crossed her face. She strode ahead and stood in the woman\u2019s way.The woman almost knocked into Gu Ning.She was a little scared by Gu Ning, and shouted, \u201cWhat do you want to do, young girl? Do you want to hurt me? You should be responsible for that!\u201dThe woman\u2019s shout attracted attention from others in the shop.People immediately surrounded them to have a look.\u201cSorry, I chose this piece of clothing before you,\u201d Gu Ning said calmly. If she didn\u2019t want it, she wouldn\u2019t mind, but since she wanted it, she would never let the woman get away with it.\u201cGee, just because you choose it first doesn\u2019t mean you own it. It\u2019s in my hands now! Well, if I say I choose all the clothes here, does that then mean you won\u2019t be able to buy any of them?\u201d the lady said with disdain.\u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect you\u2019re so rich. You even want them all! Hey, have you heard what she just said? This lady said she want all the clothes here. I think the commission you\u2019ll get today will be higher than a year of commission you may get,\u201d Gu Ning said to a saleswoman. She deliberately twisted the truth.\u201cShut your mouth! I did not say that!\u201d the woman yelled at Gu Ning in anger.Though she was rich this international designer brand was super expensive, and a single piece of clothing cost dozens of thousands of yuan. All of the clothes here in the shop would be worth at least millions. The woman absolutely couldn\u2019t afford it.The crowd all knew Gu Ning was twisting the truth. No one took her words seriously.\u201cReally? Because if I choose it, I\u2019m going to buy it. And you?\u201d Gu Ning said provocatively.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The woman was mad. She also understood Gu Ning was challenging her on purpose, but she was still irritated.\u201cSorry, Madam. This young lady did choose this piece of clothing first. Would you please have a look at the other clothes?\u201d the saleswoman apologized to the woman.Hearing that, the crowd immediately understood what had happened. Everyone disliked the woman\u2019s behavior.\u201cXiao Li, Mrs. Shao is our frequent customer with a VIP silver card. She has the priority to choose first,\u201d another saleswoman who was with Mrs. Shao interrupted. She even glared at the saleswoman who was with Gu Ning.Apparently, this was nothing to do with the so-called priority to choose first. The saleswoman was just snobbish.Xiao Li, however, ignored the warning. She argued, \u201cMiss Wang, I disagree with you. The one who arrives first can choose first. Even a VIP customer can\u2019t grab the clothes from another customer.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Miss Wang was annoyed to be argued back.This Miss Wang was always snobbish, and only served the rich people.Mrs. Shao, meanwhile, was a frequent customer here. She apparently wanted to have a friendly relationship with Mrs. Shao.This was a shop of an international designer brand. The cheapest item cost dozens of thousands of yuan. Besides, a saleswoman could have 2% commission on the sales.Every time Mrs. Shao was here, she would spend at least eighty thousand yuan. The commission would be several thousand yuan!The onlookers all agreed with Xiao Li. They also felt dissatisfied.\u201cExactly, even a VIP customer can\u2019t grab the clothes from another customer. It\u2019s unfair!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not unfair. It\u2019s snobbish.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you just sell the clothes only to the VIP customers? Anyone who wants to buy clothing here must have a VIP card first.\u201d\u201cTrue!\u201dThose customers who surrounded them all criticized Miss Wang, which made her feel embarrassed, but she didn\u2019t dare to retort.Mrs. Shao, instead, felt irritated. \u201cSo what? I have enough money. I\u2019ll buy whatever I want. It\u2019s none of your business.\u201d\u201cYou can buy whatever you want, but you can\u2019t grab things from others!\u201d someone argued.\u201cExactly! This lady doesn\u2019t have manners at all,\u201d someone said.\u201cYou! Do you know who I am? How dare you to say that! I am the wife of the chairman of Zhoufu Jewelry!\u201d Mrs. Shao was annoyed. She spoke loudly about her identity.Hearing that, everyone shut their mouths at once.They obviously all knew Zhoufu Jewelry, which had at least a hundred million yuan in assets! And they just had millions in assets. No one dared to compete with Zhoufu Jewelry.Gu Ning was a little surprised. She didn\u2019t expect this woman was Shao Ping\u2019s wife.Shao Ping and Zhou Zhenghong didn\u2019t get along with each other. Gu Ning therefore disliked Shao Ping\u2019s family as well.Those onlookers were afraid of the Shao Family, but Gu Ning wasn\u2019t. She directly criticized, \u201cDo you think you can do whatever you want as the wife of the chairman of Zhoufu Jewelry?\u201d\u201cYou..\u201d Mrs. Shao didn\u2019t expect Gu Ning wasn\u2019t afraid of the Shao Family at all.But Mrs. Shao was too proud. In City F, there were many more families who were richer than them.At that moment, the store manager came over. \u201cWhat happened?\u201dBefore anyone else, Gu Ning opened her mouth with slight unkindness. \u201cNice to meet you, manager. Let me ask you a question first. Is it true that your VIP customer can directly grab the clothing from another normal customer as long as she wants to?\u201d\u201cHow is this possible? The one who arrives first chooses first. A VIP customer can only get a discount,\u201d the store manager immediately explained.Before long, he soon realized what had happened. He then turned to Miss Wang, \u201cWang Yunyun, what happened?\u201dSince there was only one VIP customer, Mrs. Shao, in the shop, and the saleswoman who was with Mrs. Shao was Wang Yunyun, the manager naturally turned to her first.Wang Yunyun had no idea the thing would end up like that. She hated Gu Ning so much, but did not dare to show it in front of the manager.Besides, this was the first time such a thing had happened. She did not know how to explain.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "Chapter 74\u201cLet me explain please. Xiao Li recommended a piece of clothing to me, and I liked it. I wanted to take a closer look, but unexpectedly, Mrs. Shao grabbed it from me. I asked her to give it back to me but she refused. Meanwhile, Wang Yunyun said that Mrs. Shao was a VIP customer and had priority to choose first,\u201d Gu Ning said.The manager changed his face immediately. He didn\u2019t doubt Gu Ning\u2019s explanation, and bashed Wang Yunyun, \u201cWang Yunyun, what\u2019s wrong with you? You\u2019ve worked here for a long time. How could you know nothing about the rules?\u201dThe manager knew Wang Yunyun was snobbish but she didn\u2019t normally cause any trouble. Thus the manager did nothing. However, the manager couldn\u2019t accept that she ruined the reputation of the shop this time.\u201cI-I\u2026\u201d Wang Yunyun suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say. She knew she had behaved in a wrong way, but everything she had done was merely for more commission.\u201cEnough, you\u2019re fired. You don\u2019t need to come to work tomorrow.\u201d The manager didn\u2019t want to waste time with Wang Yunyun. Since she had damaged the reputation of this shop, the manager had to lay her off.\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing that, Wang Yunyun was shocked. She honestly didn\u2019t know the result would be that bad.Now, she sincerely felt scared. If she was fired, she couldn\u2019t find a better job. She almost begged, \u201cManager, please give me another chance! I promise this won\u2019t happen again.\u201d\u201cWang Yunyun, it\u2019s written in the contract. Anyone who damages the reputation of this shop will be fired. I\u2019m sorry. My hands are tied,\u201d the manager said.The manager then ignored Wang Yunyun, turning to Mrs. Shao. He explained politely, \u201cMrs. Shao, we have our rules here. The one who arrives first chooses first. If you like this piece of clothing, I\u2019m afraid you need to wait until this miss doesn\u2019t want it, so please return this piece of clothing to this miss. Thank you so much.\u201dMrs. Shao of course was unhappy to do that, not only because of the piece of clothing, but also because she had been humiliated.However since the manager was here she didn\u2019t want to argue with him. She was going to buy more clothes from this shop in the future.Although the brand had many stores in City G, this store was unique with many more designs.\u201cI don\u2019t want it at all. Who cares!\u201d Mrs. Shao said with unhappiness. She directly threw the piece of clothing back at Gu Ning, then turned around and left.She had been greatly humiliated before everyone and had no reason to stay here any longer.Gu Ning took the piece of clothing right away. She really liked this one.\u201cI\u2019ll take this, and more. Please give me one of that in size L. All of them are for women around 40.\u201d Gu Ning handed the clothing to the saleswoman.Hearing that, the crowd was all surprised.This girl didn\u2019t look at the price tag at all. She must be very rich!The more a customer bought the more commission a saleswoman could get. Xiao Li was obviously happy to see that. She immediately recommended more to Gu Ning, following Gu Ning\u2019s demands.Finally, Gu Ning chose two sweaters, two pairs of pants and two long wool coats for Gu Man and Gu Qing.She of course wouldn\u2019t forget her uncle Jiang Xu and her cousin Jiang Xinyue.She bought a black Armani suit, a sweater and a pair of pants for Jiang Xu.As for Jiang Xinyue, she was still at a young age and didn\u2019t need to wear clothing from a designer brand. Gu Ning herself didn\u2019t want to do that either, so she went to another shop of a normal brand, and bought some dresses for Jiang Xinyue and herself.After buying the clothes, Gu Ning went to buy a series of skincare products for both Gu Man and Gu Qing.Then the question came to Gu Ning. What should she buy for Chu Peihan and others?Gifts were about good intentions, not the price. Moreover, except for Yu Mixi, the rest were all rich kids. It wasn\u2019t a wise choice to buy expensive gifts for them.After a while, Gu Ning decided to buy Chu Peihan and Yu Mixi each a Lanc\u00f4me perfume, which was worth more than a thousand yuan.Yu Mixi lacked of a good phone, so Gu Ning bought a phone for her. To not burden her friend, Gu Ning didn\u2019t buy an expensive one, but only spent two thousand yuan on a new phone.Since she was in a phone shop, Gu Ning bought new phones for Gu Man and the family of Gu Qing as well.As for Hao Ran and the boys, she bought four Armani wallets for them, which cost around a thousand yuan each.Gu Ning felt satisfied at the end. When her company opened, she planned to prepare some jewelry made of jade for them then.When she received Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s call, Gu Ning had almost finished her shopping. Before she left, she went to the ladies\u2019 room putting all the gifts into her telepathic eye space. It would be a lot if she carried them by hand.Their appointed place was a restaurant beside the Commercial Building. Gu Ning walked straight to the restaurant after she left the Commercial Building.She stepped into the elevator. When the door was almost closed, a man suddenly dashed in and knocked into Gu Ning by accident.\u201cOh, sorry, I\u2019m in a hurry,\u201d the man apologized.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Gu Ning said. But she felt something was strange, because when the man had hit her, she had felt there was a tough object around the man\u2019s waist. It felt like metal, and the shape was quite familiar to Gu Ning.All of a sudden, an idea dawned on Gu Ning. Was it a gun?Thinking of that, Gu Ning immediately used her Jade Eyes. It really was a gun!At the same time, Gu Ning used her Jade Eyes to scan the other four men around her. She felt nervous at once. These five men all carried a gun with them around their waist.A man with a gun normally was from the police or the army. Otherwise, they would be gangsters or criminals.Gu Ning could sense the air of violence from these men. They seemed more like gangsters or criminals.Gu Ning again used her Jade Eyes to look at the box held in a man\u2019s hand. There were bags of white powder inside.Although Gu Ning had never tried the white power herself, she immediately realized what it was according to her rich experience.She secretly inhaled deeply. These men must be here to trade.It was none of her business so Gu Ning didn\u2019t plan to get involved.The elevator stopped at the fifth floor. Gu Ning left the elevator. Coincidentally, the five men all left at the fifth floor too.Gu Ning walked to the appointed private room. To her surprise, her private room was exactly next to the private room of those men.\u201cBoss, here you are. Please have a seat.\u201d The minute Gu Ning appeared, Zhou Zhenghong immediately greeted her. He pulled out the chair for her too.\u201cBoss, I didn\u2019t know what your favorites are so I didn\u2019t order yet. Now please order the food.\u201d Zhou Zhenghong handed the menu to Gu Ning, then rang the service bell.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75When a waiter opened the door, Gu Ning glimpsed as a group of men walked by. She unexpectedly found she was familiar with the front man\u2019s figure.However when she looked over, they were gone.Gu Ning didn\u2019t know many men, and even less of them could leave an unforgettable impression on her. Thus she immediately knew who he was.The man must be the one who had given her the King\u2019s Green. What a coincidence! He was here too.Gu Ning didn\u2019t bother to think further about it. She moved her sight back to the menu. She ordered two dished then gave the menu back to Zhou Zhenghong. \u201cUncle Zhou, please help yourself and order something you like.\u201dZhou Zhenghong took the menu. He ordered two dishes as well then handed the menu to the waiter.When the waiter left, Zhou Zhenghong immediately took out a file paper-bag, giving it to Gu Ning. \u201cBoss, I\u2019ve set up the contract. Please have a look. If there is anything you think is inappropriate, I can adjust it.\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201d Gu Ning took it. She opened the paper-bag and started to read the document inside.With her powerful Jade Eyes, it was super easy for Gu Ning to read through the contract quickly, but in front of Zhou Zhenghong, Gu Ning had to pretend. She deliberately spent more time on the papers to make it seem natural.The contract only had two pages so although Gu Ning slowed down her reading pace on purpose, she still finished it in two minutes.The labor contract between Gu Ning and Zhou Zhenghong said that Zhou Zhenghong was the executive director of the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company. He had absolute right of discourse. The registered capital of the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company was a hundred million yuan. In addition to the monthly salary, Zhou Zhenghong also owned 20% of the shares of the Jade Beauty Jewelry Company.\u201cWell, I think it\u2019s good,\u201d Gu Ning said. She signed her name in Party A, and then handed it to Zhou Zhenghong. Zhou Zhenghong also signed his name.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t help using her Jade Eyes to see into the private room next door. She saw those men that she saw in the elevator and another group of men sat across a table. There were two black boxes on the table in front of the two groups.They were in a luxurious restaurant with great insulation so she couldn\u2019t hear anything because they weren\u2019t speaking loudly.She could only see what they were doing.They opened the boxes. One of them was full of bags of white powder, while the other was filled with piles of bills and gold bars.Apparently, they were in the middle of a deal.Although Gu Ning knew they were doing something illegal, she knew she shouldn\u2019t get involved.Moreover, there were at least 10 men with guns. Gu Ning wasn\u2019t powerful enough to fight against them.Gu Ning brought her sight back, lifting the tea cup to drink a sip.However, in the private room adjacent to the private room next door, there were three men. One of them was Leng Shaoting.Leng Shaoting was dressed in black clothes. He was tall and expressionless.He was wearing earphones listening to the sound from the adjacent room and was monitoring the conversation.Meanwhile, a young man walked over, talking to Leng Shaoting, \u201cCaptain, except for us and the enemies, there are also people in another private room on this floor. It\u2019s room No.3 which is right next to our enemies\u2019 room. I\u2019ve already informed the manager to get them to leave.\u201d\u201cGreat,\u201d Leng Shaoting answered lightly and said nothing else.Because they didn\u2019t know their enemies\u2019 appointed place beforehand, they weren\u2019t well prepared in advance. They could only check the surrounding situation after the appointed place had been confirmed. Even the bug was secretly set by one of Leng Shaoting\u2019s men who had disguised himself as a waiter.Knock, knock.At that moment, the door of Gu Ning\u2019s private room was knocked on and was then pushed open.Gu Ning though it was the waiter; but to her surprise, two men who were around 30 walked in. Both Gu Ning and Zhou Zhenghong frowned a little.One of the men was full of regrets saying, \u201cNice to meet you, miss and sir. I\u2019m the hotel manager. I\u2019m so sorry to bother you for a special condition.\u201dThe man with the hotel manager walked in front of Gu Ning. He took out a document and handed it to Gu Ning. He said, \u201cNice to meet you both. This is my certificate as a military officer. Our military is currently carrying out a task on this floor. For your safety, I hope you can immediately move to a private room upstairs. Sorry about that.\u201dKnowing that, Zhou Zhenghong was completely shocked while Gu Ning was merely a little surprised. It must have something to do with the people in the next room.However could the man be from the military? Well, the man did look like a military man.\u201cSure.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to be involved either. She answered then left with Zhou Zhenghong, following the hotel manager and the military officer.However just as they left the room, the two men standing outside room No.4 immediately looked over. The hotel manager suddenly panicked. His face turned pale at once because he clearly knew that the suspect was right in that private room.Both Gu Ning and the officer knew that something bad might happen. The reaction of the hotel manager was likely to attract the attention of those men. The officer immediately took a step forward and blocked the hotel manager. He gave the manager a warning look.However the two people who were outside had already seen the manager\u2019s face. They sensed something must be wrong right away. They called out, \u201cWait.\u201dThe hotel manager trembled, but because of the officer\u2019s warning look, he forced himself to calm down and immediately put on a formulaic smile. \u201cNice to meet you sir. What can I do for you?\u201d He asked the person who called him.The two men exchanged a knowing look, then walked towards them.Both Gu Ning and the officer were alert. They knew things could go wrong. But they were afraid to raise suspicion, so they decided to temporarily stand still.The two men walked over, then immediately took out guns aiming at them. \u201cGet in!\u201d they snapped quietly.The hotel manager and Zhou Zhenghong\u2019s faces immediately turned pale. They were trembling from the terror.Gu Ning and the military officer stayed calm instead; but again to not raise suspicion, they cooperated well and showed fear on their faces.They were all forced back into the private room.Room No.5 was where Leng Shaoting stayed. He had set cameras outside, so he was able to see what was going on.\u201cCaptain, what should we do? They\u2019re so sensitive!\u201d a man said worriedly.\u201cBe patient,\u201d Leng Shaoting said.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t miss the relatively smaller figure among them. He was a little upset and uneasy. It seemed that he was concerned about her safety.In room No.3.\u201cYou just saw us. Why did you look so scared?\u201d a suspect asked the hotel manager. He recognized the hotel manager, so he was particularly sensitive.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76\u201cUm, nothing,\u201d the hotel manager denied. He tried to stay calm, but failed. The two men definitely didn\u2019t believe him.\u201cTell them we have a problem here,\u201d one of the men said to the other. The other man then turned to walk out.Gu Ning looked at the man\u2019s gun. He hadn\u2019t cocked it yet. If Gu Ning went to grab his gun, there was no chance for the man to shoot. In other words, it was safe for Gu Ning to do so.Gu Ning gave the military officer a knowing look. The latter immediately understood.The military officer was amazed too. This young girl wasn\u2019t afraid at all! She even wanted to act first.To be honest, the military officer didn\u2019t trust Gu Ning\u2019s ability. He was a little hesitant, but when he saw Gu Ning\u2019s undeniable look, he immediately felt more confident.Therefore, he nodded slightly as affirmation.The girl dared to grab the gun directly from a man, which showed she had both courage and ability.Gu Ning then started to act. She came to the man like lightning and grabbed his hand, with a snap sound, the man\u2019s hand was broken.Meanwhile, the military officer pulled his gun out, shooting at the other man.Before the man could make a sound, Gu Ning immediately stuffed his mouth with tissues. She then raised her hand and slashed it toward his neck. The man immediately lost consciousness.Because the officer\u2019s gun was equipped with a silencer, it did not make any sound. He accurately shot the other man in the head. The man then silently fell onto the ground.It all happened too fast to be noticed. The two men still didn\u2019t realize what had happened before they were both killed.Both the hotel manager and Zhou Zhenghong rounded their eyes in shock. They felt like they were in a dream.The military officer instead was also surprised by Gu Ning. He didn\u2019t expect this young girl could be that powerful. She was even as good and swift as he was.He had been in the army for at least 10 years as a senior special commander, and had been through at least 10 years of devil training. What kind of training had this girl been through? The military officer thought to himself.Although he wondered, he didn\u2019t ask. It was none of his business after all.Besides, he had a bigger fish to fry now.\u201cYou all must leave now!\u201d the military officer said.\u201cIt\u2019s too late,\u201d Gu Ning said. She saw someone going out from the private room next door.As soon as the man came out, he would find the bodies.At that moment, Gu Ning ran out before she could say another word. The rest of the people in the room were all surprised. They had no idea what she was going to do.Zhou Zhenghong wanted to have a look, because he was worried about Gu Ning\u2019a safety. However he was stopped by the military officer. Instead, the military officer followed her.Leng Shaoting, on the other side, noticed Gu Ning was coming out.Seeing Gu Ning is out, they knew the people in private room No. 3 were fine now; but why was Gu Ning rushing out?Amid all the confusion, Gu Ning dashed to the door of private room No.4. At the same time, the door was pushed open and a man walked out.Before the man noticed Gu Ning coming, Gu Ning hit him with great force. The man lost consciousness at short notice and fell onto the ground. Gu Ning then grabbed his gun.Watching that, Leng Shaoting and his people who were staring at the screen, as well as the military officer who followed Gu Ning out were all shocked.They now understood why Gu Ning said that it was too late.But how could she know that there was a man coming out?Knowing that Gu Ning was safe, Leng Shaoting was relieved. Now it was time for them to act.Three of them walked out immediately.Gu Ning\u2019s gaze met Leng Shaoting\u2019s eyes coincidentally. Seeing his handsome cold face, Gu Ning\u2019s heart skipped a beat. But she knew it wasn\u2019t the appropriate time to appreciate the handsome man.\u201cGet back to the private room,\u201d Leng Shaoting said to Gu Ning.\u201cI can protect myself,\u201d Gu Ning replied. She wouldn\u2019t go back.Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He was apparently dissatisfied but he didn\u2019t say anything more. He was confident that as long as he was here, he could protect the young girl. Immediately after that, Leng Shaoting and his people ran into private room No.4. A round of gunshots followed.Once the gunshots sounded, the whole building was lost in terror. People ran away, trying to hide. The building even shook a little.Zhou Zhenghong and the hotel manager were scared and hid themselves directly under the table.Zhou Zhenghong was very worried about Gu Ning, but he did not dare to go out. Moreover, he didn\u2019t go out because of Gu Ning\u2019s warning.Before long, the gunshots stopped.Meanwhile, the sirens also sounded downstairs, but the police were notified in advance and cleaned up the scene.Although Gu Ning didn\u2019t walk into the room, she knew clearly what was happening inside because she used her Jade Eyes.Leng Shaoting only had three men with him, while the other party had seven or eight men. But for the suspect, the appearance of Leng Shaoting and his men was so unexpected. Thus when the other party reacted, it was already too late and they were all killedAnd Leng Shaoting as well his men, were all safe.They were amazingly powerful.Although the mission was completed, Leng Shaoting and his men didn\u2019t leave right away. They were waiting for the police so that they could hand over.Gu Ning turned around to go into her private room. She told Zhou Zhenghong and the hotel manager it was alright now.\u201cBoss, are you alright?\u201d Zhou Zhenghong heard Gu Ning\u2019s voice. He immediately moved out from beneath the table, along with the hotel manager.Seeing that, Gu Ning felt like laughing, but she had no intention to make fun of them.It had been a gun war, and it was totally understandable that people got scared.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cManager, I suppose you need to close the restaurant for a while because of what has just happened. We won\u2019t bother you here,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSure-sure. I\u2019m so sorry about that, miss. Oh, thank you so much for rescuing me.\u201d The manager didn\u2019t forget that Gu Ning had saved his life.\u201cI was saving myself too,\u201d Gu Ning said. She wasn\u2019t being modest, she simply told the truth.Then, Gu Ning together with Zhou Zhenghong, who hadn\u2019t recovered from the shock yet, went outside.\u201cPlease wait.\u201dBefore they went far away, Leng Shaoting stopped them.\u201cSir, what\u2019s up?\u201d Gu Ning turned around. She looked at Leng Shaoting walking to her with her big beautiful eyes. Her voice sounded charming. All the men were softened.Leng Shaoting\u2019s heart skipped a beat as well.\u00a0This girl is so adorable!But the feeling quickly went away.Leng Shaoting came to Gu Ning, reaching out his hand. \u201cNon-military or police personnel are not allowed to hold guns privately. Once found, it must be handled as illegal behavior.\u201dEveryone was shocked.What? This young girl had a gun?Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77They had noticed that Gu Ning had grabbed the suspect\u2019s gun, but didn\u2019t hand it over.However Gu Ning left a good impression on them given she had been of great help, so they didn\u2019t think further about it. They believed the young girl was simply curious about a gun.Gu Ning was reluctant to do it at first, but then she resignedly took a gun out of her backpack throwing it back to Leng Shaoting. \u201cCan\u2019t hide it from you, ha?\u201d she complained.Gu Ning didn\u2019t have chance to put the gun into the room of her telepathic eyes, so if he wanted to search her body for it, she couldn\u2019t hide it. Thus she had to give it to him.\u201cUncle Zhou, let\u2019s go,\u201d Gu Ning called Zhou Zhenghong who was distracted.Zhou Zhenghong immediately followed her.When Gu Ning disappeared at the end of the passage, Leng Shaoting found the suspect who was lying on the ground in private room No. 3. He sensed something wasn\u2019t right. He walked over and searched the suspect\u2019s body.Nothing.Indeed, Gu Ning carried another gun with her, which belonged to that suspect.If Gu Ning hadn\u2019t had another gun with her, she wouldn\u2019t have been willing to give the first gun to Leng Shaoting.Leng Shaoting was annoyed, but not upset. It seemed that he trusted her and believed that she wouldn\u2019t do anything harmful so he didn\u2019t chase her, but instead focused on what had just happened in the hotel.After all, he knew she was a student from the No. 3 High School in City F. He could always find her later.\u201cBoss, you\u2019re so awesome!\u201d When they left the hotel, Zhou Zhenghong finally recovered from the shock. He now admired Gu Ning more than ever.Gu Ning was merely an 18-year-old girl!\u201cIf I couldn\u2019t do anything, I wouldn\u2019t dare to walk around freely,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cRight,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong agreed with Gu Ning. He had always believed that Gu Ning wasn\u2019t just an ordinary girl with excellent accuracy on stone gambling. However today he had been amazed again.\u201cOh, boss, what do you want to eat? We haven\u2019t eaten yet,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong asked.Gu Ning though for a while, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s go have hot pot!\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong answered. They went to a food center afterwards.After the meal, it was already 12:30 pm. Gu Ning\u2019s flight would take off at 2 pm so she needed to leave for the airport.Before she left, Gu Ning told Zhou Zhenghong to buy a car for convenience. He was allowed to choose a car which was worth within a million yuan.After that, Gu Ning left.On her way to the airport, Gu Ning thought it would be faster to buy a house if she knew someone who was powerful. Among the people Gu Ning knew in City F, only An Qian and Qin Yifan were reliable.Gu Ning\u2019s first choice was Qin Yifan. She didn\u2019t know An Qian\u2019s background and wasn\u2019t sure whether An Qian had the ability to help her.Thus, Gu Ning called Qin Yifan.At the same time, Qin Yifan was sitting in a caf\u00e9 with Li Zhenyu.Qin Yifan was a mature and stable man, but once it involved Gu Ning, Qin Yifan would suddenly be lively.When Gu Ning\u2019s call came in, Qin Yifan was delighted with a smile at the corners of his lips. \u201cGu Ning, what\u2019s up?\u201d He even sounded sweet.Li Zhenyu witnessed all his reactions and felt uneasy.Did Qin Yifan like Gu Ning that much?Although he hated Gu Ning, he had to admit Gu Ning wasn\u2019t ordinary.She had good appearance, and unbearable luck, as well as talent on stone gambling.Moreover, Li Zhenzhen had come home in shock yesterday. He then knew Li Zhenzhen had hired a bunch of gangster to teach Gu Ning a lesson.However unexpectedly, Gu Ning had been totally fine. She even had called and threatened Li Zhenzhen with Liu\u2019s phone.At first Li Zhenyu thought Liu must have been bought by Gu Ning with money. Although he had connection with Liu, they weren\u2019t close. Besides, Liu was a gangster who would do anything for money. It was possible that he had betrayed Li Zhenzhen for money.But he had checked it himself this morning. Liu and his men had been injured by Gu Ning, and all of them were in the hospital now.Li Zhenyu had totally been shocked.It was beyond his imagination that a teenage girl could be so powerful and difficult to deal with, but he was still confused about Gu Ning\u2019s background.If she was from a common family, he wouldn\u2019t care about her at all, but if she was from a powerful rich family, he would have to have a second thought for the good of his family.Li Zhenyu decided to investigate Gu Ning first.Luckily, even though Gu Ning knew Li Zhenzhen was behind those gangsters, she had no proof, so Li Zhenyu didn\u2019t need to worry that Gu Ning would sue his sister.\u201cWell, I want to buy two well-decorated houses in Fenghua Luxury Mansion. Do you know anyone who can get it done as soon as possible?\u201d Gu Ning asked.Qin Yifan happily replied, \u201cYou\u2019ve called the right person! I have a friend who is actually the sales manager of Fenghua Luxury Mansion. I\u2019ll call him later to help you pick the best location and give you the biggest discount.\u201dQin Yifan knew Gu Ning had over a hundred million yuan of wealth, so he didn\u2019t feel surprised when she said she was going to buy houses in Fenghua Luxury Mansion.Besides, he felt honored that Gu Ning turned to him for help.\u201cGreat, thank you so much.\u201d Gu Ning accepted Qin Yifan\u2019s kindness. She didn\u2019t care about a discount actually, but she wouldn\u2019t reject it either.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll send his number to you once it\u2019s done,\u201d Qin Yifan said.\u201cThanks,\u201d Gu Ning said. When she was about to hang up, another thing dawned on her. \u201cOh, I almost forget. I have an emerald with me now, and I want to make some jewelry for my family with it. I plan to give it to Yicui Jade-store to help me with that when you\u2019re back in City F.\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019ve cut out more jade? What is its type?\u201d Qin Yifan was so excited to hear about the jade that he almost jumped up from his seat.No one could blame him. Gu Ning had already cut out two high-level jade yesterday, which was amazing. But she even cut out more later.She wanted to make jewelry for her family with it, so it must be a high-level jade!\u201cYou\u2019ll find out when you\u2019re back. Of course it isn\u2019t ordinary.\u201d Gu Ning deliberately kept it a secret.But for Qin Yifan, this was simply a bucket of cold water splashing down on him, and his excitement was immediately ruined. Instead, he was super curious now. He complained, \u201cHow can you do that to me! It\u2019s torture! I can\u2019t wait to see what type it is. I\u2019ll be back tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cYou better mind your own on-going business first! Alright, I\u2019m almost at the airport, bye-bye,\u201d Gu Ning said.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78\u201cTake care then.\u201d Qin Yifan knew that Gu Ning was going back today, so he wasn\u2019t surprised that she was in the airport now.After Qin Yifan hung up, Li Zhenyu asked him with a meaningful look, \u201cYour attitude towards the girl Gu Ning is different. Tell me the truth. Do you like her?\u201dQin Yifan was struck dumb. He did appreciate Gu Ning, but he didn\u2019t know whether he liked Gu Ning himself.He just felt happy and relaxed whenever he was with her.\u201cI have no idea.\u201d Qin Yifan gave a vague answer because he truly didn\u2019t know.However, his vague answer showed that he might actually like her.Although Li Zhenyu was disappointed to hear that, he said nothing.He clearly knew that Qin Yifan treated Li Zhenzhen as his younger sister. He wasn\u2019t willing to marry her, but Li Zhenyu still had hope.Qin Yifan\u2019s parents liked Li Zhenzhen. They all hoped for Qin Yifan to marry Li Zhenzhen, but they would also respect Qin Yifan\u2019s choice.Therefore, the Li Family couldn\u2019t urge Qin Yifan to marry Li Zhenzhen for the good of their relationship.Qin Yifan then immediately called his friend to help Gu Ning.At the same time, what had happened in the restaurant was aired on TV. People all felt surprised.However, the news reports didn\u2019t mention Gu Ning.Although Gu Ning had helped a lot in the gun war, Leng Shaoting was afraid that she would be revenged by other gangsters, so he ordered them to not mention her name.At 3:15 pm, the plane landed at the airport of City F. Gu Ning checked her phone and saw that she received a message from Qin Yifan.Qin Yifan told her that he had settled everything. His friend\u2019s name and number were attached to the message. The man was called Wei Zhirui.Gu Ning sent a message back to thank him.When Gu Ning walked out of the airport, she called Gu Man. She told her mother she was back, but she planned to take a look at the houses before going back to the hospital.Gu Ning took a taxi heading straight to Fenghua Luxury Mansion.On her way, she called Wei Zhirui to politely tell him she was coming and her intention.Wei Zhirui of course wouldn\u2019t reject such a profitable deal. Besides, Gu Ning was introduced by his good friend so Wei Zhirui naturally showed his passion.\u201cNice to meet you. May I ask, are you Miss Gu?\u201dOnce Gu Ning walked into the sales apartment, a man who was around 30 years old came to greet her.Wei Zhirui already knew that Gu Ning was a beautiful 18-year-old girl; and there wasn\u2019t any other young girls around. He was almost 100% sure that he recognized the right person when Gu Ning stepped in.Although he knew the buyer was a young girl, he was still greatly surprised when he met Gu Ning in person. The girl was so young, and even wanted to buy two houses!However, since she was introduced by Qin Yifan, she must be super rich.Anyway, Wei Zhirui would be polite as long as a customer walked in, no matter if he or she was rich or not. That was the basic qualification of a worker in the service industry.\u201cI am Gu Ning. You must be Mr. Wei!\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cYes, I\u2019m Wei Zhirui. Nice to meet you, Miss Gu. Welcome to Fenghua Luxury Mansion,\u201d Wei Zhirui said to Gu Ning.\u201cMiss Gu, Yifan told me about your requests. However, I think it\u2019s better to introduce the environment of Fenghua Luxury Mansion to you first. Please follow me.\u201dWei Zhirui guided Gu Ning to the exhibition hall, and said, \u201cFenghua Luxury Mansion is the most high-end residential area in City F. The location is very good. It\u2019s close to the downtown, but it\u2019s quiet. There is a medium-sized shopping mall across the road from Fenghua Luxury Mansion. There are also food supermarkets, clothing, furniture and so forth inside. There are also many banks around so it\u2019s very convenient to live here.\u201d\u201cThe facilities, preservation and property service of Fenghua Luxury Mansion are all of high quality. Fenghua Luxury Mansion is planned in the form of a district within a central district. Each district forms a community with between four and eight buildings with independent gates. The residents need a card to get in and an outsider needs to get the guidance or permission of a resident here. Only after the security guard is informed can the outsider come in. Of course, it is possible that someone could secretly follow a resident and get in, but if anyone directly affects you, you can immediately call the security room. The security guard will take him or her out as fast as possible. There are small squares, greenery, swimming pools, leisure bars, gyms and small food supermarkets inside as well.\u201d\u201cMiss Gu, if you want well-decorated houses, the choices of location and floor are limited, because we only have three floors with well-decorated houses in each building. The floors of each building are different. There are six households on each floor, two with four-bedrooms, two with three-bedrooms and two with two-bedrooms. If you want a three-bedroom house, there are two best choices available. One is in the E zone, and the other is in the G zone. Each zone is a community of four or five buildings. If you come in from the gate and walk at a general speed, it only takes 10 to 20 minutes to arrive. We do however have sightseeing cars around here. If you take the car, it only takes three minutes.\u201dWei Zhirui then pointed out the location for Gu Ning. The houses were in the front half of the district, and it was indeed a good position.\u201cThere are five buildings in E zone, and three three-bedroom houses in building E3. However, they aren\u2019t on the same floor. Each house is 120 square meters big. There are also four buildings in G zone with three three-bedroom houses in building G2. Two of them are on the ninth floor and the size is relatively larger. It is 160 square meters big with an indoor garden, three rooms and one living room, one study, one kitchen and three bathrooms. There is a large balcony in the living room. Here is a model of the apartment. Please have a look.\u201dSaying that, Wei Zhirui guided Gu Ning to the models area.Before Gu Ning saw the size of the houses, she had already planned to buy one that was 160 square meters. Although she felt it was a little large for her and her mother alone, fortunately, there were two houses on the same floor; it\u2019ll be very lively if the family of Gu Qing also moved in.Gu Ning was very satisfied with the houses that were 160 square meters, but before she decided she wanted to have a look at its decoration first.Although Fenghua Luxury Mansion was a high-end district, and its decoration was also of high quality. It was better to have a look in person first.They took the sightseeing car, and arrived within three minutes.It could be faster if no one got on and off on the way.They then took the elevator to the ninth floor. Wei Zhirui opened the door for Gu Ning.Once they walked in, an indoor garden came into view. There was a shoe cabinet beside the door. A tea table and fish tanks were in the garden. There was however no fish in the fish tank because the house wasn\u2019t occupied.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: 79In the living room, there was a chandelier, sofa, coffee table, carpet, TV cabinet and a TV. The TV was 50 inches large.In the dining room, there was a dining table and chairs.In the kitchen, there was a refrigerator, oven, gas stove, range hood, pots and pans. All of them had been packed. They were all brand new. The only things missing were rice, oil, salt and vinegar.There was also a balcony with a fully automatic washing machine in the kitchen.In the study, there were bookcases, a desk, a small sofa with three seats and a small coffee table.In the master bedroom, there was a bathroom, cloakroom, bed, wardrobe and a dressing table.There were also a toilet, bed, wardrobe, a desk and a chair in the second bedroom.In the third bedroom, there were a bed, wardrobe, a desk and a chair, but there wasn\u2019t a bathroom.The house had been cleaned often, so it was clean and bright, without dust.However, if they wanted to move in, it had to be cleaned once more.\u201cMiss Gu, rest assured. You are a friend of Yifan\u2019s so I would never lie to you. The decoration here is absolutely high-standard, and the quality is excellent too. All the furniture has certificates, invoices and warranty cards. You don\u2019t need to worry at all,\u201d Wei Zhirui said with confidence.Actually, Gu Ning knew they were of good quality simply by looking at it and touching it.They went to the second house later. It was the same. Gu Ning then decided to buy those two houses.Although Wei Zhirui knew it was highly possible that Gu Ning would buy the houses, he was still thrilled to hear the affirmative answer.Although Wei Zhirui and Qin Yifan were friends, he wasn\u2019t from a rich family. He earned everything by working hard. Once he sold a house, he could earn a commission. How could he not be happy?Wei Zhirui became the sales manager of Fenghua Luxury Mansion, which was a big real estate company, at a young age. He was a very capable man.\u201cMiss Gu, do you want to pay by full payment or instalments?\u201d Wei Zhirui asked.\u201cFull payment,\u201d Gu Ning answered.Wei Zhirui was shocked again.Full payment?Two 160 square meter, big well-decorated houses in the front position cost around thirteen million yuan.This girl must be super rich!To be honest, although Fenghua Luxury Mansion was a high-end residential area and most of the people who lived here were rich, many of them had paid by instalments. There were two thousand households in Fenghua Luxury Mansion currently, but only dozens of them had paid by full payment.Even those who had dozens of millions of yuan of wealth had paid by instalments.The sales people could extract the commission from the interest, and the total commission was higher than that of a full payment.But no one knew how long they could keep their job. Therefore, it was better to have a total commission at once.\u201cThe owners of those two houses won\u2019t be the same person. I only brought a copy of one of their ID cards with me, so I\u2019ll buy one first, and pay the deposit for the other. I\u2019ll pay the full amount tomorrow,\u201d Gu Ning said\u201cNo problem,\u201d Wei Zhirui answered. He then helped Gu Ning with the legal procedure.Gu Ning had already prepared a copy of Gu Man\u2019s ID card. She only wrote Gu Man\u2019s name on the property ownership certificate.Because the first house was paid by one-time payment, only the copy of an ID card was needed. The second one was a little troublesome. Since it was a house bought after marriage, it was necessary to have a household register, an ID card and a marriage certificate.Gu Ning would not only write Gu Qing\u2019s name on the property ownership certificate because of their intimate relation. She also knew her uncle Jiang Xu was a good man, who treated Gu Qing and Jiang Xinyue very well.Thus, Gu Ning didn\u2019t regard Jiang Xu as an outsider.\u201cMiss Gu, both of your well-decorated houses are 165 square meters big. The total price is 13.6 million yuan. After the biggest discount I can give you, it is 12.92 million yuan in total,\u201d Wei Zhirui said.\u201cThanks a lot,\u201d Gu Ning thanked him with sincerity.Gu Ning knew the man had done his best.And she did appreciate what the man had done for her.Besides, Wei Zhirui probably could only gain a hundred thousand yuan from that deal.\u201cThe total amount of a house is 6.45 million yuan, and the deposit for the other one is a hundred thousand yuan. Thus Miss Gu, you need to pay 6.55 million yuan now,\u201d Wei Zhirui said.When Wei Zhirui guided Gu Ning to the counter, the cashier was shocked.What? Full payment? The buyer must be super rich!Before long, Wei Zhirui finished all the legal documents. Gu Ning already had the key of the house which she and Gu Man would move into today.Gu Man had actually already recovered and was ready to leave the hospital.Before Gu Ning left, she left a key with Wei Zhirui. She asked him to help her find an hourly worker. She wanted the house to be cleaned once more before she moved in.It could of course be handled easily by Wei Zhirui.Once Gu Ning was gone, the news that Wei Zhirui had sold a house paid by full payment exploded in the entire sales hall. They all asked Wei Zhirui how he did it.Wei Zhirui didn\u2019t keep it a secret. He told his colleagues the buyer was a friend of his friend.He then told them the buyer planned to buy two houses by full payment today, but she didn\u2019t have all the documents with her, so she paid the deposit first. She would come back tomorrow.Everyone was shocked again.That girl must be super rich!It was already 5:30 pm when Gu Ning left. She immediately called Gu Man to invite the family of Gu Qing. She intended to have lunch with all of them to celebrate.Coincidentally, the family of Gu Qing was in the hospital with Gu Man today.Therefore, Gu Ning decided to go directly to the hospital.She planned to visit Gu Man first, then buy some daily necessities on the way back.She took a taxi to the hospital.Fenghua Luxury Mansion wasn\u2019t far away from the hospital. It only took a dozen minutes to arrive at the hospital if there was no traffic jam, but it was rush hour now so it took Gu Ning almost half an hour.When she arrived at the hospital, she called An Qian. She told An Qian her mother was about to leave, and she also wanted to invite An Qian for a meal once she was free. Gu Ning also wanted to pay An Qian back for the admission fee.An Qian refused to take Gu Ning\u2019s money. It wasn\u2019t much to her. Besides, Gu Ning had saved her life, which was much more priceless.But she accepted having a meal with Gu Ning. She honestly wanted to make friends with Gu Ning.Gu Ning didn\u2019t argue with An Qian on the phone. She was going to pay her back anyway.Gu Ning finished the discharge procedure before she went upstairs.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "Chapter 80Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsIn the patient room, Gu Ning greeted the family of Gu Qing one by one.Gu Ning was happy to see that her mother had gained some weight and was more energetic than before.Gu Man had told Gu Qing and Jiang Xu that Gu Ning had been out to find a house.\u201cNingning, have you found a house?\u201d Gu Qing asked Gu Ning when she came in. If Gu Ning failed to find a house, Gu Qing was determined to let them stay with her family so that they would have more time to find a place to live in later.\u201cI\u2019ve founded it,\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cReally? That\u2019s good. Where is the house? Is it safe? How much does it cost a month?\u201d Gu Qing asked.Gu Ning felt contented receiving the kindness and care from Gu Qing. She smiled with warmth. \u201cIt\u2019s around the Youyi Road. It\u2019s safe and the price is acceptable.\u201dGu Ning didn\u2019t tell them details. It wasn\u2019t the appropriate time.Knowing that Gu Ning was going to buy instead of rent a house, Gu Man was surprised.Youyi Road was close to the downtown with more blocks than Fenghua Luxury Mansion. Gu Man didn\u2019t think of Fenghua Luxury Mansion of course, but the rest of the houses there weren\u2019t cheap either.A house would cost at least two million yuan.Didn\u2019t Ningning still plan to allot some money to investment?Gu Man always believed that Gu Ning would buy a house in a remote area at the price of one million yuan at the most.Gu Ning gave her mother a comforting glance. She didn\u2019t want to explain everything to them now.Although Gu Man was surprised, she was also happy to see that Gu Ning could make decisions on her own.Gu Ning then added, \u201cI\u2019ve already finished the discharge documents. Now let\u2019s pack up and go home! Let\u2019s go celebrate!\u201d\u201cOh, Gu Man can leave now? That\u2019s very good! We must celebrate!\u201d Everyone was delighted to know that Gu Ning had found a house, and that Gu Man was ready to leave the hospital.Gu Qing thought that Gu Ning and Gu Man were probably on a tight budget now, after they had paid the admission and the VIP patient room fee. Thus she invited them on her own initiative. \u201cThis meal is on me. No one is going to compete with me for that.\u201d\u201cNo,no. This meal has to be on me. Now, you all need to be mentally prepared, because I have some very important news to tell you later,\u201d Gu Ning said seriously.\u201cWhat news?\u201d Gu Qing and Jiang Xu were a little worried to see Gu Ning wearing a serious face.However, although Gu Ning put on a serious face, nothing was actually wrong. Thus Gu Qing and Jiang Xu were slightly relaxed.Only Gu Man knew what was going on, but if Gu Man had known that Gu Ning had bought two houses in the most expensive area in City F, she would have been completely shocked.As for Jiang Xinyue, she was curious, but didn\u2019t think further.\u201cLet\u2019s go home now. I\u2019ll tell you all later,\u201d Gu Ning urged.Since Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to tell them now, they all closed their mouths and started to pack up.\u201cNingning, who sent those to you? They\u2019re too many, and must be expensive!\u201d Gu Qing didn\u2019t discover those gifts that Gu Ning had received till now.\u201cSome are from my schoolmates, some are from a doctor who is my friend in this hospital,\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cSchoolmates? They must be super rich!\u201d Gu Qing said with surprise.Gu Ning didn\u2019t say anything else.They went downstairs and Gu Ning called a taxi on the way out.Before they even left the hospital, the car was already waiting for them outside.When the car stopped across Fenghua Luxury Mansion, everyone was amazed by its luxurious buildings. They almost believed that it was where they were going to move in, but no one actually believed it. It was beyond their imagination that Gu Ning was able to buy or rent a house here.However, there were only tall buildings, shopping malls or hotels around except for those luxurious residential houses.Thinking of that, Gu Qing asked, \u201cNingning, are there any houses to rent here?\u201dEven Gu Man didn\u2019t understand why Gu Ning brought them here.\u201cWe lack many daily necessities now so let\u2019s go to the supermarket first,\u201d Gu Ning said.Hearing that, everyone understood immediately.Gu Qing said, \u201cOh, right! You just rented a new house. There must be nothing inside.\u201dThen, the group of them walked into the supermarket.They mainly bought cookers, ingredients and food, as well as some other daily necessities.Gu Ning went to buy three sheet sets herself.They couldn\u2019t buy everything they needed in such a short time, so they only bought everything they needed for today.Gu Man had already quit her job. Gu Ning planned to give her a credit card with a million yuan limit later, so that she could buy anything she wanted.When they went to pay, the rest all waited outside while Gu Ning settled the bill. No one else knew how much they had spent.All of them then left the supermarket with large and small bags.Since only Gu Ning knew the direction, everyone followed her, but when they got to the gate of Fenghua Luxury Mansion, everyone stopped and rounded theirs eyes in shock.\u201cNingning, are you going to tell us your house is right in there?\u201d Gu Qing couldn\u2019t believe her eyes.\u201cNingning, the house price here is so expensive, you\u2026\u201d Even Gu Man couldn\u2019t stay quiet now. She was confused.\u201cPlease let\u2019s not talk outside. Let\u2019s get in first! I promise I\u2019ll tell you everything when we\u2019re at home,\u201d Gu Ning said in an undeniable tone.The rest were all nervous following Gu Ning to walk inside afterwards.Even though they walked in, they still couldn\u2019t believe it was true.They got into a sightseeing car, and all were amazed by the scene. They never would have believed that they would have a chance to step in Fenghua Luxury Mansion in their entire lifetime!The car stopped at G zone. They all got out and walked inside.On the way, the rest all had countless questions in mind, especially the family of Gu Qing. However, they knew Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t say anything till they were home.They went to the ninth floor by elevator. Gu Ning pulled out the key and opened the door of her house. It was No. 901. Once the door opened, they all stepped inside.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee TranslationsWhen they saw the spacious rooms and the elegant decoration inside, everyone was stunned again. They even didn\u2019t dare to walk inside, but stopped at the door.They had actually been to such a spacious and well-decorated house before.It was Gu Qinxiang\u2019s house.However, when they had gone to his place, they had felt very nervous and had no idea how to behave.If they had had another choice, they wouldn\u2019t have gone to Gu Qinxiang\u2019s place.Of course, Gu Qinxiang also disliked them.\u201cPlease feel at home. Don\u2019t be nervous at all. Come on in! I\u2019ll tell you everything.\u201d Gu Ning put down all the stuff. She pulled Gu Man and Gu Qing while walking to the living room.Gu Qing was still a little nervous, while Gu Man relaxed a lot, because she knew that her daughter had bought this house.Although she didn\u2019t know why Gu Ning would buy such an expensive house, she chose to believe in her daughter.Jiang Xu and Jiang Xinyue followed slowly.\u201cPlease have a seat,\u201d Gu Ning said, but some of them still stood. It seemed like they were afraid to dirt the sofa.\u201cHave a seat please.\u201d Gu Man sat down calmly.They all sat down afterwards, but felt uneasy.\u201cAunt, uncle, do you still remember what I said last Sunday? If I become rich, I will definitely let you live a good life,\u201d Gu Ning asked.Hearing that, both Gu Qing and Jiang Xu kept staring at Gu Ning. They didn\u2019t realize what had happened.Apparently, they remembered Gu Ning\u2019s words, but what did Gu Ning\u2019s words have to do with what was happening now?They couldn\u2019t believe that Gu Ning would become rich within such a short time.Therefore, Gu Ning told them what she had told Gu Man. The family of Gu Qing were all amazed by the story.She had rescued a man, gotten ten million yuan, and even planned to run a business?\u201cI\u2019ve said it before. Once I\u2019m rich, I will definitely let you all live a good life. Now it\u2019s time to fulfill my promise. I bought two houses of the same size actually. The other one is right across from this one.\u201d\u201cThis one is for me and my mother. The opposite one is for your whole family. Since I didn\u2019t tell you in advance, I couldn\u2019t get all the required documents. Please bring your household register and marriage certificate here tomorrow. After we finish the procedure, you can move in directly. The house is well-decorated as well. All you need to buy are daily necessities,\u201d Gu Ning said.A long, long while later.\u201cAm-am I in a dream?\u201d Gu Qing asked. It was so hard to believe it. She immediately pinched Jiang Xu\u2019s thigh with great force. Jiang Xu shouted in pain.Gu Qing asked him, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d\u201cTry it yourself!\u201d Jiang Xu said. He wouldn\u2019t have shouted if it didn\u2019t hurt.Gu Qing glared at Jiang Xu. She absolutely wouldn\u2019t do that to herself.\u201cHa-ha, ha-ha.\u201d Both Gu Ning and Gu Man couldn\u2019t help laughing out loud.\u201cIt\u2019s real! Ningning said that she wanted to wait to tell you till she bought the house. So we all kept it a secret,\u201d Gu Man explained.\u201cBut, the houses here aren\u2019t cheap at all! It must cost a lot to buy one here!\u201d Gu Qing said confused.They were poor and hadn\u2019t finished their education, but it didn\u2019t mean they knew nothing.Actually, Gu Man was also confused about that.Gu Ning hurriedly explained, \u201d Well. I\u2019m going to open a jewelry business, so I went to City G this weekend to buy raw jade materials. However, the raw materials are all covered with stone layers. There are piles and piles of them. No one knows which one actually has jade inside. Thus it\u2019s generally a gamble. Whoever cuts jade out from the raw materials can sell it on site. It\u2019s super hard to get an emerald though. I don\u2019t know whether I was lucky or something. I bought five raw materials, and fortunately there were three high-level emeralds in them. I sold one which in the size of an apple, and earned more than twenty million yuan! I used that money to buy the houses. Besides, as for the other two emeralds, I\u2019ll leave one for Mu Ke\u2019s company, while the other one will be used to make jewelry for all of you.\u201dBefore they could recover from the last shock, they all were shocked once more by Gu Ning\u2019s words.What? More than twenty million yuan?This was the first time they had ever known it could be so easy to make money!After a long time, they finally recovered.\u201cNingning, you\u2019re so bold to play stone gambling!\u201d Gu Man criticized Gu Ning gently. She was more worried about her daughter.She had heard of stone gambling. It was a highly risky business.One could either become super rich or poor overnight. It was too dangerous.\u201cMom, don\u2019t worry. I know how to handle it.\u201d Gu Ning immediately comforted her mother.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Gu Man didn\u2019t know what to say. She still chose to believe in her daughter.Gu Ning had made a lot of money. The family of Gu Qing also felt happy for her, but she gave them such an expensive house, so they all felt a little awkward.\u201cNingning, I know you\u2019re being kind, but the house is too expensive. We\u2026\u201d Gu Qing opened her mouth. She wanted to reject it.\u201cAunt, I know clearly how much you\u2019ve helped me and my mother ever since I was a little girl. Please accept it. We\u2019re a family after all. I can\u2019t see you all live a poor life any longer,\u201d Gu Ning interrupted Gu Qing.\u201cIndeed! Please accept it. We only have each other now. We\u2019re family,\u201d Gu Man added.Everyone was upset suddenly.True! They only had each other now.The rest of the Gu Family disliked them and kept a distance away from them.\u201cGreat, great,\u201d Gu Qing answered at the end. She burst into tear with happiness.\u201cMom, can we live in such a nice house from now on?\u201d Jiang Xinyue asked with anticipation in her eyes.It was understandable that everyone wanted a better life.Gu Qing and her husband felt a little guilty that they weren\u2019t able to provide a good life for their daughter.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Translator: Henyee Translations Editor: Henyee Translations\u201cYes. We\u2019ll live in such a nice house after tomorrow,\u201d Gu Qing answered with love in her eyes.Having the affirmative answer, Jiang Xinyue was so excited that she almost jumped up. \u201cWow! It\u2019s so great!\u201dSeeing Jiang Xinyue being happy, Jiang Xu and Gu Qing as her parents were also happy.\u201cAlright, it\u2019s almost eight pm. I\u2019m starving. Mom, aunt, please cook dinner for us,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cOh, it\u2019s almost eight. We need to cook now!\u201d Gu Qing immediately left the sofa and pulled Gu Man, running to the kitchen.Gu Ning wanted to discuss something with Jiang Xu, so she didn\u2019t go to help. She also stopped Jiang Xu who wanted to help.\u201cUncle, can we have a talk?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cSure,\u201d Jiang Xu answered, but he asked Jiang Xinyue to go help.\u201cUncle, since we\u2019re not poor any longer, I naturally don\u2019t want you to continue doing labor work for so little money. Of course, I know you can\u2019t stay unemployed. I also don\u2019t want to see that. In the past, we could only live a hard life, but now, we can live a better and better life. So, I want to ask you. Do you want to start a thriving business and improve our lives in the future? Or you simply want to run a small business? As long as you don\u2019t have to be hungry or cold, no matter what you want, I can fully support you financially,\u201d Gu Ning said.Jiang Xu wasn\u2019t clever, or cunning enough. He probably wasn\u2019t capable of running a business.However, he worked hard and was diligent. He also liked learning. As long as he was determined, Gu Ning trusted that he could truly make something.Jiang Xu was delighted to start a company, but he felt awkward about the money.Gu Ning had already given them a house. He felt utterly embarrassed if he asked Gu Ning for money as well.Gu Ning also knew what was on Jiang Xu\u2019s mind. She encouraged him, \u201cUncle, no one respects us, only because we\u2019re poor. You\u2019re the only man in our family. You must be strong and powerful to protect us!\u201dGu Ning only said that to comfort Jiang Xu. She had no intention to reveal her other properties before she could do better than the Tang Family.It needed more than money to surpass the Tang Family. Money didn\u2019t mean everything.She also needed power and support from the authorities.It was hard to force an official to leave his position with money, but it was much easier to ruin someone\u2019s company with power.Therefore, a good network was very significant.Thus Gu Ning planned to network actively in the future.Jiang Xu was touched. What Gu Ning had said affected him a lot.Exactly! Only because they were poor, no one respected them.Especially Gu Man and Gu Qing, they had been despised and discriminated against by the rest of the Gu Family for a long time.As long as Gu Man, Gu Qing or Jiang Xu himself were powerful, the Gu Family wouldn\u2019t dare to do that.Jiang Xu was immediately full of passion, but he was still embarrassed about the money.\u201cUncle, I know that you are worried about the money. If that\u2019s the case, I can help you with money and you can give my mother a 20% share of your company. My mother of course won\u2019t work in your company, or interfere in your business. You need to work hard yourself. Please don\u2019t underestimate the 20% shares either. If your business grows bigger, 20% shares will soon be equal to the money I give you. So just take it as I lend you the money, and do not feel any pressure,\u201d Gu Ning said.Although Jiang Xu was almost convinced by Gu Ning, he was still a little worried. \u201cWhat if the company isn\u2019t profitable?\u201d\u201cIt happens in business. Nothing good comes without risk! You don\u2019t need to worry about the money at all. I can totally afford it!\u201d Gu Ning said sincerely. She was unbelievably confident.Yes, she could afford it.She didn\u2019t want Jiang Xu to do the same thing as her. Her goal was to build a business empire with billions or hundreds of billions in assets. As long as Jiang Xu could be successful in City F, several hundred million yuan would be enough.Thus, Gu Ning planned to invest ten million yuan into Jiang Xu\u2019s business. She had several hundred million yuan in wealth. She could completely afford it.Although Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t interfere in Jiang Xu\u2019s business, if he had any trouble, she would never step aside.Gu Man and Gu Qing heard the talk between Gu Ning and Jiang Xu in the kitchen.Gu Qing was already crying in happiness. \u201cNingning, she\u2019s such a great kid!\u201d\u201cYes, Ningning is doing this for our good. We can\u2019t disappoint her, right?\u201d Gu Man said on purpose.Gu Qing immediately understood what Gu Man\u2019s purpose was. She walked out, talking to Jiang Xu. \u201cXu, please accept it. We must be strong and powerful. No one is going to take advantage of us anymore!\u201dWith Gu Qing\u2019s support, Jiang Xu was now fully convinced. He answered at once, \u201cGreat, I\u2019ll do it!\u201dActually, he had always had the idea to run his own business, but lacked the money.\u201cActually, I have a friend who invited me to do the business of construction materials together. I really wanted to join him at that time. However, because I didn\u2019t have the money, I gave up at the end. In three years, he already has millions of yuan in wealth. His wife and children all live a good life. Honestly, I\u2019m very jealous of him,\u201d Jiang Xuman said with embarrassment.Construction materials?Hearing that, Gu Ning\u2019s eyes lit up. It was a good idea.Gu Ning planned to be involved in real estate industry, and construction materials would be highly important to her business. It would be better if her uncle could help.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good idea. Uncle, I agree with you to do the business of construction materials. I\u2019ll invest ten million yuan,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cWhat? Ten million yuan?\u201d Hearing that, Jiang Xu was astonished. He thought a million yuan would be enough. He didn\u2019t expect it would cost ten million yuan.\u201cUncle, since we\u2019re getting involved. Why not start a bigger business? Don\u2019t be a chicken!\u201d Gu Ning encouraged him.\u201cGreat, Ningning, I won\u2019t let you all down!\u201d Since Jiang Xu had made up his mind, he decided to do his best.\u201cAunt, you can quit your job too. Whether you want to help uncle, or be a housewife, or open a small shop, you can choose. Besides, women need to take good care of themselves. We were poor before, but now we don\u2019t need to worry about money at all! I won\u2019t go to school tomorrow. After we finish the legal procedure of buying a house, we can go buy skincare products, clothes and jewelry, and then get our hair done,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83In case Gu Qing would refuse, Gu Ning immediately added, \u201cAunt, you can\u2019t reject that. We\u2019re family. We need to support each other.\u201dSince they were family, Gu Qing couldn\u2019t reject. She said, \u201cFine, I\u2019ll listen to you, but isn\u2019t it inappropriate that you don\u2019t go to school tomorrow?\u201dGu Ning was already not good at studying. Gu Qing was afraid it would affect her studies if she asked for leave.\u201cIt\u2019s just one day off, it\u2019ll be fine. Besides, we can only finish the procedure on a weekday,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cFine,\u201d Gu Qing compromised.As for Gu Man, she now believed that her Gu Ning was able to handle her life and studies.\u201cOh, I also bought clothes in City G for you. Let me bring them out for you now.\u201d saying that, Gu Ning walked to the second room. She needed to take those gifts out of the telepathic eye space.\u201cReally?\u201dGu Qing didn\u2019t know what to say. They were all moved by Gu Ning\u2019s kindness.Gu Ning brought many bags from the room, placing them all on the sofa. Gu Qing immediately pulled Gu Man to go have a look.\u201cI bought a gift for everyone! This is for uncle.\u201d Gu Ning put a bag before Jiang Xu. Then she gave Gu Man and Gu Qing a bag separately. \u201cThese two are for both of you.\u201dGu Man and Gu Qing immediately took the bags.\u201cXinyue, this is yours.\u201d Gu Ning gave the last bag to Jiang Xinyue. Jiang Xinyue took it, and thanked her, \u201cThank you, sister.\u201dGu Ning didn\u2019t take hers out.\u201cWow, this is Lanc\u00f4me! It must be expensive!\u201d Gu Qing couldn\u2019t help but raise her voice in surprise.She obviously knew Lanc\u00f4me was a famous and expensive international brand.\u201cThis-this is Armani!\u201d Jiang Xu was also amazed. He always dreamed of having a good suit, but he didn\u2019t have enough money to buy one.Now Gu Ning sent him a much more expensive suit.\u201cIt\u2019s Gucci! It\u2019s so beautiful!\u201d Gu Qing was surprised and excited. She kept holding it against her body and asked Gu Man, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Gu Man smiled. She looked at the clothing in her hands. She also loved them.Although they had none of the vanity, as women they also loved beautiful clothes.\u201cThe dress is so pretty!\u201d Jiang Xinyue raised her voice with excitement.\u201cThere are phones!\u201dFinally, everyone discovered the phones at the bottom. They got excited once more.\u201cI have a new phone!\u201d Jiang Xinyue almost screamed.The rest all pulled out a new phone from the bottom of their bags, and unwrapped it.\u201cIt\u2019s so lovely!\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201dEveryone held their new clothes and new phones in their hands. They could barely put them down.\u201cWhat\u2019s that smell?\u201d Gu Ning smelt something then immediately ran to kitchen.Gu Man and Gu Qing immediately followed her. They forgot to turn off the fire.Luckily, it wasn\u2019t too late.Gu Ning had an acute sense of smell, so she discovered it early.When Gu Ning was finally free, she checked their \u201cFamily of Fighters\u201d WeChat group. Everyone mentioned her in the chatting history. They all cared whether she was back or not, with their gifts of course.Gu Ning shook her head lightly. She typed and sent:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m back at home, but I won\u2019t be at school tomorrow. I\u2019ll give the gifts to you all the day after tomorrow.\u201dHao Ran: \u201cBoss, what happened? May I help?\u201dMu Ke: \u201cYeah, what happened?\u201dGu Ning: \u201cNothing, I need to deal with something with my mother and my aunt. Please keep it between us, and don\u2019t let the teacher know!\u201dHao Ran: \u201cYou mother left the hospital? Why didn\u2019t you tell us earlier? We could have gone to pick you up and celebrate!\u201dZhang Tianping: \u201cExactly!\u201dGu Ning: \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201dChu Peihan: \u201cHow about our gifts?\u201dEveryone: \u201cYes! What did you buy for us?\u201dGu Ning: \u201cYou\u2019ll know the day after tomorrow. Alright, I need to have my dinner now. Bye-bye.\u201dThen, Gu Ning ignored them. It was the time for dinner.Actually it was 9 pm already so they were having night snacks, but everyone enjoyed it so much.After the dinner, it was almost 10 pm. Gu Qing\u2019s family soon left.They had a lot to do, so Gu Man didn\u2019t ask them to stay tonight.They left their clothes here though, since they would be moving in tomorrow.While they were leaving, Gu Ning reminded them just to bring everything important with them tomorrow, and to leave the other stuff in the old house.They could sell the furniture later.Moreover, Gu Ning also told them not to tell the rest in the Gu Family. They wanted to live their own lives.After Gu Qing\u2019s family was gone, Gu Ning and Gu Man went back to their own rooms.Gu Man intended to let Gu Ning use the master room, but Gu Ning refused to do so.Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t be staying here for too long. After half a year, she would be going to the capital city. By then, she would buy a new house under her name.Gu Ning also had no intention to let Gu Man move in with her in the future. Her mother could come and visit her if her mother wanted to.Once she was in the capital city, the situation would be complicated, so Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to involve Gu Man.Gu Ning hadn\u2019t brought too much stuff from the old house the other day. They didn\u2019t have many valuable objects either, so she had dumped all the old broken stuff.Gu Ning planned to live a brand new life.Gu Man and Gu Ning talked for a long while before they went to bed.It was almost 12 pm, Gu Ning checked the Wechat group again before she went asleep. Her friends were still talking, but she stayed quiet.Both Gu Man and Gu Ning had a great night. Gu Qing and Jiang Xu however didn\u2019t sleep at all. They were too busy thinking about what had happened today.\u201cXu, do you feel unbelieving about what happened tonight?\u201d Gu Qing asked. She hadn\u2019t fully recovered from the shock.It felt like they had been on a rocket, and had gone up high into the sky directly from the ground.\u201cI do, but it is real,\u201d Jiang Xu answered.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84\u201cNingning is totally different now. She just said that she would let us live a good life last week. And she fulfilled her promise this week! It\u2019s so surprising!\u201d Gu Qing said.\u201cExactly, Ningning has been being a completely different girl ever since she had the car accident. She has suddenly become mature, independent, outgoing and confident. She behaves nothing like an 18-year-old girl,\u201d Jiang Xu said. He was even was a little ashamed that he didn\u2019t have power like Gu Ning.After a while, he added, \u201cNo matter what, it\u2019s a good thing that Ningning changed. She now knows how to fight back. The Gu Family has broken Ningning and her mother\u2019s heart. They have even kicked them out of the old house. Luckily, Ningning is powerful now, or they would live a harder life.\u201d\u201cIndeed! If they knew Ningning is rich now, they would be envious! They would probably try to have a good relationship with a rich Ningning. Those people are sick!\u201d Gu Qing had seen through the rest of the people in the Gu Family.\u201cWe must be low-key in front of them. Don\u2019t cause any trouble,\u201d Jiang Xu said.They didn\u2019t fall asleep until three o\u2019clock in the morning.The next day, Jiang Xinyue got up to go to school. Gu Qing and Jiang Xu were awake too. It was still early, but they couldn\u2019t sleep any more.They were so thrilled to move into a new house.Gu Qing told Jiang Xinyue to go straight to Fenghua Luxury Mansion when she left her school today.Jiang Xinyue was also excited to move into the new house today.Although they were going to move out today, they weren\u2019t in a hurry to get their deposit back, because the lease of their old house wouldn\u2019t be ending until the end of the month.Gu Qing went to work as usual. She had already written her resignation letter last night. She planned to ask to resign when she got to work.Gu Qing was just an ordinary worker, so it wouldn\u2019t make any difference if she resigned. Thus it was very easy for her to resign.After her resignation, Gu Qing called Jiang Xu. They went to Fenghua Luxury Mansion separately.They did not live far away from Fenghua Luxury Mansion. It only took more than half an hour to get there by bus, but if it was rush hour, it took around an hour even by car.There wasn\u2019t a direct bus there and Jiang Xu was also pulling two big suitcases, so it wasn\u2019t convenient for them to take a bus. They ended up taking a taxi.Gu Ning made it a daily routine to get up early. She got up around six o\u2019clock this morning, and went to have run downstairs.She had run for an hour with three breaks.After she caught her breath, she called her head teacher to ask for a leave.It was not easy to ask for a leave as a senior in a high school, except if it was a special situation.Gu Ning then lied to her teacher, she said that she was on her period, and it hurt so much that she couldn\u2019t get up.Her head teacher was a woman too and she understood how painful it could be. Thus she agreed.Gu Ning felt a little guilty. But she had to ask for a leave today.Gu Ning finished her run before she went back home to take a shower.At that time, Gu Man woke up. She was still a little confused when she found herself in the brand new house.Gu Man got up to prepare breakfast.When it was almost 10 o\u2019clock, Gu Man received a call from Gu Qing saying that they had arrived.Gu Ning let her mother tell them to wait at the sale department. They would be right downstairs.Ten minutes later, both Gu Ning and Gu Man went downstairs.Gu Ning had called Wei Zhirui before, so he was already waiting at the sales hall.The minute Gu Ning and her family walked in, Wei Zhirui welcomed them with great passion.Gu Qing had already made her choice of the house, so she directly told Gu Qing and Jiang Xu to take out their documents so that they could finish the legal procedure.After that, Gu Ning paid the money before they got the key.Wei Zhirui also gave Gu Ning\u2019s key back to her. Gu Ning had given the key to him because she had asked him to get an hourly cleaner to clean her new house.When Gu Qing and Jiang Xu received the keys and the property ownership certificate, their hands were trembling.They had never believed that they would own a house one day, even though the house was a gift from Gu Ning.They all went back home with the suitcases afterwards.Wei Zhirui felt touched while he walked Gu Ning and her family out. She was such a great kid. She not only bought a house for herself, but she also bought a house for the family of her aunt. They must be very close!They went back to the ninth floor, building No. 2, zone G, and stopped at No. 906, which was Gu Qing\u2019s family\u2019s new house.They opened the door and walked inside.Although they already knew what it was like inside, they were still amazed by what they saw before their own eyes.Gu Qing\u2019s family walked all around with excitement, like children at Halloween.\u201cLet\u2019s have a meal here first before we go out!\u201d Gu Ning said.Then, they walked out of No. 906, and stepped into No. 901.Gu Man and Gu Qing went to cook together, while Gu Ning and Jiang Xu were talking.\u201cUncle, do you have any difficulties in starting the business of construction materials?\u201d Gu Ning asked. She didn\u2019t want to interfere in Jiang Xu\u2019s business. She just cared about it.\u201cAs for the materials, I plan to go to the construction materials market today and have a look. As for the manufacturers, with a ten million yuan fund, we naturally will only use the best. I\u2019ll look up on the Internet first later before I contact the manufacturers,\u201d Jiang Xu said.\u201cVery well! I\u2019ll transfer one million yuan to you then. You can go buy a car. We don\u2019t need to be too high-profile at the beginning so five hundred thousand yuan would be enough. You can buy it directly in your name. Also buy a computer for yourself. The rest can be used as the deposit to find a store,\u201d Gu Ning said.After the meal, they went out.Gu Ning had intended to let Gu Man and Gu Qing put on their new clothes, but they refuse because they hadn\u2019t gotten used to it yet.Gu Ning didn\u2019t force them to. It took time, and she understood.There were many banks outside of Fenghua Luxury Mansion, so Gu Ning transferred a million yuan into Jiang Xu\u2019s account. She then also transferred one million yuan into Gu Man\u2019s and Gu Qing\u2019s card separately.Gu Qing tried to reject. She thought she had received too many things from Gu Ning.It was a million yuan after all, which was too much in Gu Qing\u2019s eyes.However, Gu Ning persuaded her to accept it. Gu Qing was now more than moved.Jiang Xu couldn\u2019t start his business in a short time. Besides, it took time to run it properly. They didn\u2019t go to work during that time, and were without other sources of income, so they could only rely on their savings.Both Gu Man and Gu Qing had never had such a huge amount of money in their accounts. They seized their cards in hands tightly, in case it would be lost.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85: 85Jiang Xu went to deal with his business, while Gu Ning along with Gu Man and Gu Qing took a taxi heading to the Commercial Building in downtown.Gu Ning proposed to buy clothes first, but was stopped by Gu Qing. \u201cNingning, you already bought us clothes yesterday. We don\u2019t need to waste more money on clothing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not enough! My mom and I have dumped all of our old clothes. We also need to buy new clothing. Relax, we\u2019re not going to buy the designer brands, but some common brands,\u201d Gu Ning comforted.They didn\u2019t need too many luxurious clothes. Luxurious clothing was only for important or special occasions.In daily life, they could wear ordinary clothes.People wore designer brand just to show off. Many medium-level brands were also of great quality.Gu Qing listened to Gu Ning at the end.They went to a medium-level brand of clothes to shop for Gu Man and Gu Qing.Even though the brand was just medium-level, it was still a luxury for Gu Man and Gu Qing because they had never been to places like that.Therefore, they were intimidated when they stepped in.Gu Man and Gu Qing weren\u2019t wearing good clothes, and seemed poor, plus both of them behaved in an unconfident way, so the saleswoman assumed that they couldn\u2019t afford anything. Thus she didn\u2019t even bother to greet them.Gu Ning ignored the saleswoman. She guided Gu Qing and Gu Man, walking around casually. If they liked it, they could buy something. If they didn\u2019t like it, they would leave.Gu Qing chose a piece of clothing. She turned the price tag, and was shocked. \u201cGee! It costs 1,800 yuan!\u201d 1,800 yuan was her salary for half a month!Although she knew the clothes Gu Ning had bought for them cost much more than that, she still though the price was too high when she saw it with her own eyes.Meanwhile, a sarcastic female voice sounded, \u201cIf you can\u2019t afford a 1,800 yuan piece of clothing, then don\u2019t ever step in here. Look at what you\u2019re wearing. You only deserve cheap stuff.\u201dGu Qing felt utterly embarrassed. She lowered her head in shame.Gu Ning was upset. She looked to the woman, which was surprisingly familiar. Gu Ning lifted the corner of her lips. She looked evil, and called, \u201cOh, isn\u2019t this Ms Jin?\u201dThe woman heard Gu Ning\u2019s voice. Her face changed immediately. \u201cWho are you? I-I don\u2019t know you!\u201dGu Ning was now sure that the woman must have gone to get her jewelry identified, given that she was being so diffident. If her jewelry had been real, she would have been mad to see Gu Ning again.\u201cDon\u2019t you remember? It was last Sunday, in the jewelry store\u2026\u201d Gu Ning reminded her on purpose.\u201cShut your mouth!\u201d The woman panicked and interrupt Gu Ning.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d At that time, a woman in her early forties dressed in an extravagant way walked over from the other side. Her eyes rounded when she saw Gu Ning and her family.Both Gu Qing and Gu Man were surprised and felt uneasy to meet the woman.Gu Ning squinted her eyes with coldness.The woman was Lin Lijuan, Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s mother.\u201cGu Qing, Gu Man, what are you doing here?\u201d Lin Lijuan asked in surprised.It was beyond her imagination that Gu Qing and Gu Man would show up here. In her eyes, they always wore cheap stuff from the street stalls.Gu Qing and Gu Man didn\u2019t want to talk to Lin Lijuan at first, but they were relatives after all. It wasn\u2019t appropriate if they ignored her question in the public.Accordingly, Gu Qing said airily, \u201cWe\u2019re just here to have a look.\u201dGu Qing didn\u2019t want her to know that they were here to shop.In front of Lin Lijuan, they preferred to pretend to be poor forever.\u201cOh, I thought you picked up money on the roads, and you dare to walk in a place like that!\u201d Hearing that, Lin Lijuan suddenly changed her tone. She didn\u2019t bother to hide her complete disdain.\u201cLin, do you know them?\u201d the woman asked.\u201cYeah, yeah. I\u2019ve told you about them before. They\u2019re my sisters-in-law.\u201d Lin Lijuan sneered.It seemed Lin Lijuan had badmouthed Gu Qing and Gu Man often behind their backs.The woman immediately looked at Gu Man and Gu Qing with intense dislike. But since Gu Ning was here too, she didn\u2019t dare to laugh at them.\u201cGu Man, you were brave to move out from the old house, rather than apologize to us.\u201d Although Lin Lijuan was still mad at Gu Ning. Gu Man and Gu Ning had paid for their behavior. Thus she wasn\u2019t as annoyed as before, but now, seeing that Gu Qing was with Gu Man, Lin Lijuan believed that Gu Qing must have let Gu Man stay with her. She was immediately irritated. \u201cGu Qing, did you let Gu Man stay with you? Our mother has made it clear. If you dare to let Gu Man stay with you, we won\u2019t help you anymore.\u201dIt sounded like they had helped Gu Qing.Gu Ning, who had been ignored, couldn\u2019t help laughing in an ironic way.Lin Lijuan didn\u2019t notice Gu Ning until now, but when she looked to Gu Ning, she was amazed at her first glance.Yes, she was amazed, because Gu Ning was totally different now.Gu Ning was more beautiful than before, and she didn\u2019t abase herself before anyone any longer. She looked elegant to some extent.\u201cThat makes it sound like the Gu Family has ever helped my aunt. As far as I know, my aunt had relied on herself ever since she got married.\u201d Gu Ning stared at Lin Lijuan. She didn\u2019t bother to hide her complete dislike either.Lin Lijuan immediately wore an unpleasant face.She was embarrassed by Gu Ning\u2019s words in public.Then, Gu Qing followed up. \u201cLin Lijuan, let\u2019s be clear. We have never ever received your help! Besides, Gu Man doesn\u2019t stay with me now.\u201dShe had indeed never received help from Gu Qinxiang. She wouldn\u2019t let Lin Lijuan take advantage of her.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Lijuan\u2019s face seemed more unpleasant. But she couldn\u2019t deny the truth.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86After a long breath in, Lin Lijuan lied without hesitation, \u201cGu Qing, we\u2019re relatives. How could I step aside when you need help? The point is that you never talk to us about your troubles! And Gu Man, the old house belongs to the sons of our mother, but we\u2019ve allowed you to live in there for so many years. We\u2019ve done a lot for you both!\u201d\u201cThey paid you rent! Besides, it was you who kicked them out when they were in trouble!\u201d Gu Qing retorted.Lin Lijuan was immediately mad. \u201cThat was because Gu Ning hit my daughter and even refused to apologize! They deserved it!\u201d\u201cShe deserved it.\u201d Gu Ning met Lin Lijuan\u2019s glare without cowardice.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Lin Lijuan was annoyed as well as surprised that Gu Ning dared to talk to her in that way.The people in the Gu Family, especially the younger generation all respected her the most, but Gu Ning was different. She even humiliated Gu Xiaoxiao in front of Lin Lijuan\u2019s face. \u201cWhat do you think you are to hit my daughter?\u201d Lin Lijuan said.\u201cWhat does she think she is to insult me?\u201d Gu Ning asked back.\u201cSo what? What do you think you are? You bastard!\u201d Lin Lijuan swore at Gu Ning in public. She behaved like a crazy woman.\u201cShut up!\u201d Both Gu Qing and Gu Man snapped. They were totally aggravated.\u201cLin Lijuan, Ningning is my daughter. I won\u2019t allow you to humiliate her!\u201d Gu Man slammed.Gu Man was gentle, or weak to some extent in her daily life, but once Gu Ning was involved, she would become a hedgehog and attack the enemy at once.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have a father. She is a bastard!\u201d Lin Lijuan instead didn\u2019t feel guilty at all.At that time, Lin Lijuan only felt that it suddenly went black. When she got her mind back, Gu Ning\u2019s face was already magnified in front of her eyes.There was pure coldness in Gu Ning\u2019s eyes. Lin Lijuan immediately felt great pressure. She couldn\u2019t breathe or move at all.Then, Gu Ning said coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t think that just because you\u2019re older than me, I wouldn\u2019t dare to hit you. If I even hear the word bastard from your mouth once more, you\u2019ll pay for it.\u201dGu Ning\u2019s words were like magic sounds, which sank deeply into Lin Lijuan\u2019s mind. She didn\u2019t question her words at all, but felt very frightened.\u201cMom, aunt, let\u2019s go.\u201d Gu Ning ignored Lin Lijuan. She left with Gu Man and Gu Qing.She didn\u2019t want to argue with Lin Lijuan in public, especially when Gu Man and Gu Qing were here too.Lin Lijuan might not want to maintain her dignity, but Gu Man and Gu Qing cherished theirs.When Gu Ning and her families were gone, Lin Lijuan finally got her mind back because of a sound from the woman next to her. Although Lin Lijuan still felt afraid of Gu Ning, she was more mad at Gu Ning who had treated her in that way.Why? How could Gu Ning do that?Lin Lijuan then realized that everyone around gave her a strange glance because she had behaved like a crazy woman. She regretted it immediately and then rushed out.Although Lin Lijuan was always pushy and mean to her family, she valued her appearance in others\u2019 eyes very much. However, today she hadn\u2019t restrained herself.Gu Qing and Gu Man were both annoyed, but they already knew what kind of person Lin Lijuan was, so they kind of got used to it.\u201cAlright, don\u2019t be mad at someone who isn\u2019t important at all. Let\u2019s keep on shopping,\u201d Gu Ning comforted.Gu Qing and Gu Man sighed heavily. Actually, they had worried most that Gu Ning would be hurt. However, because Gu Ning remained calm, and they also relaxed a little.After a while, they all cheered up. Each one of them had many bags in hand.They bought a lot, not only for themselves, but also for Jiang Xu and Jiang Xinyue. The price ranged from hundreds to thousands of yuan.Each had bought four to five suits of clothes.Women loved shopping. Although Gu Man and Gu Qing were not willing to spend a lot of money at first, they soon forgot about it while shopping in the mall.After that, they went to buy sheet sets.Gu Ning and her mother bought four sets. Each room needed three sets for replacement. There were three bedrooms in their new house. They naturally needed nine sets in all. However, there were already three sheet sets on the beds in their new house. They were all new too and only needed to be washed.They had also bought two sheet sets yesterday, and only needed to buy another four sheet sets.Even though the guest room was empty almost all the time, they wanted to make it look cosy as well.Gu Qing\u2019s family bought six sheet sets for their three rooms as well.Those sheet sets were too heavy to carry. Gu Ning also couldn\u2019t put them into the telepathic eye space, because it would expose herself.Therefore, they could only get the shop owner to help them with delivery. Not now, but when they were about to leave.There were all kinds of food on the underground floor of the Commercial Building. Cosmetics were on the first floor, and jewelry on the second floor, women\u2019s clothing was on the third floor, men\u2019s clothing on the fourth floor, furniture and domestic appliances on the fifth floor and children\u2019s clothes and stationery on were the sixth floor, while musical instruments and sports equipment were on the seventh floor.Gu Ning went down to the second floor to buy jewelry for Gu Man and Gu Qing.Although gold was a little boring, it was suitable for women at Gu Man and Gu Qing\u2019s age.Jade would be more suitable of course, but their jade hadn\u2019t been done yet. Gu Ning had to wait for Qin Yifan to come back and take the jade to make jewelry. Thus she decided to buy gold for now.They bought one set each.A necklace, a pair of earrings, a bracelet and a ring.Gold wasn\u2019t expensive. One set just cost around forty to fifty thousand yuan.They then went to get a VIP card in a high-end beauty salon near the Commercial Building. However, their time was limited today, so they didn\u2019t use it right away.After they got the card, it was almost 5 pm. They also needed to go back home, because Jiang Xinyue was about to leave her school to go home too.They directly took the delivery car with their sheet sets home.The delivery car stopped at the outside of G zone, so Gu Ning and her family had to carry all the stuff back by themselves.Luckily, Jiang Xinyue was back, and she could help.At the end, Jiang Xinyue carried two sheet sets, Gu Qing and Gu Man each carried four sheet sets, while Gu Ning carried the rest of the bags.When they were finally home, it was 6 pm already. It was time for their meal.Gu Qing called Jiang Xu to ask him when he would get back. Jiang Xu was already on his way home, so Gu Qing asked him to go buy some food ingredients on his way.Although it was a tiring day, they all had great fun.Jiang Xinyue jumped around with her new clothes in hand. She had never had so many beautiful clothes before!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87: 87Before Jiang Xu got home, everyone was resting.On the other side, Lin Lijuan had been aggravated by Gu Ning. She stopped shopping and went back home earlier.Once she got home, Lin Lijuan kept swearing at Gu Ning and her mother.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Her mother-in-law asked. Although she heard Lin Lijuan swearing at Gu Ning and her mother, she didn\u2019t know what had happened.Lin Lijuan then told the old lady everything.\u201cWhat? Gu Ning the bastard threatened you today? Isn\u2019t today Monday? Why wasn\u2019t she at school?\u201d The old lady was also surprised.Hearing that, Lin Lijuan finally realized today was Monday, but Gu Ning wasn\u2019t in her school. \u201cWho knows. She probably dropped out!\u201dSaying that, Lin Lijuan even believed it was true, and slightly felt happy.\u201cIf she really dropped out, she deserved it. She wouldn\u2019t apologize to Xiaoxiao, and even yelled at me.\u201d The old lady snorted with anger. She had no sympathy for her granddaughter at all.\u201cOh, did Gu Qing behave against my warning and let Gu Man and Gu Qing stay with her?\u201d the old lady asked.\u201cI don\u2019t know. She said no.\u201d Although Gu Qing had denied it, Lin Lijuan didn\u2019t believe her. The rent was so high outside. How could Gu Man and Gu Qing afford it?\u201cNo, I must give them a call.\u201d The old lady seemed like she enjoyed humiliating Gu Man and Gu Ning so much. She immediately took out her phone and called Gu Man.Unfortunately, no one answered.Gu Man did it on purpose of course.The old lady called her after they had had a fierce argument with Lin Lijuan. She must be calling to criticize them. Gu Man didn\u2019t want to answer the call at all.\u2026Jiang Xu had walked around in the construction materials market. There was a good location to open a shop, but it was too small.Jiang Xu did have a good choice, but the store was located outside of the construction materials market. It was noticeable and huge, around 300 square meters, and the annual rent was five hundred thousand yuan.If his business was profitable, he could get the utilities fee back within several months, but if his business wasn\u2019t profitable, it would hard to settle a deal within a year.After Gu Ning heard the news, she thought that they had to choose the huge store, and run a big business. Therefore, she supported Jiang Xu.Although Jiang Xu thought it was a little risky, he was happy.Gu Ning understood Jiang Xu was slightly worried. She comforted him to do his best, he didn\u2019t need to worry about the money.Before Gu Ning went to sleep, she talked with her friends in their \u201cFamily of Fighters\u201d WeChat group. She told them to keep training tomorrow.Anyone who didn\u2019t show up before 6:20 am wouldn\u2019t get his or her gift.Knowing that, each of them all promised they would show up on time tomorrow.Except for Yu Mixi, the rest all didn\u2019t lack money, or gifts. However, they lacked meaningful gifts. It had nothing to do with the price.As long as the gift was from Gu Ning, they would be happy even if it was only worth several yuan.The next morning, Gu Ning got up at 5:30 am and left her home at 5:35 am.Fenghua Luxury Mansion was seven to eight kilometers away from her school. It took her around 25 minutes to get there by running.When she arrived at her school, it was 6 am. She went to buy breakfast, and coincidentally met Yu Mixi on her way.That girl was pretty early today!\u201cNingning, you\u2019re finally back!\u201d Seeing Gu Ning, Yu Mixi was super excited. She ran to Gu Ning and held her arm tightly.They seemed very close, but it was quite normal between close friends.Although Gu Ning didn\u2019t like to have physical touch with others, she could accept it if the other person was her friend.\u201cWhat do you want for breakfast? It\u2019s on me!\u201d Yu Mixi asked.Yu Mixi was Gu Ning\u2019s close friend so she didn\u2019t reject her kindness. \u201cA steamed bun and soy milk please!\u201dThey didn\u2019t have much time left, so it was convenient to have a steamed bun and soy milk.Both Gu Ning and Yu Mixi bought a steamed bun and soy milk. They went into their school together.\u201cNingning, can you tell me what my gift is?\u201d Yu Mixi was curious.\u201cSorry, I can\u2019t. I\u2019ll show you all when everyone arrives,\u201d Gu Ning answered.\u201cFine.\u201d Yu Mixi was a little disappointed.There were a few students running in the morning.They met Mu Ke halfway.They were all in school uniforms. Thus Mu Ke actually didn\u2019t recognize them from their back at first, but he soon recognized their voices.\u201cHey boss, Mixi.\u201dHe ran to them immediately.\u201cBoss, where is my gift?\u201d Mu Ke asked for his gift at once too.\u201cNingning said she would only show us when everyone arrives,\u201d Yu Mixi said before Gu Ning could.Mu Ke then had the same feeling of disappointment as Yu Mixi.When they arrived at the football field, it was 6:10 am. Chu Peihan came minutes later. She asked for her gift too, but got the same answer as well.A few minutes later, Hao Ran and his friends arrived. They ran here, and were all out of breath.\u201cBoss, where is my gift?\u201d Hao Ran asked with excitement.\u201cRun 10 circles first. The last one, except for Mixi, will only get his or her gift after the morning class,\u201d Gu Ning said, then she started to run.Ten circles amounted to four thousand meters.No!Hearing that, the boys all shouted in sadness. It was such a torture to them! The last one could only get his or her gift after the morning class. No one wanted to be the last one.No one dared to argue with Gu Ning, unless they wanted to get punched, so they had to follow her at the end.It seemed impossible for Hao Ran and his bros to beat Chu Peihan and Mu Ke, so they decided to compete with each other.They now became competitors for Gu Ning\u2019s gifts.Indeed, from the beginning, Hao Ran, Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping were left behind.However, they just hadn\u2019t caught their breath yet, it didn\u2019t mean they were weak. They actually weren\u2019t far behind Gu Ning.Gu Ning ran three times longer than the others, but with her power, she was now much stronger than before.She felt a little tired, but not much.She had run seven to eight kilometers from Fenghua Luxury Mansion to her school, but she was simply slightly out of breath. She didn\u2019t feel utterly exhausted anymore.Other than Gu Ning, Chu Peihan was the strongest among them.Although Gu Ning didn\u2019t know Chu Peihan\u2019s background very well, she believed she must has received long-term professional training.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Chu Peihan was one minute later than Gu Ning after they both had finished 10 circles.It took an ordinary man three minutes and thirty seconds to four minutes to run a kilometer. The longer you ran, the more tired you would feel.Gu Ning spent 13 minutes on four kilometers, while Chu Peihan spent 14 minutes.After running, Chu Peihan was exhausted, but she could still balance her body.Mu Ke was also one minute later than Chu Peihan.He almost collapsed on the ground.Yu Mixi who had run five circles came after Mu Ke. She was worn-out too, but after several days of running as training, Yu Mixi was stronger now.The last group was Hao Ran, Qin Zixun, and then Zhang Tianping. It took him almost 20 minutes to finish the 10 circles.\u201cHA-ha, I\u2019m not the last one.\u201d Hao Ran laughed excitedly. As if, if he had been the last one he would have been killed.\u201cNo big deal. I just need to wait until the morning class is over,\u201d Zhang Tianping said airily.\u201cRelax, I won\u2019t do it. I merely wanted you all to be active,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cWhat? Boss, you\u2019re so devious!\u201d everyone said with one accord, but their voices sounded weak.Gu Ning didn\u2019t care. She sat down on the lawn with her backpack, while the others all surrounded her.\u201cHonestly, I didn\u2019t know what to buy. I basically chose them randomly. These are for you four boys.\u201dSaying that, Gu Ning took out four paper boxes throwing them directly at the boys.\u201cWow, Boss! It\u2019s an international brand!\u201d Hao Ran raised his voice when he saw the logo on the boxes.\u201cExactly, boss, have you picked up money on the road?\u201d Mu Ke asked.Both Qin Zixun and Zhang Tianping looking at Gu Ning with curiosity and amazement.They all knew well about Gu Ning\u2019s background now. It was barely affordable for her to buy a well-known domestic brand.But, she even bought them stuff from an international brand as gifts.\u201cWhat brand?\u201d Chu Peihan immediately grabbed the box from Mu Ke. She glanced at it, and was shocked, \u201cGee! It\u2019s Armani!\u201dShe also stared at Gu Ning with surprise.Gu Ning didn\u2019t answer their questions, but took out a bag, giving it to Chu Peihan.When everyone saw the logo on the bag, they all rounded their eyes once more. It was Lanc\u00f4me.Chu Peihan threw the paper box back to Mu Ke at once. She even lost her interest in seeing what was inside.\u201cBoss, did you really pick up money on the roads? How generous are you!\u201d Chu Peihan took her gift and asked in shock.Gu Ning still didn\u2019t answer her question, but took out Yu Mixi\u2019s gift and gave it to her.\u201cWow! It\u2019s a wallet.\u201dMeanwhile, Hao Ran had opened his box.\u201cGee! It\u2019s a perfume. Boss, I love you! How could you know I love perfume so much!\u201d Chu Peihan was thrilled. She immediately hugged Gu Ning tightly.Gu Ning actually didn\u2019t know how much Chu Peihan loved perfume. She could just smell the fragrance every time she met Chu Peihan.\u201cOh, my gift is a phone!\u201d Yu Mixi opened her package. She was excited and surprised to see a phone inside.Although she already had a phone, it was old and second-hand. She even felt embarrassed to pull it out.\u201cNingning, it must be very expensive.\u201d Yu Mixi liked it very much, but it was too expensive in her eyes.\u201cIndeed, boss. It may sound a little harsh, but we all know your background. How could you afford such expensive gifts?\u201d Chu Peihan asked directly. They couldn\u2019t ignore the fact.The rest all stared at Gu Ning. They didn\u2019t say another word, but their faces showed their puzzlement.Gu Ning felt warmth in her heart at being cared for by all of her friends. Although she couldn\u2019t tell them too much, she decided to tell them something.Therefore, Gu Ning told them she had saved a man\u2019s life, and she got a King\u2019s Green which was worth ten million yuan as a reward.However, she didn\u2019t tell them what she had done in City G.\u201cWhat? The King\u2019s Green? Ten million yuan?\u201dKnowing that, everyone was struck dumb. It was so amazingly unbelievable!Except for Mu Ke and Qin Zixun, no one else knew much about jade, but they had all heard of the King\u2019s Green, which was the top type and super expensive.That was why it was worth ten million yuan for a piece the size of a quail\u2019s egg.Yu Mixi excluded, most of them were from rich families, especially Zhang Tianping who had millions of yuan in assets on his own. However, none of them had ever had ten million yuan in hand.Even Mu Ke\u2019s jewelry store only had several million yuan in assets.Accordingly, ten million yuan was a huge amount of money in their eyes.Besides, the jewelry in Mu Ke\u2019s jewelry store was all made of low-level jade. One ring only cost hundreds of yuan.The King\u2019s Green was merely a legend to them.Qin Zixun\u2019s family had run a jewelry business many generations ago. He had seen many medium-level jade, but he had only heard of the King\u2019s Green from books and the Internet.After a long while, everyone finally got their minds back. It was so shocking.\u201cBoss, you\u2019re so awesome!\u201d Hao Ran complimented. He now admired Gu Ning completely.The rest all agreed.Yu Mixi was envious, but not jealous. She knew she couldn\u2019t do it.\u201cBut boss, why didn\u2019t you let us have a look before selling it?\u201d Mu Ke complained.\u201cExactly! It would be more exciting to see the King\u2019s Green than a super star!\u201d Qin Zixun said.\u201cNo, no. I still prefer to see a super star, especially my idol, Xu Zhefan.\u201d Chu Peihan immediately became shy and was full of love. Everyone immediately got goosebumps.\u201cAlright, I don\u2019t want anyone else to know about it, or I might get robbed someday,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cSure, boss. We definitely won\u2019t tell others.\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89\u201cWe\u2019ll never tell others.\u201d Everyone promised.\u201cGreat! We need to go back to our classrooms now.\u201d Gu Ning stood up.The group then went back to the teaching building.Gu Xiaoxiao had heard about what had happened at the shopping mall yesterday from her mother. She didn\u2019t believe that Gu Ning had dropped out of the school, but she wanted to check for herself. Therefore, Gu Xiaoxiao kept looking at the stairs from the passage the minute she got to her school. She wanted to see whether Gu Ning would show up.\u201cGu Ning is increasingly arrogant now! Not only has she hit you, she has also argued with your grandmother! Now she has even threatened you mother! I think she is going to despise your whole family!\u201d Chen Ziyao said. She mainly wanted to add fuel to the flames.Chen Ziyao was way smarter than Gu Xiaoxiao. Ever since Hao Ran and his bros regarded Gu Ning as their boss, she had been afraid of Gu Ning, but she hated Gu Ning as always.Chen Ziyao had never been slapped by anyone, her parents included. She couldn\u2019t accept the fact that Gu Ning had hit her, but out of fright, Chen Ziyao didn\u2019t dare to annoy Gu Ning herself. Therefore, she tried to use Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s hands to deal with Gu Ning.If Gu Xiaoxiao had known about Chen Ziyao\u2019s scheme, she would have immediately broken off her relations with Chen Ziyao.Unfortunately, she didn\u2019t know. Instead, she was immediately irritated and retorted, \u201cImpossible! She is a poor bastard. What does she think she is to despise us!\u201dAlthough saying that, Gu Xiaoxiao did feel threatened by Gu Ning. Gu Ning had changed a lot these days. She suddenly became so excellent at fighting, and even made good friends with those rich kids.Thinking of that, Gu Xiaoxiao felt more annoyed and upset. A vicious look appeared on her face. \u201cI will ruin her!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao said.Chen Ziyao of course was happy to hear that. That was exactly what she wanted.Even though she doubted whether Gu Xiaoxiao could succeed or not, it had nothing to do with her after all.\u201cLook, Gu Ning is coming.\u201d At the same time, Chen Ziyao saw that Gu Ning and others were downstairs.Gu Xiaoxiao looked over. There were many people around Gu Ning, which made her even more jealous. \u201cIt\u2019s so disappointing.\u201dShe was now eager to ruin Gu Ning.When Gu Ning walked into her classroom, she almost knocked into Shao Feifei.In the past, Shao Feifei would have sworn at her already, but now, she just glared at Gu Ning without saying a word.Shao Feifei had the same feelings as Chen Ziyao. She hated Gu Ning as usual, but didn\u2019t dare to do anything.They all schemed to do something to get revenge on Gu Ning.The head teacher came to the classroom during the morning class. She informed the students there would be a monthly test this Friday.When the morning class was almost over, Gu Ning received a message from Qin Yifan. He was at the airport now, and would arrive at City F after two hours. He told her to come to Yicui Jade-store with her jade if she was free this afternoon.Qin Yifan couldn\u2019t wait to see the jade. He knew the jade had to be special, but Qin Yifan would never have expected that it was a top-level jade, even as rare as the King\u2019s Green.Gu Ning also wanted to make the jewelry as soon as possible, so she agreed to go see Qin Yifan this afternoon.The break was long, and Chu Peihan ran to the fourth classroom to play with Gu Ning and Yu Mixi.Once Chu Peihan appeared, everyone in the classroom felt frightened. They were all scared to be beaten by Chu Peihan.Mu Ke, Hao Ran and his bros all wanted to go to Gu Ning as well, but since they were boys, they were afraid it might cause unnecessary gossip for Gu Ning. Therefore they gave up at the end.Gu Ning immediately left her school when the morning classes were over.There was a black Hummer stopped by the road outside their school. It attracted lots of attention.The car was so cool. It was a Hummer. It must be super expensive.It cost at least several million yuan.Gu Ning was also attracted by that cool Hummer, but she just gave it two glances, then immediately left in a taxi.Gu Ning didn\u2019t see the person in the Hummer, but he saw her.Leng Shaoting was in the driver seat.Leng Shaoting showed up for a reason. He just flew here from City G. He wasn\u2019t sure Gu Ning would come out this afternoon, but he still came to her school. Coincidentally, he met her.Seeing Gu Ning head off in a taxi, Leng Shaoting drove his car and immediately followed her.Gu Ning didn\u2019t notice someone was following her. She got out at the Commercial Building, then directly went into the supermarket. She walked towards Yicui Jade-store afterwards.In Yicui Jade-store, Qin Yifan had been waited for a long time. The minute he had landed at 10 am, he came to his shop.Although he knew Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t show up until 12:30 pm, he couldn\u2019t wait to get here.Normally, Qin Yifan wouldn\u2019t stay in the store for longer than an hour for inspections, but this time, he had been here for over two hours. All the staff felt nervous and confused.When it was almost 12:20 pm, he kept looking at the entrance of the store.Therefore, once Gu Ning appeared in his sight, he immediately ran over with excitement. \u201cGu Ning, finally you\u2019re here! Come on, show me the jade!\u201d Qin Yifan urged.\u201cRelax! Let\u2019s get inside first.\u201d Gu Ning rolled her eyes. It wasn\u2019t appropriate to take out such a priceless object in public.Qin Yifan wore an embarrassed smile. He immediately welcomed Gu Ning inside.The minute Gu Ning stepped in, all the staff in Yicui Jade-store recognized her. She had been here with the King\u2019s Green last time, which was too shocking to forget.Seeing their boss so excited, everyone thought the girl must have some valuable jade to sell again this time.Thinking of that, the crowd couldn\u2019t stay calm any longer. They all fixed their eyes on Gu Ning, but Qin Yifan guided Gu Ning walking to his office. They couldn\u2019t see it for themselves, and were all disappointed.Once the two were in the office, Qin Yifan invited Gu Ning to have a seat. He then urged, \u201cNow, can you show me the jade?\u201dGu Ning smiled resignedly. She took off her backpack and opened it. The jade was wrapped carefully. She handed it to Qin Yifan.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90Qin Yifan almost grabbed the package from Gu Ning and opened it at once.When he saw the jade inside, he was shocked dumb. He looked at Gu Ning. It was so unbelievable! \u201cThis-this is Fulushou jade!\u201dAnd it was huge.It was universally acknowledged that Fulushou jade was as rare as the King\u2019s Green. It was too rare to buy one even if you were super rich.\u201cYes. I plan to use it to make four bracelets, four pairs of earrings, four pendants, and a wide ring. The wide ring is merely the size of your thumb. And the rest can be made into a few pendants or pairs of earrings,\u201d Gu Ning said.Hearing that, Qin Yifan took a heavy breath in. \u201cDo you want us to design their patterns?\u201d he asked.\u201cYes. As for the jade pendants, one should be engraved with a snake, one engraved with a cow, one engraved with a rabbit, and one engraved with a dragon.\u201d These are the Chinese zodiac signs of Gu Man, Gu Qing, Gu Ning, and Jiang Xinyue.\u201cIn the same order, please carve \u201cMan\u201d, \u201cQing\u201d, \u201cNing\u201d and \u201cYue\u201d on the backs separately. And please do the same thing on the inside of the four bracelets. I\u2019ve already written them down on the paper. As for the earrings, there is no specific request. Just don\u2019t be too common, please. For the wide ring, please carve \u201cXu\u201d inside. As for the rest of the jade, make whatever jewelry you can make.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d Qin Yifan answered. He felt like saying something.Gu Ning noticed, and she thought Qin Yifan wanted help, so she asked him, \u201cJust tell me if want to say something!\u201dQin Yifan still felt a little embarrassed to open his mouth, but after a while, he asked, \u201cDo you plan to send the jewelry made from the rest of the jade to others?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m going to sell them,\u201d Gu Ning said.Knowing that, Qin Yifan was immediately happy. He immediately asked with anticipation, \u201cCould you please sell the rest of the jade to me?\u201dQin Yifan wanted to use the Fulushou jade to make earrings and pendants for his mother.Gu Ning didn\u2019t know what to say at first. She had intended to put the Fulushou jewelry in her shop to attract customers, but since Qin Yifan had asked her, she wasn\u2019t willing to turn him down. With her Jade Eyes, Gu Ning would be able to discover more valuable jade as long as she went to Province Y.Therefore, Gu Ning agreed, \u201cNo problem.\u201dQin Yifan was thrilled to have Gu Ning\u2019s affirmative answer.Except for the part that Gu Ning needed to make jewelry, there was enough left over to make another two jade pendants and two pairs of earrings. Qin Yifan planned to make a pendant and a pair of earrings for both his mother and his elder sister.Qin Yifan also didn\u2019t charge Gu Ning for the carving. No matter if he was being thankful, or he simply didn\u2019t want to charge Gu Ning, the fee was excluded.Gu Ning insisted on paying the fee in vain, so she agreed at the end.Qin Yifan was always active when Gu Ning was involved. He promised that the jewelry would be done after three days.Three days were more than enough time.Gu Ning still had classes this afternoon, so she didn\u2019t stay there much longer.Qin Yifan proposed to send her back, but Gu Ning refused. She didn\u2019t want her schoolmates to gossip.Qin Yifan understood, so he gave up.Gu Ning had come here in a hurry and hadn\u2019t eaten yet. She planned to eat at the underground first floor before going back.It was almost 1:30 pm, and Gu Ning still had enough time to eat.Gu Ning ordered her meal and it was soon prepared. While she enjoyed eating, a dark shadow sat down across from her.Gu Ning raised her head. She was shocked when she saw the man.It was him! Why was he here?\u201cWhat?\u201dGu Ning was so surprised that she sprayed rice all over the man\u2019s body. Leng Shaoting was immediately displeased.Gu Ning felt embarrassed. She immediately apologized, \u201cSorry, my fault. I didn\u2019t do it on purpose. Please forgive me.\u201dShe handed tissues to Leng Shaoting without delay.Leng Shaoting frowned a little. He took the tissues and wiped the rice off of his clothes.Luckily, he easily cleaned it up after a few wipes.\u201cWell, um, why are you here?\u201d Gu Ning asked.Although she asked the question, she already knew the answer.Indeed\u2026\u201cThe gun,\u201d the man said coldly and didn\u2019t say anything else.Gu Ning\u2019s face changed slightly. That man was indeed smart. He knew that she had hidden a gun with her, and he had chased her all the way, but so what? She had already hidden the gun in the telepathic eye space. It was impossible for him to find it.Accordingly, Gu Ning soon calmed herself down. She pretended to be innocent, \u201cWhat gun?\u201dKnowing Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t admit it, Leng Shaoting wasn\u2019t mad, but remained patient. \u201cThe man who has been knocked unconscious by you in private room 503. His gun is missing. You must have taken it away.\u201d\u201cWhy must it only be me because the gun is missing?\u201d Gu Ning retorted, although she did take the gun.\u201cIf it\u2019s not you, then it must be the guy who was with you,\u201d Leng Shaoting said.Leng Shaoting still believed it must have been Gu Ning who took the gun.Gu Ning was speechless.She wanted to say that the hotel manager may have taken it, but she couldn\u2019t do it. She didn\u2019t want to blame others for what she had done.\u201cI didn\u2019t take it. I need to attend my classes, and I have no time to be talking to you. Bye.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t know what to say, so she could only run away. She put on her backpack, walking ahead.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t stop her, which surprised Gu Ning. Did he give up?Gu Ning was wrong. The man didn\u2019t stop her, but followed her.At the beginning, Gu Ning believed that they might be going the same way, but no matter where she went, he would walk behind her. He was apparently following her.\u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d Gu Ning asked resignedly. Did she have to give the gun back to him?\u201cI\u2019ll follow you until you give the gun back to me,\u201d Leng Shaoting said.Gu Ning was speechless again, but she was really reluctant to give the gun back to him.Although she knew she couldn\u2019t easily get away with it, she wanted to give it a try.\u201cSince you believe the gun is with me, you can search for it!\u201d Gu Ning stepped forward, like she was prepared for him to search her body.Leng Shaoting unconsciously stepped back. He frowned a little with a look of dislike in his eyes.\u201cI said I didn\u2019t take the gun, and you won\u2019t believe it. Now I let you search for it, but you don\u2019t want to do it. So, please stop following me, or I\u2019ll call the police,\u201d Gu Ning threatened him, then turned around walking away.This time, Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t follow her up. He stood there still watching Gu Ning disappear from his sight.However, it didn\u2019t mean he already gave up just like that. He simply didn\u2019t want to cause a scene.Seeing that Leng Shaoting stopped following her, Gu Ning was relieved.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91She wasn\u2019t afraid that he\u2019d searched for the gun, but she also didn\u2019t want to cause a scene.When Gu Ning got back to her school, it was five minutes away from the start of class. Thus Gu Ning immediately ran to her classroom from the gate.However, when she was about to enter the teaching building, someone stood in her way. If she hadn\u2019t stopped on time, she would have knocked him over.Seeing that the person was Qin Zheng, Gu Ning was upset. She avoided him, wanting to leave.\u201cGu Ning, can we talk?\u201d Qin Zheng asked her at once.Gu Ning hadn\u2019t replied to his message on Friday. He had been annoyed, but he couldn\u2019t help but worry about her, so he had sent another message to Gu Ning on Saturday.The result had been the same.Qin Zheng had then directly called Gu Ning. Surprisingly he found out that Gu Ning had already blocked him. He was so mad at Gu Ning that he had decided to not care about her any more.When he hadn\u2019t seen Gu Ning on Monday, he had wanted to ask Mu Ke about it, but felt embarrassed to do so.He had heard about what had happened from Gu Xiaoxiao this morning.\u201cI have nothing to talk to you about,\u201d Gu Ning said plainly. She wanted to avoid Qin Zheng, but was stopped by him again.Gu Ning\u2019s cold attitude aggravated Qin Zheng. He said with slight anger, \u201cGu Ning, how could you be so unkind? I just wanted to help after I heard that you had been kicked out of your old house.\u201d\u201cI am unkind? Help me?\u201d Hearing that, Gu Ning laughed in a sarcastic way. She looked at him with dislike. \u201cQin Zheng, is there anyone who\u2019ve told you that you\u2019re very arrogant?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Qin Zheng was annoyed at being humiliated by Gu Ning.He did want to help her, but she said that he was merely being arrogant.Apparently, Qin Zheng still didn\u2019t understand Gu Ning\u2019s words.\u201cBesides, how come I am the unkind person? Just because I don\u2019t want to talk to you? I don\u2019t need you help at all. You want to help someone who doesn\u2019t need your help. Doesn\u2019t it sound ridiculous?\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate to humiliate him again.\u201cGu Ning, you\u2026\u201d Qin Zheng\u2019s face turned red, and his eyes were ablaze with anger.\u201cStay away from me, or you\u2019ll pay for it,\u201d Gu Ning threatened him. Then she left directly.Qin Zheng intended to keep arguing with Gu Ning, but hearing Gu Ning\u2019s warning, he somehow couldn\u2019t say a word. He did feel threatened.At the same time, he also felt greatly humiliated. He wanted to teach Gu Ning a lesson right now to vent his anger. At the same time, he wasn\u2019t willing to see anything bad happen to her. The boy now had mixed emotions.On the stairs, Gu Xiaoxiao was glaring at Gu Ning.Obviously, she had seen and heard Gu Ning talking with Qin Zheng just then.Gu Ning ignored her, but when she walked past, she gave Gu Xiaoxiao a provocative look.Gu Xiaoxiao wanted to tear her into pieces right away, but she didn\u2019t dare to do it.Why? Why did Qin Zheng want to help Gu Ning? He was Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s boyfriend now!Did Qin Zheng really fall in love with Gu Ning because of her changes recently?No, impossible!Even though Gu Ning had changed, she was still a poor girl, who could never match with Qin Zheng.Qin Zheng turned around. He saw Gu Xiaoxiao who was in a rage right in front of him. He immediately knew something was wrong. \u201cXiaoxiao, please don\u2019t be mad at me. I just felt guilty about what had happened before, so I want to help her. Nothing else,\u201d Qin Zheng explained.\u201cBut she is fine now!\u201d Gu Xiaoxiao retorted. She wasn\u2019t criticizing Qin Zheng actually. She was simply dissatisfied to see Qin Zheng wanting to help Gu Ning.\u201cI know she\u2019s fine now, but we were the cause after all. Do you know, I\u2019m not a cold-blooded person. I\u2019ve already done evil things because of you. Can you still not believe my loyalty to you?\u201d Qin Zheng lied skilfully. He was an adept liar.Gu Xiaoxiao felt better after Qin Zheng\u2019s explanation, but she still warned him, \u201cDon\u2019t ever talk to her or help her again. She deserved to be kicked out of the old house.\u201dIn Gu Xiaoxiao\u2019s eyes, Gu Ning was wrong in everything.\u201cFine, fine. Class is almost starting. Let\u2019s go back!\u201d Qin Zheng answered airily. He himself didn\u2019t even notice that his attitude towards Gu Xiaoxiao had changed gradually.Gu Xiaoxiao closed her mouth, but she now hated Gu Ning more than ever.\u2026After the evening class, Gu Ning failed to notice that Leng Shaoting was following her again.Even though there were many students in school uniforms in the evening, Leng Shaoting still recognized Gu Ning from the first glance.However, when he found out that Gu Ning didn\u2019t take a bus or a taxi, but ran home, he was surprised.He knew Gu Ning was good at fighting, but it was dangerous for a teenage girl to run home at night.Leng Shaoting had intended to take the gun back from Gu Ning, but now he somehow felt worried about the girl. He suddenly forgot his real goal, but wanted to protect her secretly.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t realize it until they were close to Fenghua Luxury Mansion.She lived in Fenghua Luxury Mansion?Leng Shaoting wanted to approach Gu Ning for the gun, but she greeted a middle-aged man, then walked inside with him.Leng Shaoting believed that the man was Gu Ning\u2019s father, but no matter who he was, Leng Shaoting wouldn\u2019t show up as long as there was someone else with Gu Ning.Therefore, he could only continue to follow her to find out what her address was.The middle-aged man was Jiang Xu. Gu Qing wanted to eat fruit, so he went out to buy some. On his way back, he met Gu Ning by accident.On their way, Jiang Xu told Gu Ning about the rent for the store. The rent was settled at the price of five hundred thousand yuan. He had signed a lease of five years, and would pay the rent yearly.The store was still in a mess, and the owner needed to clean it up first, so the lease would come into effect from the next Monday.Today was Tuesday, so it was five days away.Meanwhile, Jiang Xu still needed to deal with many things. He had to register, contact manufacturers, hire staff and so forth.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92As for the registration, Gu Ning still believed that it would be faster if she used her network. The first person she thought of was Qin Yifan.If Qin Yifan couldn\u2019t help her, she would figure out another way.As for the car, most of the elder generation loved Mercedes-Benz or Bavarian Motor Work.Jiang Xu had seen that Gu Qinxiang\u2019s car was a Mercedes-Benz. After that he loved Mercedes-Benz. Therefore, he had bought a Mercedes-Benz as well; he paid 486,000 yuan for the car.Gu Ning didn\u2019t say anything about that, as long as Jiang Xu liked it.Jiang Xu also bought a computer, and the workers would come to settle the network tomorrow.Gu Ning then told Jiang Xu to help her get the network set up in her house as well.Gu Ning thought it would be more convenient if she had her own computer.Leng Shaoting followed them from far behind until Gu Ning arrived at zone G. He didn\u2019t leave until she walked inside.Leng Shaoting drove his car and made several turns, then arrived at his house. He now lived in zone C.There were\u00a0maisonettes\u00a01\u00a0in zone C. Each house was a least two hundred square meters. People who lived in this zone were truly the rich or the authorities.Well, those who lived in the zone of villas were richer or higher in the authorities.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t live in City F. He actually didn\u2019t have a house here either. He was going to one of his close friends, Xu Jinchen\u2019s house.Xu Jinchen didn\u2019t live in City F either. He was supposed to be on a vacation, but was forced to deal with some business here by his boss, so he was living here temporarily.Right now, Xu Jinchen was in a grey suit of home clothing. He lay on a white sofa with his arms and legs spread far apart watching TV, he was complaining about the actors\u2019 acting skills at the same time. He seemed like a nut who was talking to himself.He didn\u2019t have many friends in City F. He only came here for work, without any entertainment, so all he could do was stay at home watching TV and talking to himself.Xu Jinchen almost hated Leng Shaoting. Leng Shaoting seldom came to visit him, but now the man was nowhere to be found. Xu Jinchen was so bored.Well, even if Leng Shaoting was here, he wouldn\u2019t talk to him a lot, but at least Xu Jinchen wouldn\u2019t be as lonely as by staying alone.If it hadn\u2019t been for his job, he would have already had a girlfriend.Thinking of that, Xu Jinchen was in pain having to watch the actors kissing in the show.Suddenly, some noises sounded outside. Xu Jinchen knew that it must be Leng Shaoting. He immediately sat up straight.As a military man, he couldn\u2019t help but behave himself in front of his boss, otherwise he would be criticized or punished.Although it was kind of an honor to be punished and trained by Leng Shaoting, it was a torture too, because he was too cruel. Xu Jinchen had no intention to torture himself.\u201cShaoting, where have you been?\u201d Xu Jinchen asked.\u201cNone of your business,\u201d Leng Shaoting answered.Xu Jinchen rolled his eyes.He knew he couldn\u2019t get any information he wanted if Leng Shaoting wasn\u2019t willing to tell him, thus he closed his mouth.Leng Shaoting changed into a pair of slippers then walked upstairs. It seemed he didn\u2019t want to talk to Xu Jinchen.Not because he disliked Xu Jinchen, but he was always this quiet. People who were familiar with him had all gotten used to it already.Leng Shaoting stopped halfway all of a sudden. He turned to look at Xu Jinchen. \u201cI\u2019ll be staying in your place for a while longer. Please help me prepare some clothes.\u201dLeng Shaoting was terrible at choosing clothes. He only wore military uniforms or his black clothing.On the other hand, Xu Jinchen\u2019s family was involved in the clothing industry, so it only took a call for him to get new clothes.\u201cWhat?\u201dXu Jinchen rounded his eyes. He couldn\u2019t believe what he had just heard.He wasn\u2019t surprised that Leng Shaoting let him prepare clothes, but because Leng Shaoting was going to stay here for a while longer.What had happened? Did he finally want to have a vacation?Leng Shaoting obviously understood why Xu Jinchen was so shocked, but he didn\u2019t say another word. He turned around and walked upstairs.Xu Jinchen finally got his mind back. He smiled. He was happy to see Leng Shaoting wanted to take a break. To be specific, all the Red Flame team would be thrilled to see that.Actually, there weren\u2019t many things the Red Flame team had to deal with. Leng Shaoting as the captain didn\u2019t need to deal with everything in person either. Everyone in the team was super powerful on his own, but Leng Shaoting\u2019s life was occupied with work. If the assignment wasn\u2019t very dangerous, he could step aside. However, as long as it was very dangerous, he would definitely join in.They could have one or two months vacation a year, but he never had a vacation.Accordingly, Leng Shaoting had been living a super dangerous and boring life. Even his teammates couldn\u2019t tolerate it. Many had persuaded Leng Shaoting to take a vacation, but he wouldn\u2019t listen.Since Leng Shaoting decided to go on a vacation, Xu Jinchen made up his mind to help his captain have a relaxing one.Now, let\u2019s introduce the Red Flame team.The Red Flame team was the highest-level military team in the country. Although it was subordinate to the country, it wasn\u2019t controlled by it. It had absolute autonomy.That was because the Red Flame team had absolute strength and loyalty to the country. Once the country faced any threat, the Red Flame team would be the first team to protect its country.Although there were only 12 men in the Red Flame team, each person was very strong and super powerful. Moreover, every member of the Red Flame team had an absolute military rank as well as position. Every one of them was also in charge of an army.Leng Shaoting was the major general himself. He was the youngest major general in the country\u2019s history.He could win the rank of major general, not because he had a powerful background, but because he had created extraordinary achievements.As for Xu Jinchen, he was a Senior Colonel with many great achievements, but most of them had been done under the leadership of Leng Shaoting. His ability was hardly comparable with Leng Shaoting\u2019s.All in all, no one in the Red Flame didn\u2019t admire and obey Leng Shaoting.Although Xu Jinchen only ranked a level lower than Leng Shaoting, that level was a huge gap in reality.Leng Shaoting was the captain, so he didn\u2019t need to tell others that he was going on vacation. If anything happened, his teammates would call him.Gu Ning and Jiang Xu went straight to Gu Ning\u2019s house, because both Gu Qing and Jiang Xinyue were in her place.Jiang Xinyue was a ninth grade student. She was supposed to have evening class, but her parents were worried about her safety, so they had applied for her to not attend the evening class.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Junior high school was not as strict as high school and Jiang Xinyue was good at studying, so it was easy to apply.In high school, especially in the third year of high school, it was necessary to take the National College Entrance Exam. Therefore, if you weren\u2019t one of the top ten in the entire grade, it was impossible to not attend the evening class. Special situations excluded of course.However, Gu Ning decided not to attend the evening class either after she got good scores at the monthly test.Although she seemed free now, she felt she lacked time, and she couldn\u2019t do anything she wanted to.Besides, once her company was established, she wouldn\u2019t have time for classes.Now it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for her to get good academic results even if she didn\u2019t go to the afternoon classes.In the past, whenever Gu Ning was home, she felt lonely, but now, she had her beloved families around. She felt happy every day.The two families always gathered together chatting and watching TV. They didn\u2019t separate until 12 am.Gu Ning checked her phone and spoke to her friends for a while before she went to bed.The next day, Gu Ning got up early as usual, but the minute she left zone G, she bumped into Leng Shaoting who was waiting for her outside.Gu Ning felt upset all of a sudden.The man was literally everywhere!Gu Ning knew that she did something wrong, so she wasn\u2019t in mood to blame the man, no matter whether he had followed her or if it was a coincidence.Even she hated being stalked.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t care about what was on Gu Ning\u2019s mind. He walked towards her when she appeared in his sight.\u201cYou better give the gun back to me; you\u2019re just causing yourself trouble.\u201d Leng Shaoting remained cool, but he didn\u2019t threaten Gu Ning the way he normally would. It seemed he didn\u2019t want to burden her.\u201cWhy can\u2019t you believe me?\u201d Gu Ning struggled.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t say another word, but he seemed determined.Gu Ning knew the man would never let her get away with it. If she didn\u2019t give the gun back to him, he would never leave her alone. If Gu Man found out about what had happened when she had been in City G, things would get out of control.Gu Ning almost compromised, but she gave it one last shot. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not a big deal even if the gun is missing, right? Military officers never lack guns, right?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re not one of the military or police personnel, it\u2019s illegal to have a gun privately,\u201d Leng Shaoting said.\u201cHow about those gangsters with guns? Why don\u2019t you deal with them?\u201d Gu Ning retorted.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same case,\u201d Leng Shaoting said.\u201cYou must first have proof! Once you have proof, you can catch me,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cI have the surveillance video as the proof,\u201d Leng Shaoting answered.Gu Ning was speechless. She couldn\u2019t argue back this time.Out of shame, Gu Ning didn\u2019t doubt Leng Shaoting\u2019s words at all. Besides, he wasn\u2019t likely to lie as a military officer.Fine, she did make a mistake. Gu Ning planned to buy one from the black market later.Gu Ning took out her phone handing it to Leng Shaoting. \u201cThe gun isn\u2019t with me right now. Give me your number and I\u2019ll bring it to you when I\u2019m free.\u201dThe gun had been put into the telepathic eye space, so it wasn\u2019t appropriate to pull it out now.Leng Shaoting stopped for a second. He stared at Gu Ning\u2019s phone, but didn\u2019t take it immediately. It seemed he felt awkward to touch a female\u2019s stuff, but he didn\u2019t feel reluctant in his heart. After a while, he took Gu Ning\u2019s phone and typed in his name and number. He used Gu Ning\u2019s phone to call his, and then hung up when his phone rang. He then gave it back to Gu Ning.Gu Ning took her phone back. She took a glance then mumbled, \u201cLeng Shaoting, you\u2019re really like your name. A cold man.\u201dHearing that, Leng Shaoting frowned a little. Although many people had said he was a cold man, he wasn\u2019t willing to hear it from Gu Ning.\u201cAlright, I\u2019m going to school now. Please don\u2019t stop me on the road again. I\u2019ll give the gun back to you later today or tomorrow.\u201d Gu Ning ignored Leng Shaoting, and left.Gu Ning had no idea that Leng Shaoting had deceived her. There was no surveillance video at all.Watching Gu Ning leaving, Leng Shaoting had mixed emotions. Even though the girl had done something that he always hated, he found it was hard to hate her.When Gu Ning was far away, Leng Shaoting\u2019s face changed suddenly. He lowered his voice. \u201cGet out here now!\u201dIn the dark, Xu Jinchen stiffened. Shit!He wanted to run away, but didn\u2019t dare to.Xu Jinchen had to show up at the end.\u201cBoss, I\u2026\u201d Xu Jinchen tried explaining, although he knew Leng Shaoting wouldn\u2019t believe him.Leng Shaoting didn\u2019t give him a chance to explain at all. He said directly, \u201c20 kilometers.\u201dXu Jinchen\u2019s face immediately turned pale.Although he knew that he would be punished, he felt hurt when the punishment came.Twenty kilometers was nothing to a senior soldier from the special force, but he was in a pair of slippers! He was wearing slippers now!This was all because he was curious when he had heard Leng Shaoting go out early this morning.However, Xu Jinchen soon cheered up, because he had just seen a shocking scene.His boss had gone out early this morning to meet a woman, no, a girl! He even recognized that the girl was the female student he had sent to the hospital last week.It was beyond his imagination, his boss finally changed.However, the girl was merely 18, and was still a high school student. Was it appropriate if they were together?Anyway, as long as his boss liked her, it was no big deal.Grandpa Leng had already said, as long as Leng Shaoting was willing to get married, he didn\u2019t care about the girl\u2019s background at all.However, Xu Jinchen had thought too far. There was nothing between Leng Shaoting and Gu Ning.Gu Ning couldn\u2019t arrive at her school on time, because she had wasted some time on the way. She told her friends in the Wechat group to run as usual. Anyone who was lazy and didn\u2019t finish the task would be punished, and whoever reported it would be rewarded.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Although Hao Ran and his bros had an intimate connection with each other, they also enjoyed laughing at each other. Therefore, everyone was quick to follow Gu Ning\u2019s order.Twenty kilometers took Xu Jinchen almost an hour. It was quite normal for them to run as training, and twenty kilometers was nothing to him, but he was wearing slippers today, which were very uncomfortable while he was running.The minute he got home, Xu Jinchen went to Leng Shaoting before he went to shower. \u201cHey, boss, are you dating that young girl?\u201dHearing that, Leng Shaoting immediately gave him a cold glance. Xu Jinchen stepped backwards unconsciously, but he was so curious that he forgot the danger ahead. He looked at Leng Shaoting with great curiosity, hoping to get the answer.\u201cNo,\u201d Leng Shaoting denied.\u201cNo? Then why did you go to meet the girl this early morning?\u201d Xu Jinchen apparently didn\u2019t believe him.\u201cAre you totally free now?\u201d Leng Shaoting asked airily, but Xu Jinchen sensed the threat in the air.His face stiffened. He knew that if he dared to say another word, he probably would be punished once again.\u201cSince you\u2019re not dating the young girl, I would like to have a try myself. I don\u2019t have a girlfriend now anyway. Both of us live in Fenghua Luxury Mansion so it will be super convenient if we date,\u201d Xu Jinchen said while he kept glancing at Leng Shaoting\u2019s face. He wanted to see his reaction.Yes, Xu Jinchen did it deliberately.Unfortunately, Leng Shaoting\u2019s face remained the same, which puzzled Xu Jinchen.Although Leng Shaoting remained calm, he felt somewhat uncomfortable in his heart. However, he didn\u2019t know why, so he didn\u2019t think about it any further.Xu Jinchen didn\u2019t know what was on Leng Shaoting\u2019s mind, but he knew Leng Shaoting very well. He never stayed close to a woman if it wasn\u2019t necessary.However, this female student was different. He had taken her to the hospital in person last time, and now he had gone to her early this morning. It was unusual!Xu Jinchen made up his mind to investigate. Since Leng Shaoting wouldn\u2019t tell him anything, he decided to start with the young girl.At noon, Gu Ning received a call from Zhou Zhenghong.She stepped aside on purpose because it must be business.\u201cHi, Uncle Zhou,\u201d Gu Ning answered the phone.\u201cBoss, is it convenient for you now?\u201d Zhou Zhenghong asked.\u201cSure, go ahead,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cI\u2019ve already found a designer and two engravers. They\u2019re willing to work for you like me. I\u2019ve also found the store and the processing plant. The store is 200 square meters, located in the downtown, and the annual rent is five hundred thousand yuan. The processing plant is in the factory area, between the antique street and the downtown. It is 160 square meters and ten minutes away from both sides, not far away nor near. Its annual rent is two hundred and fifty thousand. Do you have any opinions, Boss?\u201d Zhou Zhenghong said without a break.\u201cNo, you can make the decisions,\u201d Gu Ning said. Since she let Zhou Zhenghong completely be in charge of the business, she chose to trust him.Zhou Zhenghong actually knew that Gu Ning would agree, but he still asked for her opinion out of respect.\u201cSure, and I\u2019ve bought the machines as well. They\u2019ll arrive in two days. A well-decorated apartment is also settled. You can move in anytime you want,\u201d Zhou Zhenghong added.\u201cGreat, thanks, Uncle Zhou. I\u2019ll be there this weekend and I\u2019ll deal with all the documents. Oh, please go and find out whether there are new raw materials in the stone gambling street,\u201d Gu Ning said.Gu Ning knew that the sales would go up in those raw materials shops after she had cut out a lot of jade there last weekend.If they had sold a lot, they must also have brought many in. Accordingly, Gu Ning would have many more choices.If there weren\u2019t any new choices, it was unlikely to get more jade.Zhou Zhenghong immediately answered, \u201cNo problem! I\u2019ll go find out later. And the car will be available tomorrow. I\u2019ll pick you up then.\u201dAfter that, they talked for a while longer before hanging up, but Gu Ning was a little worried after she hung up.What was she going to say to Gu Man if she went to City G this weekend?Oh, she could still use Mu Ke as her cover. She decided to explain to her mother that Mu Ke was going to open another shop in City G, and they needed to inspect it.Gu Ning and her friends went straight to the woods after their meal in the afternoon.However, at the same time, there was a fierce fight going on in the woods. No, to be specific, a boy was being beaten up by three other boys.The boy huddled on the ground with his head covered by his arms, and let the fists and feet fall down on his body.Not because he didn\u2019t want to fight back, but because he couldn\u2019t.Then a male voice coldly said, \u201cAn Yi, look at you now! I\u2019ve disliked you for a long, long time. Your father is the chairman of Shenghua Real Estate, so I didn\u2019t dare to deal with you, but now, your father will soon step down from the chairman position. And your slut stepmother and her lover fled with the money. Your family is now in trouble with capital turnover. If you can\u2019t get the funds this week, your family will declare bankruptcy. You better go back and advise your father to sell the company to my father. In that case, your family may survive. Otherwise, your family will go bankrupt with huge debts, which isn\u2019t good at all.\u201dAn Yi? Wasn\u2019t he the boy who had said that he liked her the other day?Also the Shenghua Real Estate, wasn\u2019t it one of the three largest real estate companies in City F? It had five hundred million yuan in assets, and was one of the third-line richest families in City F.What had happened?Gu Ning had an idea in her mind.\u201cYou never\u2026\u201d An Yi wanted to retort, but shouted in great pain instead.Gu Ning immediately ran in the direction of his voice.Although Hao Ran and others didn\u2019t know why, they followed at once.Before long, they all saw three boys hitting another boy on the ground with great force.The three boys were all strangers, so the one who was being beaten must be An Yi.Without further thought, Gu Ning dashed towards them.Those boys were knocked a meter away by a heavy blow before they even realized. They all fell heavily onto the ground. They couldn\u2019t even utter a word because of the pain.Hao Ran and others all rounded their eyes, even though they already knew how powerful Gu Ning was.What the f*ck? It was so cool!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 95": "Chapter 95An Yi didn\u2019t raise his head until he heard the shriek. He was immediately struck dumb.He glanced at the boys on the ground first, and then surprisingly found that Gu Ning was standing in front of him.An Yi felt that it was super embarrassing to let his goddess see him being so pathetic, but since Gu Ning had rescued him, he had to thank her no matter how embarrassed he felt.Thus An Yi turned to Gu Ning and thanked her with sincerity, \u201cThank you so much, Gu Ning.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome,\u201d Gu Ning said. She looked to Hao Ran and other. \u201cCome and help him go to the infirmary.\u201dHearing Gu Ning\u2019s voice, Hao Ran and others got their minds back. Zhang Tianping and Qin Zixun ran to help An Yi stand on his feet without delay. Then they walked towards the infirmary.There were bruises all over An Yi\u2019s body and face. Fortunately, the wounds were only on the skin with no injuries to the bones. He would be fine after a few days of rest.An Yi now absolutely couldn\u2019t go home alone, so Gu Ning proposed to take An Yi home with Hao Ran and Qin Zixun.Hao Ran had driven to school today. His car was parked in the parking lot outside of the school.An Yi felt embarrassed at first, but he couldn\u2019t go home by himself. Moreover, his family was in a mess right now, so it wasn\u2019t a good idea to let his family pick him up.On the way, Gu Ning asked An Yi about what had happened. An Yi told her everything afterwards.Just like what the boy had said, An Yi\u2019s stepmother along with his father\u2019s closest friend, who was the accountant of the Shenghua Real Estate, had absconded with more than a hundred million yuan in liquidity and three hundred million yuan in funds just borrowed from banks.Now Shenghua Real Estate was in a difficult position. If there was no money to keep the company afloat this week, Shenghua would completely go bankrupt.Moreover, with the current situation of Shenghua Real Estate, it was impossible to borrow money from the banks. An Yi\u2019s father was now trying to borrow money from his network, but no one would lend him anything.No one dared to lend over several hundred million yuan to him.Accordingly, An Yi\u2019s father could only sell the company to pay the debts.There were several buyers competing with each other, all trying to buy the company at a lower price, so the deal hadn\u2019t been settled yet. Although the police were tracking An Yi\u2019s stepmother and the man, nothing had changed recently.Hearing that, Hao Ran and Qin Zixun felt sorry for him, but they didn\u2019t have intentions to help him either.The amount of funds needed was so huge. They couldn\u2019t afford it.However, Gu Ning made up her mind to buy Shenghua Real Estate.Shenghua Real Estate was one of the three largest real estate companies in City F with a powerful network. Although it could barely stay afloat now, it would recover quickly as long as the funds were in place.It was so much better than if Gu Ning started from the very beginning herself.An Yi\u2019s place wasn\u2019t far away from the school. They arrived at a high-end area after 20 minutes. Although this area was ranked lower than the Fenghua Luxury Mansion, it had been built seven years ago. In the old time, it had been the most popular residential area.An Yi\u2019s family lived in a villa. The villa was huge, but seemed empty. They had laid off the maid since the company was in trouble. They couldn\u2019t afford a maid now.In the study on the second floor, An Yi\u2019s father, An Guangyao, sank into a chair. There was no one else in this house, so it was very quiet.When he heard the sound of a door opening door downstairs, he immediately sat up straight.Who?No one else, except he and An Yi, had the key of this house now, but wasn\u2019t An Yi at school?Or, was that woman coming back?He thought that it was impossible. That woman didn\u2019t dare to come back.With that thought, An Guangyao stood, up walking outside.When he appeared at the edge of the stairs, he saw An Yi being supported by his two schoolmates with bruises on his face and arms. He was greatly shocked. He immediately ran downstairs. Before greeting Gu Ning and others, he worriedly asked An Yi, \u201cYi, what happened to you?\u201dAn Guangyao didn\u2019t know what to do now. He wanted to check his son\u2019s wounds, but was afraid to hurt him.An Yi knew he couldn\u2019t hide it, so he told his father everything. An Guangyao naturally was in a rage after that, but no matter how mad he was, he restricted his anger for now. He had to thank those schoolmates who had saved his son first.An Guangyao didn\u2019t disdain them just because they were teenagers. He thanked them with great sincerity instead, \u201cThank you all so much for saving my son.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Gu Ning and others said together.Then Gu Ning turned to the boys, \u201cPlease help An Yi to go to his room and change his clothes.\u201dGu Ning did it on purpose. She wanted to spend some time alone with An Guangyao.\u201cOh, please stay here. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d An Guangyao didn\u2019t want to bother them any further.\u201cMr. An, it\u2019s fine. Please let them handle it,\u201d Gu Ning added.\u201cYes, please let us do it,\u201d Hao Ran and Qin Zixun said. Then they directly supported An Yi in walking to the stairs.An Guangyao didn\u2019t insist, because it wasn\u2019t appropriate to leave Gu Ning alone in the living room. Thus An Guangyao invited Gu Ning to have a seat, then handed her a cup of water.\u201cThank you, Mr. An.\u201d Gu Ning took the cup.Gu Ning looked at An Guangyao, who was just 40, but had aged a lot because of what had happened.Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to waste time, so she got straight to the point. \u201cMr. An, nice to meet you. My name is Gu Ning. I know Mr. An\u2019s company is in trouble now and that you want to sell it. And I am very interested in Mr. An\u2019s company. I definitely will give you the most reasonable price. How about that, Mr. An?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing that, An Guangyao was really surprised. He couldn\u2019t believe his ears.What had happened to the Shenghua Real Estate wasn\u2019t a secret. An Guangyao didn\u2019t feel surprised that Gu Ning knew about it, but, she was merely an 18-year-old student, and she wanted to buy his company?Was it a joke?However, Gu Ning behaved like a calm and mature grown-up. She didn\u2019t seem like she was joking at all. Besides, who would ever joke about that?Anyway, it was still hard for An Guangyao to believe that a student was able to buy his company. Her family was the real buyer.Thinking of that, An Guangyao asked, \u201cIs your family planning to buy it?\u201dPlease report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96: 96\u201cNo, I want to buy it myself.\u201d Gu Ning actually had the intention to cooperate with An Guangyao, so she didn\u2019t want to hide. She took it more seriously instead to make him feel her sincerity. \u201cI know Mr. An doesn\u2019t trust me because I\u2019m so young, which is quite understandable. I am too young indeed. After all, this is a deal of a few hundred million yuan! However, since it\u2019s a deal, we will need a lawyer to notarize it. The deal won\u2019t be settled until the contract is signed. Therefore, it would be too expensive for me to trap you, right?\u201dAn Guangyao stared at Gu Ning. He had no idea what to say. Although he agreed with Gu Ning on what she had said, he felt that it was so unreal.While An Guangyao was still in the shock, Gu Ning wrote her name and number on a piece of paper beside the table. She handed it to An Guangyao. \u201cMr. An, this is my number. I think we probably can\u2019t talk too much since the time is limited right now, but I do hope you can make your decision after we talk further about this. I\u2019m free this noon and afternoon.\u201dAn Guangyao took the paper. \u201cSure, I\u2019ll consider it.\u201dActually, An Guangyao had been convinced already. The other buyers had all given him a very low price. He would lose a lot of money if he agreed to sell his company to them.The moment that Gu Ning finished her talk with An Guangyao, Hao Ran and Qin Zixun came downstairs. Then they left for their school.When Gu Ning and others were gone, An Guangyao immediately went to An Yi\u2019s room to check on his wounds.An Guangyao wanted to ask An Yi about Gu Ning, but gave it up at the end.Although Gu Ning and her friends would tell their head teacher what had happened to An Yi with proof from the infirmary, An Yi\u2019s father still called An Yi\u2019s head teacher himself.When Gu Ning got back home that night, she found her family were all unhappy. She was then told that her third uncle, Gu Qinyang, and his family would be back to City F this Friday. He even asked to have a meal with them the day after tomorrow.Gu Qinyang didn\u2019t live in City F, but City G.Both Gu Qinyang and his wife worked in a national department. They lived a good life with a monthly wage of a dozen thousand yuan. Otherwise, they couldn\u2019t buy a house in City G, which was a second-tier city. They had even bought a second house the other day. Their housing fund could cover the house mortgage, and they didn\u2019t have to worry about the money at all.Gu Man already had broken off the connection with her mother and Lin Lijuan, so she wasn\u2019t willing to go have a meal with them, but it was Gu Qinyang who invited her, so it wasn\u2019t appropriate if she didn\u2019t show up.Although they weren\u2019t intimate, they were brother and sister after all. They hadn\u2019t done anything bad to Gu Man, even though they had never helped her either.Gu Ning didn\u2019t express her opinion. It was all up to Gu Man.At the end, Gu Man agreed. Therefore, Gu Ning decided to go to City G on Saturday.She knew that those people in the Gu Family didn\u2019t want to see her, but she was worried about Gu Man.Although Gu Qing and Jiang Xu would be there as well, both of them were a little weak. If there was any argument, they wouldn\u2019t be able help at all.Gu Ning didn\u2019t remember that she still had to give the gun back to Leng Shaoting until she was about to go to bed. Although she was reluctant to do that, she had to fulfill her promise.She had to give it back anyway, so she decided to give it back earlier.Thus she sent a message to Leng Shaoting, and told him to wait for her at the gate of zone G at 5 am in the morning. She would give the gun back to him then. If he was late, she would leave directly.Alright, Gu Ning admitted she purposely set such an early time. If he wanted the gun, then he had to be patient.However, when Leng Shaoting received the message, he wasn\u2019t in City F, so he could only send a message back asking for a rain check.Gu Ning was speechless. She typed and sent:\u00a0I want to give it back to you, but you\u2019re absent. I think the gun doesn\u2019t want to go back to you at all. Why don\u2019t you leave it with me?She didn\u2019t know whether Leng Shaoting had seen her message or not, because he didn\u2019t reply any more.The next day, Gu Ning walked out of zone G.Xu Jinchen was in a sport suit, and \u201caccidentally\u201d ran over from the other side towards Gu Ning. He met Gu Ning with a surprised face. \u201cOh, it\u2019s you! What a coincidence! Are you going to school now?\u201d he asked.It wasn\u2019t a coincidence at all. Xu Jinchen actually did it on purpose.\u201cYes, are you running at such an early time?\u201dAlthough Gu Ning barely knew him, she greeted him friendly, given that he had helped her.\u201cYeah. Do you live here too? I live in zone C, and we\u2019re neighbors. Oh, what\u2019s your name by the way? I\u2019m Xu Jinchen,\u201d the man asked, although he came to Gu Ning for a reason.\u201cI\u2019m Gu Ning,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cNice to meet you. Can I ask you a question? What\u2019s your relationship with Shaoting? Please don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m simply curious about that. I grew up with Shaoting, and I work with him now. I have never seen him being with a girl before.\u201d Xu Jinchen didn\u2019t bother to hide.Had never been with a girl?Gu Ning was shocked at first, but then she understood it. Leng Shaoting was such a cold man. There properly wasn\u2019t any woman who wasn\u2019t afraid of him.Even Gu Ning felt stressed in front of him.Because Gu Ning had a little disagreement with Leng Shaoting, she said, \u201cMaybe he is gay. I barely know him. We have just met for several times, so there is nothing between us.\u201dGay?Hearing that, Xu Jinchen was astonished for a second then snorted with laughter, \u201cHa-ha, ha-ha, we thought the same thing before, but I promise you Shaoting is definitely not gay.\u201d\u201cOh, have you tried?\u201d Gu Ning put on an evil face.Xu Jinchen immediately understood, and argued, \u201cNonsense! I have never ever done that! I like women.\u201dGu Ning shrugged. \u201cMaybe, he only likes himself!\u201d\u201cHa-ha, you\u2019re so funny.\u201d Xu Jinchen laughed again. \u201cYeah, maybe you\u2019re right. He is in love with himself.\u201dAfter a while, Gu Ning said, \u201cSorry, I have to leave for my classes.\u201d\u201cOh, right.\u201d Xu Jinchen didn\u2019t want to bother her any longer.However, he didn\u2019t believe that there was nothing going on between Gu Ning and Leng Shaoting. Otherwise, why had Leng Shaoting come to meet her so early in the morning?Maybe Leng Shaoting was still chasing her!Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 97": "Chapter 97Ever since Chu Peihan, Hao Ran and the others had regarded Gu Ning as their boss, they almost didn\u2019t miss a class afterwards. All of their teachers and classmates found it very odd, but for those teachers, they were very happy to see it.The last thing that the head teacher wanted to see was that there were students who were absent from classes.After the morning classes, Gu Ning received a phone call from An Guangyao on her way to the canteen. He wanted to talk to her about the acquisition deal.Gu Ning didn\u2019t feel surprised that An Guangyao came to her. She assumed that he would call her this noon, or afternoon.Gu Ning also wanted to settle the deal soon. Even if she had no time, she would make an effort to be available.Gu Ning left the school after she told her friends that she was going out.Although her friends were all curious, they didn\u2019t ask since Gu Ning wasn\u2019t willing to tell them.Everyone had their own secrets.For Gu Ning\u2019s convenience, An Guangyao met her in a nearby restaurant. It only took a dozen minutes to get there by walking.An Guangyao had already arrived.Since the deal was very important, An Guangyao booked a private room.\u201cMiss Gu, nice to meet you. Please have a seat.\u201d When Gu Ning stepped inside, An Guangyao immediately stood up and welcomed her. He treated her with great respect.Indeed, dignity had nothing to do with age in front of power.The minute that Gu Ning sat down, An Guangyao let Gu Ning order first.Gu Ning didn\u2019t hesitate. She ordered two dishes, while An Guangyao ordered one.Three dishes would be enough for them.They got down to business before the dishes were even on the table.\u201cMiss Gu, the most reasonable price for Shenghua Real Estate is four hundred million yuan. What\u2019s your opinion?\u201d An Guangyao asked.Four hundred million yuan wasn\u2019t much, but was much higher than the offers from other buyers.Businessmen valued profits most, so they all wanted to gain the most at the lowest price.However, four hundred million yuan was just enough for An Guangyao to pay his debts. He could only keep his house and a car at the price of one million, but he would still have to sell the house and the car for money to support his family.\u201cNo problem.\u201dGu Ning agreed without second thought, which surprised An Guangyao. He didn\u2019t know what to do all of a sudden.Actually, Gu Ning couldn\u2019t pay four hundred million yuan right now. Her own company needed a hundred million, and she only had three hundred million yuan left, but she planned to go to City G this weekend for stone gambling.If she could cut out more jade, she could sell them. If not, she still could sell some that she had stored in the telepathic eye space.Thus she said, \u201cHowever, I only have three hundred million yuan in cash with me now. I\u2019m afraid we must wait until after this weekend to sign the contract.\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d An Guangyao agreed. He understood that it took time to collect the money to buy a huge company.Therefore, it wasn\u2019t a problem to wait for a few days.Besides, the Shenghua Real Estate could still run for around a week.\u201cMr. An, actually, I like a win-win situation more,\u201d Gu Ning suddenly said.An Guangyao was struck dumb for a second. He didn\u2019t know what the meaning of Gu Ning\u2019s words were. He asked, \u201cMiss Gu, what do you mean?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know whether the police can help you get the money back. If they get the money back, it won\u2019t be hard for you to run the business continuously. However, if the money is lost like that, you will be in a great trouble. Thus, I have an idea,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cWhat idea?\u201d An Guangyao asked.\u201cMr. An, you must also know that I am only a high school student. I don\u2019t have time to run a company myself. So I want to find someone with the ability to help me. Mr. An, you\u2019re the founder of Shenghua Real Estate. You have everything a chairman needs. Therefore, I intend to hire you to continue to serve as the chairman of Shenghua Real Estate. In other words, I\u2019ll stay behind the scenes. In return, you\u2019ll get a very generous salary and 20% shares of the company. Moreover, you will have the absolute right to manage the company. Under normal circumstances, I won\u2019t interfere with your decisions, unless it is necessary, or you can\u2019t decide on what to do. Mr. An, are you willing to do that?\u201d Gu Ning said.An Guangyao was totally shocked to hear that.What?A very generous salary and 20% shares of the company to hire him as the chairman with absolute right over it?20% of the shares wasn\u2019t a small amount of money!That was literally a free lunch out of the blue! An Guangyao felt that it was so unreal.However, he had to admit that he was eager to accept it, because he really didn\u2019t want to leave Shenghua Real Estate. He had spent half of his life to build Shenghua Real Estate. He was the only person who knew what he had been through for the company.However, it was too good to be true. An Guangyao cautiously asked, \u201cMiss Gu, 20% shares are not a small amount. You also want me to be fully in charge of the company. Are you sure this isn\u2019t a joke or a lie? Besides, why do you trust me?\u201d\u201cMr. An, you\u2019re in a mess now only because you\u2019ve met those evil people. However, you can\u2019t deny your ability. Your ability and your network can help me save a lot of effort. You also need to manage the company as usual, but actually you\u2019re working for me. Now do you still believe you\u2019re the one who benefits the most from the deal?\u201d Gu Ning said to comfort him.An Guangyao thought what Gu Ning had just said was reasonable. He was immediately relieved.Gu Ning added, \u201cBesides, I never doubt my employees. If you treat me with sincerity, I\u2019ll give you a thriving future, but if you betray me, you\u2019ll be dead. No way around it.\u201dGu Ning said the same thing to An Guangyao as what she had said to Zhou Zhenghong. She promised and warned together.Gu Ning even delightedly threatened An Guangyao when she was saying the word \u201cdead\u201d. An Guangyao immediately felt that it was hard to breathe, as if he had sensed the smell of death.He was now completely shocked by an 18-year-old girl\u2019s power.Compared with Zhou Zhenghong, An Guangyao was more sophisticated. He believed Gu Ning must be an extraordinary girl.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98However, he had no intention to guess Gu Ning\u2019s real background. As long as he could feel Gu Ning\u2019s sincerity to hire him, he was willing to work for her. Even though Gu Ning hired him for his ability and network, she did help him a lot.Therefore, An Guangyao had no reason to refuse. He wasn\u2019t an idiot.\u201cI personally look forward to working with Mr. An very much, but it\u2019s all up to you. You can make the decision on your own,\u201d Gu Ning said. However, she already knew An Guangyao would agree.An Guangyao finally got his mind back. He felt like crying, but he forced himself not to.Suddenly, An Guangyao stood up and bowed to Gu Ning. He said with seriously, \u201cMiss Gu, thank you so much for you trust and generosity. I promise that I\u2019ll manage the company as always. I\u2019ll never let you down!\u201dSince An Guangyao accepted the deal, Gu Ning was his boss from now on, but Gu Ning wasn\u2019t an arrogant person. No matter what had happened, An Guangyao was much older than her. She didn\u2019t want to be disrespectful. Thus she stood up at once.\u201cMr. An, it\u2019s a great pleasure to work with you.\u201d Gu Ning held her hand out to An Guangyao. They shook hands, and the deal was done.\u201cThere is also another very important thing. What I need is a company with the absolute right to make decisions. That is to say, this company must be completely in the control of you and me. I don\u2019t like to argue a lot before making decisions. No one can build a thriving business on quarrels. Those who like arguing could do nothing with the money.\u201d\u201cSo, I will remove all shareholders. There will be only three shares of Shenghua. I\u2019ll have 70% shares, and you\u2019ll have 20% shares, while the other 10% shares are for the market. If they want to stay in Shenghua, I will arrange suitable positions for them. However, I only want loyal people,\u201d Gu Ning said with determination.She wouldn\u2019t give up on that, because she didn\u2019t need to find fund like others, she wouldn\u2019t allow anyone to do nothing while being paid.Hearing that, An Guangyao was astonished again. This girl was really ambitious!However, he respected her ambition.No one would want outsiders to share his or her own properties.Like what Gu Ning had said, many people would do nothing but argue while being paid. Especially when it came to settling deals, many of them would disagree with each other, then they would start to argue a lot.An Guangyao knew that so well.Some were cowards who were afraid to take risks, so they stopped the project. Accordingly, the project couldn\u2019t move on smoothly.Right now, An Guangyao admired Gu Ning\u2019s determination more than ever. He was also more confident about the future ahead.At that time, the dishes were put on the table, so Gu Ning and An Guangyao began to eat.Since the time was limited, Gu Ning seized every minute to talk about the business.She opened her mouth, \u201cOh, how do you manage the construction materials?\u201d\u201cThe manufacturers never sell goods to the outside, so we turn to agencies for the materials,\u201d An Guangyao said.\u201cIs the building materials you need to build the community a one-time contract with the agency?\u201d Gu Ning asked.\u201cNot really. Because the general communities are built in one, two, or three phases, we sign the contract according to the phase. The first phase of Shenghua is currently under construction. The second phase will soon begin. If the seller isn\u2019t satisfied with the construction materials, he can stop renewing the contract, but that rarely happens, because the seller will normally use a brand for a long time,\u201d An Guangyao said.Knowing that, Gu Ning was relieved, \u201cMr. An, actually, my uncle is preparing to go into the business of construction materials, and I\u2019m considering letting him be the agency of the construction materials for Shenghua Real Estate. Of course, I also have my own bottom line. I will only help him because he has the ability. So please don\u2019t worry that I\u2019ll lower the standards of the project because I want to help my family. If so; I would rather give him an amount of money instead.\u201d\u201cI also don\u2019t plan on letting my family know about my properties. After all, I am too young now, and I don\u2019t want them to worry about me. So please don\u2019t worry about our connection, but run the business as usual,\u201d Gu Ning said.Although she handed the company over to An Guangyao, the property would soon be hers. She naturally had the right to control it, and she would make full use of it.An Guangyao didn\u2019t think that it was inappropriate, so he happily agreed.\u201cOh, Mr. An, do you know someone in the Industry and Commerce Bureau? My uncle\u2019s company hasn\u2019t registered yet. I want to settle it as soon as possible,\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cIt\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll deal with it,\u201d An Guangyao answered without delay.An Guangyao was one of the richest men in City F. He definitely knew someone with the power.Although the Shenghua Real Estate was in trouble now, he still had his network to help him before he went bankrupt.Besides, it was not a big deal.As long as you have prepared the documents, it would be super easy to get it done with the help from the authorities.After the meal, Gu Ning went back to her school. In the afternoon, Gu Man called Gu Ning to come home soon. Jiang Xu had gotten his car, so they all wanted to celebrate.On her way home, Gu Ning received a call from An Guangyao. He had already dealt with the Industry and Commerce Bureau. The registration would be done within a week.When Gu Ning got home, everyone was so happy at getting a new car.Gu Qing and Gu Man had gone with Jiang Xu to get the new car.It was the first time they had ever been in such an expensive car, so they were all thrilled.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: 99After Gu Ning got back, both Gu Man and Gu Qing dropped the vegetables they had been washing, and talked to Gu Ning for a long while about the new car. Gu Ning felt like laughing.When they went back to cook, Gu Ning finally had time to tell Jiang Xu about the registration.Gu Ning only told him that she had turned to a schoolmate\u2019s father for help. She had a good relationship with that schoolmate, so his father kindly helped with this as soon as this afternoon.Gu Ning also revealed a little about the deal of supplying the construction materials. Her classmate\u2019s father was doing real estate. If Jiang Xu was willing to be the dealer of the construction material, he would cooperate with him in the future.Knowing that, Jiang Xu was excited, but he also felt ashamed that Gu Ning had dealt with everything for him. Although Gu Ning had said that she wouldn\u2019t interfere in his business, Jiang Xu didn\u2019t mind what she had done today. Besides, everything Gu Ning had done was a big obstacle to him. She had helped a lot.It was a Friday, and the monthly test was about to begin.Gu Ning and her friends gathered together at the football field as usual, but they didn\u2019t run. They were simply chatting while walking around.\u201cI hate tests the most. They won\u2019t make any difference. If my family didn\u2019t force me to come to school, I really would like to drop out,\u201d Hao Ran said with annoyance. Studying was a hateful nightmare to him.\u201cMe neither, but I must keep on studying,\u201d Chu Peihan said. That was the reason why she still could get good scores even though she missed a lot of classes. She played hard, but also studied hard. Moreover, some people were born intelligent. They spent much less time on learning but gained much more than ordinary people. Chu Peihan was one of them.Actually, Hao Ran and the boys were smart too. Otherwise they couldn\u2019t run their bar so well. They just weren\u2019t interested in studying. If they had been willing to study hard, they would have been good students as well.Their scores were better than the old Gu Ning anyway. They remained in the worst classroom, the seventh classroom, only because they liked playing, and causing trouble.\u201cI think it\u2019s better to keep on studying in school, even if you have a good family background, and you don\u2019t lack anything. Your parents can\u2019t support you for a lifetime. In the future, you have to inherit their enterprises. If you don\u2019t have the ability, you\u2019ll be eliminated, or replaced by the strong. Ability requires rich professional knowledge, social experience and an extensive network, and the university is the best place to learn knowledge,\u201d Mu Ke who was always an excellent student said.\u201cMu Ke is right. University is important,\u201d Gu Ning agreed.\u201cI\u2019m absolutely going to a university, and I\u2019ll work hard to achieve a lot, so that my family can live a good life.\u201d Yu Mixi had great hope for her university. She so badly wanted to change her and her family\u2019s lives.\u201cYou will!\u201d Gu Ning encouraged her.Gu Ning wouldn\u2019t let Yu Mixi stay poor after all. She would help Yu Mixi to grow up and be successful one day in the future.She would wait until her business empire was established.They went back to their classrooms separately.The monthly test was almost the same as a usual test. The first was a Chinese test in the course of two classes, a hundred minutes in all. One could hand the paper in half an hour after the test began, but no one had ever done that before. Even if they didn\u2019t know the answers, most people would not hand the paper in until the time was over.Gu Ning spent the time of a class to finish the Chinese paper. She handed the paper in, then left the classroom.Everyone was surprised to see that. It was beyond their imagination that Gu Ning would be the first one. She had always been the last one to hand the paper in in the past. Everyone knew she wasn\u2019t good at studying, so they assumed that she must not know the answers at all, so handed the paper in earlier.It was acceptable to hand the paper in at that time, so the teacher didn\u2019t say anything. However, when she saw Gu Ning\u2019s paper, she was shocked.The paper was well done in good handwriting, and all the answers were right! The writing part almost got a full score for her outstanding skills. Of course, the teacher wouldn\u2019t give a full score to the writing part. One or two points would normally be deducted.Because Gu Ning had helped Yu Mixi\u2019s studying these days, Yu Mixi knew that Gu Ning had improved her studying, she was even better than her. Thus she knew Gu Ning must had done a good job.Gu Ning went to the garden after she had handed the paper in. She was used to being alone, so she didn\u2019t feel bored at all.However, only five minutes later, Hao Ran and his bros came to her. They had an agreement to come to the garden once they finished the test.Hao Ran and his bros couldn\u2019t finish the paper at all, so they handed the paper in early.When they saw Gu Ning, they were all astonished. They had heard that Gu Ning was bad at studying, so they believed that Gu Ning had been in the same situation as them. Thinking of that, Hao Ran asked, \u201cBoss, did you finish the paper, or did you barely know the answers?\u201d\u201cI finished it!\u201d Gu Ning said.\u201cWow! What score do you think you will get?\u201d Qin Zixun asked.\u201c90%\u201dTo get 90% you had to get above 90 points. Hao Ran and his bros were all amazed.\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Hao Ran found it unbearable. Who said that Gu Ning was bad at studying?Gu Ning obviously knew why they were shocked. When she had helped Yu Mixi with her assignments, Yu Mixi was surprised too.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when the results are out.\u201d Gu Ning didn\u2019t explain further.\u201cFine.\u201d Since Gu Ning didn\u2019t want to tell them, they stopped asking.Then, Hao Ran said, \u201cBoss, today is Friday. Let\u2019s go have some fun in our bar tonight!\u201dThis was the second time Hao Ran had invited her. It wouldn\u2019t be appropriate if she rejected again. \u201cSure! When and where? I\u2019ll come to you.\u201d\u201cAfter the test, we can have dinner together, then we can go there together,\u201d Qin Zixun said.\u201cNot today. I have to eat at home. I\u2019ll be a little late,\u201d Gu Ning replied.\u201cOkay! It is in Yongle Road, the V5 bar, it\u2019s the letter V and the Arabic numeral 5. It\u2019s the mighty homonym, and is also the meaning of mighty, ha-ha!\u201d Hao Ran said.\u201cWow! I like the name,\u201d Gu Ning complimented.Although Hao Ran and his bros were all proud of the name, they felt a little shy when Gu Ning complimented it in front of their faces.Mu Ke and Chu Peihan arrived 25 minutes before the test ended. Although they were both academic, it was rare to finish the test within 75 minutes. Besides, they barely wrote down wrong answers.Gu Ning was faster than them only because she had her special power.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: 100Yu Mixi was the last one of them to arrive. She arrived 10 minutes before the test ended.When everyone got there, Hao Ran told them that they were going to the bar tonight. Hearing that, Chu Peihan was the most excited. Although she had been to many bars, she had been there with her elder brother every time and her freedom had been limited.Mu Ke also agreed to go. Only Yu Mixi didn\u2019t know how to explain it to her family, so she couldn\u2019t go with them.Hao Ran told Yu Mixi she could tell her parents that it was a classmate\u2019s birthday party. If her parents wouldn\u2019t believe it, they could buy a birthday cake and pretended that they had a birthday party. Then, they could send some photos to her parents as the proof. A birthday cake wouldn\u2019t cost much, so they planned to eat it as dessert.Hao Ran\u2019s idea was approved by everyone. They all decided to do that. Even Gu Ning had to use that excuse for her mother, Gu Man, but Gu Man knew Gu Ning\u2019s friends, so it would be easier for Gu Ning to use that excuse.After the Chinese test ended, the teacher went back to the office, and spoke with excitement about what Gu Ning had done to the other teachers. Everyone was amazed by the fact that Gu Ning had finished the paper within 45 minutes, and all the results were correct.She was a genius!No one was more astonished than Gu Ning\u2019s head teacher, Zhang Qiuhua. She clearly knew Gu Ning\u2019s previous scores. They weren\u2019t terrible, but they were not good either. It was hard for Zhang Qiuhua to believe Gu Ning\u2019s sudden change.Did she cheat?There were other teachers who also knew about Gu Ning\u2019s previous scores, who believed so, but they found it was still hard to believe that she could get all the right answers by cheating.Had the questions been leaked?Zhang Qiuhua immediately called Gu Ning to ask her what had happened, in case her student made a terrible mistake.Gu Ning insisted that she did it all on her own. If the teachers didn\u2019t believe her, they could test her again.\u2026The next test was English. It took Gu Ning an even shorter time, only 20 minutes, to finish the paper, but she had to wait for another 10 minutes to hand in the paper.The teacher had doubt what Gu Ning had done at the last test, so he paid more attention to her this time. However, he didn\u2019t find any unusual behavior from Gu Ning. She just kept writing.What was even more shocking was that she finished the paper in 20 minutes. The paper remained clean with good handwriting. Unfortunately, he wasn\u2019t the English teacher, so he didn\u2019t know whether Gu Ning\u2019s answers were correct or not. If the answers were all correct, or at least 80% were correct, then Gu Ning had to be a genius.Gu Ning immediately handed the paper in when 30 minutes had passed.The teacher purposely gave Gu Ning\u2019s English paper to the English teacher after the test. The answers were all correct.\u201cGu Ning\u2019s English is very good, and her accent is also very authentic. I even feel embarrassed for myself. I asked her to translate a piece of text the other day. No one in the top class was able to fully translate it, or they would need a long time to do it. However, Gu Ning did it so effortlessly. If I hadn\u2019t looked at her oriental face, I would have believed that she was a foreigner!\u201d Although Chen Ming had picked on Gu Ning because of Chen Ziyao, he wasn\u2019t a person without a moral bottom line. Gu Ning\u2019s English had really impressed him, so now he spoke for her.He even went to the top classroom, the first class, and let other students try it. Unfortunately, no one could fully translate it even after a long time.\u201cWhat? She\u2019s that good?\u201dHearing that, all the teachers were surprised.\u201cWasn\u2019t she bad at studying before?\u201dNo matter how hard they tried to think up a reasonable reason, they all failed at the end.Around 12 o\u2019clock, Gu Ning received a call from Qin Yifan. The jewelry was done, so he asked when she would be free.Gu Ning was occupied today and tomorrow. She said that she would be there Sunday afternoon, or the next Monday, but Qin Yifan was somewhat eager to meet Gu Ning. He proposed bringing it to her at school to her since he was free. He would arrive after half an hour.Gu Ning wanted to refuse. She didn\u2019t want to bother him, but Qin Yifan insisted on coming to her. Gu Ning finally agreed.Gu Ning was eating in a restaurant outside of their school with her friends. She told Qin Yifan to find her in the restaurant. She didn\u2019t want to hide the fact that she knew Qin Yifan, so she had no intention to avoid them. However, they had tests today, and the free time at noon was limited. Thus she didn\u2019t wait for Qin Yifan to have a meal together.Qin Yifan wanted to meet Gu Ning now, but he forgot one important detail. That jewelry was worth over a hundred million yuan. It wasn\u2019t safe to give it to a young girl directly like that. Gu Ning herself didn\u2019t care about that actually, so she didn\u2019t mind Qin Yifan coming right now.Half an hour later, Qin Yifan arrived with a wooden box as big as half a football. Everyone knew a friend of Gu Ning\u2019s would be here to give her something, but they had no idea who the person was. Thus when Qin Yifan appeared, other than Yu Mixi and Chu Peihan, the rest were all surprised, especially Qin Zixun.Qin Zixun immediately stood up from the sofa, and called, \u201cHi, my cousin Yifan.\u201dGu Ning was astonished. She didn\u2019t expect that Qin Yifan and Qin Zixun were cousins.\u201cHi, it\u2019s so nice to see you.\u201d Hao Ran, Zhang Tianping and Mu Ke all stood up, and greeted him politely.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Qin Yifan was also surprised to see them.Although he knew they went to the same school as Gu Ning, he didn\u2019t expect that they all knew each other. After a few seconds, he understood it wasn\u2019t impossible. They studied in the same school, and were all seniors, so it was natural that they knew each other. However, Qin Zixun and the boys felt that it was surprising. How did Gu Ning know Qin Yifan?\u201cPlease have a seat, you all,\u201d Gu Ning said.They all sat down.Qin Yifan knew that Gu Ning had no intention to avoid her friends, so she let him meet her here. Thus he gave the box to Gu Ning without hesitation, \u201cGu Ning, this is yours. I\u2019ll transfer the money for the rest of the jade into your account later.\u201d\u201cSure, thanks.\u201d Gu Ning took the box.\u201cGu Ning, what is this?\u201d Chu Peihan fixed her eyes on that wooden box, and asked with curiosity. Not only Chu Peihan, everyone else was curious as well.\u201cIt\u2019s the jewelry Yicui Jade-store helped me make for my family,\u201d Gu Ning told them.Everyone suddenly lost their interest when they heard that it was jewelry. Because Qin Zixun and others were here, Qin Yifan felt it was inconvenient to talk to Gu Ning too much. He also knew they had tests this afternoon, so he left after a while.Gu Ning and her friends went back to their classrooms too and the rest of the tests began at 2 pm.Please report us if you find any errors so we can fix it asap!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
